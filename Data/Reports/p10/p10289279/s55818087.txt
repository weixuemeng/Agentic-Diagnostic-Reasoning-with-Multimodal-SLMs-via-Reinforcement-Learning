                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Burning chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Convex lateral contour to the right suprcardiac
 mediastium, stable since ___, is most likely due to an ascending aorta that
 is chronically tortuous and/or dilated.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, but
 also stable.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Mild chronic cardiomegaly and
 tortuous or dilated ascending thoracic aorta.
