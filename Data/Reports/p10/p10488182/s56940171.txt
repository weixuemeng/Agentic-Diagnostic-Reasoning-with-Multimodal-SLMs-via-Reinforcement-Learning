                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, assess for interval
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Similar
 as on preceding examination or records of ___, there exist
 bilateral basal increased linear densities suggestive of either fibrosis or
 scar formations. On the left base, a surgical clip is overlying the seventh
 lateral intercostal space and projects in the mid portion of the lung tissue
 on the lateral view.  Apparently, this is a surgical marker that has been
 placed during a pulmonary biopsy procedure already noted and described on the
 preceding examination in ___.  Comparison of the chest examinations does not
 show any significant interval change during this more than three-year
 examination interval.  A transferred portable upright chest examination from___ and dated ___ did not disclose any
 significant interval change either.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in patient with evidence of chronic
 interstitial changes on the bases probably related to COPD.
