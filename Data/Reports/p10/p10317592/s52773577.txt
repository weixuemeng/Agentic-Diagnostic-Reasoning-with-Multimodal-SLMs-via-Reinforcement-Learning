                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of bilateral breast cancer, now with cough for the past
 two months, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Biapical pleural thickening is again noted.  Horizontal linear
 opacification in the right mid lung zone is also seen as an area of
 opacification in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe on the
 corresponding lateral radiograph which is new from the prior study and
 suggests the possibility of a developing pneumonia.  No other focal opacity,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size.  The thoracic aorta is elongated.  Mild degenerative changes
 are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe is
 concerning for pneumonia.  A followup chest radiograph is recommended in six
 to nine weeks after treatment to evaluate for resolution.
 
 Findings reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 2:48pm on
 ___.
