                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is persistent mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left side.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  New streaky opacities involve each lung base as well as the
 left mid lung, the latter probably associated with the lingula.  This
 appearance is very suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New basilar opacities, most likely due to atelectasis.
