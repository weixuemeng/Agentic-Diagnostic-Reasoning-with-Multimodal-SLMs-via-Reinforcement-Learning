 infiltrate progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and possible mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The
 opacification at the left base has substantially improved.  Although this
 could represent decreasing pleural effusion and improving consolidation and
 atelectasis, some of this change may merely reflect a more upright position
 the patient.
 Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
