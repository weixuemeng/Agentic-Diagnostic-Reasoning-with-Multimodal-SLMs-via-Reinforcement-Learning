                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a widespread but mild interstitial
 prominence, including cuffed airways bilaterally.  No focal consolidation. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild interstitial abnormality for which
 differential considerations include an inflammatory process of airways,
 perhaps atypical infection, or very mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
