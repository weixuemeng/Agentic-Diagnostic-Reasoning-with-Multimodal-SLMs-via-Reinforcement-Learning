 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, effusions are now better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  They are
 bilaterally moderate in extent.  The effusions have not increased.  No new
 parenchymal opacities.  The known hiatal hernia is less well seen than on the
 previous exam.  Unchanged areas of atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly.
