                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and relatively well-aerated lungs.  There are dependent linear
 opacities, likely atelectasis bilaterally, without definite focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
