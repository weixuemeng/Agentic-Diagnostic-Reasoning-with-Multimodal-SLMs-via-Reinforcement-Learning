                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with FTT  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  The lungs appear
 hyperinflated with coarsened lung markings suggesting emphysema or fibrotic
 lung disease.  There is relatively increased linear opacity in the lung bases
 which could represent atelectasis, scarring, difficult to exclude pneumonia. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Tiny clips in the left axilla noted.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings concerning for emphysema versus fibrotic lung disease. Consider
 nonemergent high-resolution chest CT to further assess.
