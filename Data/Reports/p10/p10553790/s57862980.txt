                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and right upper quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle in an
 unchanged position.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous.  Similar to prior findings, there is upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The chest appears hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar cardiomegaly and suggestion of pulmonary venous hypertension, but no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
