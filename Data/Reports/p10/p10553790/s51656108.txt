                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  History of congestive heart failure and COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle. 
 There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  Indistinct enlargement of each hilum is most consistent with mild
 vascular congestion but similar to the prior study.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest appears somewhat hyperinflated.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion, but no definite
 evidence of acute superimposed disease.
