                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, recent AVR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT abdomen dated ___, chest radiograph
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of a right central venous line.  A right PICC line terminates
 in the mid SVC, unchanged from the prior examination.  Numerous intact
 sternotomy wires are again noted.  A retrocardiac opacity containing an
 air-fluid level is compatible with a large hiatal hernia.  There is adjacent
 compressive atelectasis though lungs are otherwise clear.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large hiatal hernia with compressive left lower lobe atelectasis. PICC line in
 appropriate position.
