                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // ? acute cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior exam, lung volumes are slightly lower.  Streaky linear
 like opacities in the bilateral lower lungs most likely reflects atelectasis. 
 Additional opacity in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe is not
 well evaluated in the setting of right hemi diaphragmatic elevation and single
 portable projection..  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  The heart is normal in
 size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  The patient is slightly rotated. 
 Contiguous old right posterior rib fractures are noted.  The ninth posterior
 rib fracture does not demonstrate significant callus formation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar linear atelectasis.  Additional opacity in the posterior segment of
 the right lower lobe is not well evaluated in the setting of diaphragmatic
 elevation and single portable projection.  Standard lateral chest radiograph
 may be helpful to better assess this region.  .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Lateral chest radiograph to further evaluate right lower
 lung if concern of pneumonia.
