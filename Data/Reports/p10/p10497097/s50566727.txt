                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with infectious workup  // infectious workup
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy retrocardiac and left basilar
 opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Multiple remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac and left basilar patchy opacities, new in the interval,
 potentially atelectasis but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
