                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Multiple old
 right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  On the lateral view, there is what
 appeared to be posterior lower lung opacity, new since the prior study,
 difficult to discern whether right or left lung, although may be within the
 right lower lobe.  There is left base plate-like atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior lower lobe opacity seen on the lateral view inferiorly
 could be due to underlying consolidation.
