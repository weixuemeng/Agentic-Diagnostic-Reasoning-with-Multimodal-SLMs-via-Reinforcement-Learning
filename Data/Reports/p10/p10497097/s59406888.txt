                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is top normal.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar densities, worst at the
 left base, likely denote moderate atelectasis, although an underlying small
 consolidation cannot be excluded. Multiple right sided rib fractures are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear bibasilar opacities likely reflecting moderate
 atelectasis.  Small underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
