                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chronic cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  The increased cardiac silhouette may be
 exaggerated by the suboptimal inspiratory effort.  Bibasal opacities are also
 noted and they might potentially represent sequela of the suboptimal
 inspiration as well.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Repeated
 chest radiograph with emphasis on full inspiration is required for precise
 assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and the lung fields.
