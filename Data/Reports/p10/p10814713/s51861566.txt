                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status and weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were performed with the patient
 positioned upright.  There is pulmonary edema noted with more consolidative
 opacity in the right medial lung base which could represent superimposed
 pneumonia.  There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No large
 effusions are detected.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  The imaged bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with possible superimposed pneumonia at the right
 lung base.  Followup post-diuresis is advised to further assess.
