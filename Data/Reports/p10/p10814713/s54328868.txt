 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema.  Asymmetry of opacification, more
 prominent on the right, could reflect aspiration or infectious pneumonia. 
 Opacification at the bases is consistent with pleural fluid with underlying
 atelectatic changes.
