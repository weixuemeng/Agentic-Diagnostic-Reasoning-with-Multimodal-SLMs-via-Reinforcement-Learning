                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with coughing up dark phlegm, evaluate for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Allowing for that, an ill-defined airspace opacity in the right lung base may
 represent an early consolidation in the proper clinical setting. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  Ill-defined right
 hilum and right heart border most likely represents a dilated esophagus,
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Possible early consolidation in the right lung base.
 3. Probably dilated esophagus
