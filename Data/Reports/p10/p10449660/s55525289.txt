                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoglycemia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is top
 normal size, and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Increased
 opacification along the right cardiophrenic angle may be due to volume loss,
 but developing consolidation is not excluded. Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Increased opacification  in the medial right lower lung, seen only on the AP
 view, is probably due to volume loss, however, developing consolidation is not
 excluded.
