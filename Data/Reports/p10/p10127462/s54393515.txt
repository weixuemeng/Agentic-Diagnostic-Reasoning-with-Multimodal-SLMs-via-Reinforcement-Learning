                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with postoperative wound drainage and fevers,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the most recent prior radiograph, the lung volumes are slightly
 increased.  The small right pleural effusion has resolved.  No significant
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia
 is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size but unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  An ovoid radiopaque density
 with a lucent center is noted in the left upper paratracheal region measuring
 approximately 2.2 x 1.4 cm, which may represent a calcified thyroid nodule but
 is of uncertain etiology without prior cross-sectional studies for comparison
 and unchanged from recent prior. There is no evidence of free air beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Resolved small right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion
 from ___.
 
 3.  2.2 x 1.4 cm ovoid density to the left of the upper trachea may represent
 a calcified thyroid nodule, but is of uncertain etiology without prior
 cross-sectional studies for comparison. Consider thyroid ultrasound for
 further evaluation.
