 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fusion, elevated temperature, assessment for lung
 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is still at the upper range of
 normal.  The radiographic evidence of mild pulmonary edema is still present
 but less severe than on the previous image.  Minimal right pleural effusion,
 causing blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Minimal areas of
 atelectasis at the right and left lung bases.  No pneumothorax.
