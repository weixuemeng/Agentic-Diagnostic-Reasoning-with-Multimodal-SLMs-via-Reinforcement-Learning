 There is redemonstration of a left apical pneumothorax approximately 4.7 cm in
 craniocaudal dimension, previously measuring 3.7 cm. Allowing for differences
 in technique and position, this could represent a minimal increase in size. 
 There is no mediastinal shift.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is
 identified.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal.  There is
 redemonstration of a left clavicular fracture.
