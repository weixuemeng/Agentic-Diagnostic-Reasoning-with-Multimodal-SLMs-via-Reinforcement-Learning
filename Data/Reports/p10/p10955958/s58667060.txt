                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and clamminess.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged with biatrial enlargement, right
 more than left.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse
 calcifications.  Hilar contours are stable.  Lungs are hyperinflated but no
 focal consolidation is present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly, which could
 suggest trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  There
 are mild multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as well as
 within the right acromioclavicular joint.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Possible trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Unchanged cardiomegaly with marked biatrial
 enlargement.
