                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with subdural hematoma status post
 burr hole, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).  PFO with right to left shunt,
 right heart failure secondary to tricuspid regurgitation, now with
 exacerbation of heart failure.  Volume status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next previous chest examination
 with the patient in semi-erect position occurring 10 hours earlier during the
 same day.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.
 Comparison is made with several preceding chest examinations also obtained in
 supine or semi-erect position.  Marked cardiomegaly as before.  Some degree of
 perivascular haze exists in the accessible portions of the pulmonary
 vasculature, but there is no sign of advanced pulmonary edema.  Basal
 densities that obscure the diaphragmatic contour and result in a hazy density
 mostly in the lung bases is consistent with bilateral pleural effusion
 layering in the posterior pleural compartments.  Concern for right heart
 failure can be supported by the distended appearance of the azygos vein in the
 right-sided tracheobronchial angle.  This prominence existed already on the
 preceding study.  No evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities are present,
 there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  There exists no possibility to
 make any radiographic observation concerning fluid overload beyond the marked
 cardiomegaly and evidence of bilateral pleural effusion.  Review of multiple
 recent chest examinations indicates that the marked cardiomegaly and the
 bilateral pleural effusions were already detected on ___.
