                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hiv and productive cough.  // eval for
 infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal, stable. Mediastinum is stable in appearance. Since
 the prior study there has been interval development of bilateral interstitial
 opacities, with peripheral predominance and apical basal gradient, with
 potential presence of honeycombing, highly concerning for interval development
 of interstitial lung disease. The lung volumes are preserved. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No definitive mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
 present.
 
 The patient is after abdominal surgery.
 
 Although the findings potentially can represent infectious process is
 substantial less-likely and correlation with dedicated chest CT is highly
 recommended.
