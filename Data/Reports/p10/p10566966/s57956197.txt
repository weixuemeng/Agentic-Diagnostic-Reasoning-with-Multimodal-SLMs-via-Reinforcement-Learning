                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate PICC position in a patient with MDS, admitted for cord
 blood transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left PICC with the
 tip at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, unchanged in
 position compared to most recent chest radiograph.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low, resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PICC with the tip at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and
 SVC, unchanged in position compared to the most recent chest radiograph.
