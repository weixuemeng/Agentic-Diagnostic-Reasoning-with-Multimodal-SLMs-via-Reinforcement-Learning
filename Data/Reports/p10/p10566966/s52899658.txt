                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Suspicion for myelodysplastic syndrome.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A central venous catheter again terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Increased density at
 the left lung base probably reflects atelectasis. Very mild fluid overload is
 suspected. It is difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Developing opacity at the left lung base, probably in the lingula. This may be
 due to minor atelectasis but developing infection is not excluded by this
 examination and the possibility should be correlated with clinical
 circumstances.
