                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver mass of unknown etiology, history of travel, please assess
 for tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates a slightly prominent
 main pulmonary contour.  Hilar and cardiac contours are unremarkable.  Lungs
 are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent main pulmonary artery may be a normal finding, though
 in clinical setting of heart murmur, could be associated with pulmonary
 stenosis.  No evidence of tuberculosis.
