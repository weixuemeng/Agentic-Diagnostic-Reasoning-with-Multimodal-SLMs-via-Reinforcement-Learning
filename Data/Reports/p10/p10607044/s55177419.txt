                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain after MVA, pain with breathing,
 dry cough all day  // r/o PTX, pleurisy and pneumonia     DRY COUGH / CHEST
 PAIN
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 Lungs fully expanded and clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
 
 No displaced fracture is seen. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall
 lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for
 detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration
 of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any
 referrable focal findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either
 bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
