                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest wall trauma, question
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and shows ill defined interstitial opacities in
 both lung bases.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No
 acutely displaced rib fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No definite rib fractures are noted although if this continues to be a
 clinical concern then a dedicated rib series with markers at the site of pain
 may be obtained.
 
 2. Ill defined, mild interstitial opacities in both lung bases could represent
 chronic interstitial change, or possibly aspiration or infection. Clinical
 correlation is recommended and a non-urgent chest CT can be obtained for
 further evaluation.
