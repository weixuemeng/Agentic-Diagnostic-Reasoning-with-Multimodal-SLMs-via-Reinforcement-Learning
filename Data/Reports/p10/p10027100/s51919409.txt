                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with smoking history and fall as well as dyspnea
 on exertion.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumothorax or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no rib
 fractures are identified, this study has poor sensitivity for detection of rib
 fractures.  If there is further concern, dedicated rib views should be
 performed.
