                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the thoracic inlet,
 approximately 6.6 cm from the carina.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky and
 patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are present.  There is gaseous distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
