                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diffuse interstitial markings by chest
 X-ray in ER/compare ,please  // f/u diffuse interstitial markings
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous examination, the patient has made a stroma
 inspiratory have ports and the lung volumes have increased.  The pre-existing
 reticulonodular opacities have substantially decreased and up barely visible
 on today's image. Notably, on the lateral radiograph, the region of the
 posterior sinuses are unremarkable, which would be very unusual for the
 presence of an interstitial lung disease. However, the cardiac silhouette
 continues to be slightly enlarged and the descending aorta is elongated. 
 Although no pleural effusions are visualized, the could be mild chronic heart
 failure.  No pneumothorax.  Known degenerative bilateral shoulder disease.
