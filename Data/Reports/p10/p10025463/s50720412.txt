                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP supine portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Transfer intubated, question ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ at 16:45.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port appears to
 be in the left upper quadrant in expected location of the stomach.  There is
 left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis or underlying consolidation due to aspiration or contusion. 
 Additional left perihilar opacity is seen which may also relate to aspiration,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infection.  There is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The superior
 mediastinum remains widened although slightly less prominent as compared to
 this prior study and findings are likely accentuated by supine position in the
 AP technique.  However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal
 injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Left base opacity may be combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
 with also aspiration.  Additional opacity in the left lung may be due to
 additional areas of aspiration, although infection or contusion/pulmonary
 hemorrhage is not excluded within the appropriate clinical setting.
 3.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
 4.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum likely accentuated by supine
 position and AP technique and appears slightly less prominent as compared to
 the prior study; however, if there is concern for acute mediastinal process,
 chest CT is more sensitive.
