                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with altered mental status, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None Available.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in appropriate position ending approximately 4.3 cm above
 the carina.  Relative enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, likely
 accentuated related to low lung volume.  Diffuse increased lung opacity left
 greater than right lungs, may be related to low volumes however there may be a
 component of fluid overload.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Visualized osseous structures are gross unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.
 2. Prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, albeit likely accentuated by
 technique.
 3. Increased lung opacity, may be related to low lung volumes however a
 component of volume (fluid) overload is possible.  No effusions.
