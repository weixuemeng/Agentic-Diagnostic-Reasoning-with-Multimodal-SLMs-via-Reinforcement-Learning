 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the elliptical structure projecting
 over the right hilus in the frontal radiograph and the ascending aorta on the
 lateral radiograph is completely unchanged.  The structure is unusual and,
 given the stability and persistence, should be further worked up with CT. 
 Otherwise the lung parenchyma is normal. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia,
 no pulmonary edema. Minimal elongation of the descending aorta.
