                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status assess for infectious process.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding
 with streaky left basilar atelectasis. Posterior left base opacity may
 represent combination of crowding of markings and atelectasis, but
 consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded.  Repeat
 radiographs with deeper inspiration may be helpful for further evaluation. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
