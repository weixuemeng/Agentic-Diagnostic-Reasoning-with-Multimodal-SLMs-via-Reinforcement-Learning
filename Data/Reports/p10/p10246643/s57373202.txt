                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, and tachycardia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, causing bronchovascular crowding.  Streaky
 opacities at both lung bases are likely atelectasis, although early infection
 could have a similar appearance.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with streaky bilateral lower lung opacities,
 possibly atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded.  If there is
 persistent concern for pneumonia, recommend further evaluation with PA and
 lateral radiographs at end inspiration.
