 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p CABG/MV repair and PPM placement  // eval
 for pleural effusions      eval for pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 EPA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 09:50 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided pacer unchanged in position.  Status post median sternotomy with
 valve replacement and CABG and stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  Linear opacity at the right base likely represents subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is likely a small right effusion.  Persistent
 consolidation in the retrocardiac region with an associated effusion favors
 compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Perihilar vascular fullness but no overt
 pulmonary edema at this time.  No pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
