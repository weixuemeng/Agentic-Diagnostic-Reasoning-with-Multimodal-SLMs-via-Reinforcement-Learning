                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Orogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  ICD and pacing
 leads are unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal widening has slightly
 progressed, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 interstitial edema.  Band-like opacity in right mid lung probably represents a
 focal area of atelectasis and adjacent loculated fluid within the minor
 fissure, and note is made of worsening atelectasis at the lung bases, left
 greater than right, as well as a small left pleural effusion.
