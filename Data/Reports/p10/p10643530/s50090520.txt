 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with change in oxygenation requirement, any
 worsening of the edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  All the monitoring devices are unchanged in standard position, in

 gastric cavity.  The patient is after cardiac surgery, sternal wires are
 projected in midline.  
 Lung volume is low with bilateral opacification for moderate pulmonary edema. 
 New opacification of the left base is likely due to atelectasis and small
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is mildly enlarged with enlargement of the
 contour of the upper mediastinum for central veins dilatation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right base opacification, likely atelectasis and small
