 Similar changes exist also on the left side with local pleural thickenings and
 evidence of surgical clips in the left upper lobe area with linear pulmonary
 scar formations and local thickening in the apical area.  There is no evidence
 of pulmonary congestion, local pneumothorax or massive pleural effusions in
