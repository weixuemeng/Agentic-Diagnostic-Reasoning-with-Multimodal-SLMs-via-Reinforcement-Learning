                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low with minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There are no areas of focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Deformity of the left
 anterior fourth rib suggests old rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
