 terminates in the stomach. A right PICC line is unchanged in position, ending
 in the mid SVC. Moderate right has slightly increased, but the small left
 layering pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size
 appears slightly larger, which may be due to a combination of poor inspiration
 and pleural fluid.
