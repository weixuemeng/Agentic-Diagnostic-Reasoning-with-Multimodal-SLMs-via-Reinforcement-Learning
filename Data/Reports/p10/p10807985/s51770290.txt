                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with unknown cardiopulmonary history with severe
 cough wheezing.  // assess for infiltrate, pulmonary edema, hyperinfilation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, there has not been a
 substantial change in the appearance of the chest.  A small poorly defined
 nodular opacity lateral to the left hilum is unchanged considering positional
 differences between the exams. When the patient's condition allows, standard
 PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful for further
 characterization.
