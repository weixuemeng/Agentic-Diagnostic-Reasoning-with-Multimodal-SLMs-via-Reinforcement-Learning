                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, hypoxemia, and e/o volume
 overload on CXR. // ? interval change in pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study of ___,  pulmonary edema
 and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved, both now mild. The right
 hilum is persistently enlarged, but looks arterial perhaps due to left heart
 failure. The previous left-sided nodule is not appreciated on the present
 study.  Conventional PA and lateral radiographs will be helpful for further
 assessment when clinically feasible. There may be a small left pleural
 effusion.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 stably top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion,
 now mild.
 2. Persistent enlargement of the right hilum, could be arterial enlargement
 due to left heart failure.
