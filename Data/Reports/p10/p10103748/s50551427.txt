                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, 03:17, SEMI ERECT
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload, hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion
 persists.  There is more focal parenchymal disease in the right base which has
 not changed.  Whether this represents pneumonia or focal pulmonary edema is
 difficult to determine.  Likely there is small bilateral effusions.
 
 The heart remains enlarged.  There is aortic arch calcification.  Scoliosis of
 the spine again is noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No significant interval change.
 
 Low lung volumes, pulmonary vascular congestion and focal density in the right
 base.
 
 Cardiomegaly.
