                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hip fracture status post PICC placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent from same day. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new right PICC with the tip in the the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  There is no pneumothorax. New endotracheal tube tip appears low at
 2.3 cm from the carina and retraction by 2.5 cm is recommended.  
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Increased pulmonary vascular congestion persists. 
 Focal parenchymal opacities again noted at the right base and appears stable,
 representing either pneumonia or asymmetric edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  
 
 Heart appears stably enlarged. Heavy aortic arch calcifications are again
 noted.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low at 2.3 cm from the carina, retraction
 by 2.5 cm is recommended. 
 
 2. Right PICC with tip in the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 
 3. Again noted is moderate pulmonary edema with a right basilar opacity which
 may represent pneumonia or asymmetric edema. 
 
 4. Cardiomegaly. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
