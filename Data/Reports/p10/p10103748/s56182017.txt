                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased O2 requirement, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is severe
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine and levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine. 
 Low lung volumes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left
 are unchanged. The right lower lobe consolidation is increased without
 significant signs of volume loss. Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There are
 aortic knob calcifications. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in small bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.    Right lower lobe consolidation is increased, in absence
 of significant signs of volume loss, this most likely represents pneumonia.
 Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.
