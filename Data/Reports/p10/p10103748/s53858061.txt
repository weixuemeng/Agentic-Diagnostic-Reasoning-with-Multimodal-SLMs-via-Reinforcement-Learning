 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post left VATS washout and
 decortication, who presents for postoperative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be interval improvement of the left large pleural
 effusion; however, this may be secondary to differences in positioning.  Again
 seen is bibasilar atelectasis. There has been an interval increase in vascular
 congestion bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax.  A right-sided PICC line
 appears to terminate in the mid SVC.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval increase in vascular congestion bilaterally.  Slight improvement in
 the left pleural effusion/hemothorax, although this may be secondary to
 positioning and technique.
