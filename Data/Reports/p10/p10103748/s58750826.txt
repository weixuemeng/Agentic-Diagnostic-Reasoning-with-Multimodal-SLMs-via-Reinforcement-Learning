                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with MRSA pneumonia.  Evaluate for
 fluid overload, worsening consolidation.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  Marked S-shaped scoliosis in spine distorts
 usual symmetry of chest.  On the frontal view, the heart size has not changed
 significantly in comparison with the portable chest examination.  Advanced
 walled calcification in arch of thoracic aorta as before.  Bilateral linear
 densities in supradiaphragmatic position persist and represent previously
 diagnosed atelectases.  The more patchy previously identified basal
 infiltrates regressed.  No new parenchymal densities can be identified.  A
 left-sided blunted lateral pleural sinus suggests some remaining small amount
 of pleural effusion, similar as identified on next preceding torso CT
 examination of ___.  No evidence of pneumothorax in apical area. 
 Position of previously described right-sided PICC line unchanged, seen to
 terminate in mid portion of SVC.  On lateral view, the posterior right-sided
 pleural sinus is identified and is free.  Mild blunting of the left-sided
 posterior pleural sinus confirms the remaining small amount of left-sided
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of patchy basal infiltrates but remaining linear
 atelectasis and small left-sided pleural effusion.
