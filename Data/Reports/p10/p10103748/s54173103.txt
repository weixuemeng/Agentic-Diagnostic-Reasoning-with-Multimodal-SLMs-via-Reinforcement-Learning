 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:06 PM
  OG tube coiled within the neck with the tip and side port terminating above
  the level of the diaphragm.  Recommend repositioning.  ET tube in improved
  posiition 2 cm above the carina and right PICC unchanged in position. 
  Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the chest.  Findings were communicated by
  Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 8pm on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:39 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after orogastric tube placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 4:31 p.m.:
 
 Orogastric tube is coiled in the hypopharynx and ends in the lower esophagus. 
 It needs to be repositioned.  Subsequent chest radiographs, ___ at 3:39 a.m.
 available at the time of this review shows that that has been achieved:
 
 With the chin down, tip of the ET tube, less than 2 cm above the carina is not
 as low as it appears, but it should be withdrawn 1 cm for optimal positioning.
 Opacification at the lung bases is probably due to atelectasis, complete
 collapse on the left, less severe on the right and improved since earlier in
 the day.  Cardiomegaly is difficult to assess because of scoliosis, but
 appears moderate, and there is probably mild pulmonary edema, though this
 interpretation is confounded by low lung volumes.  Right PIC line ends in the
 low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
