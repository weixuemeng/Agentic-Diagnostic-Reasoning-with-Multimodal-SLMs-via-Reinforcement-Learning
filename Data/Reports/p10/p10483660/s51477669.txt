                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AFib, question acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Aorta is calcified
 and minimally unfolded.  There is upper zone re-distribution.  There is patchy
 opacity at the left base and in the right cardiophrenic region.  Minimal
 blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle, without other evidence of
 pleural fluid/thickening.  On the lateral view, patchy opacity is seen in one
 of the lower lobes anteriorly.  The trachea is deviated to the right,
 unchanged.  
 
 Compared to ___, patchy opacities at the bases and as seen on the lateral
 view are similar, but more pronounced.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable background COPD.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly.  
 
 3.  Patchy opacities at both bases which are more pronounced than on prior
 films.  There is likely atelectasis and/or scarring at the bases accounting
 for part of this.  However, the possibility of a new superimposed pneumonic
 infiltrate cannot be excluded, as the appearance is more pronounced on today's
 exam.
 
 4.  Upper zone re-distribution without other evidence of CHF.
 
 5.  Known thyroid enlargement accounting for rightward displacement of the
 trachea.
