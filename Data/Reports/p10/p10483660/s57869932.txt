                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, septic shock, nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 is not included in the image.  No evidence of complication, notably no
 pneumothorax.  The other monitoring and support devices, including the
 endotracheal tube (still positioned very high) and the left subclavian line
 are unchanged.  Unchanged bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with a
 clinical history of ARDS.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions.
