                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, hypoxia and crackles on physical exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.  Diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, most prominent in the lower lung regions, are
 consistent with alveolar edema.  However, underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax or bony abnormality.  There is no free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema. Cannot exclude underlying pneumonia.  Followup
 to resolution is recommended.
