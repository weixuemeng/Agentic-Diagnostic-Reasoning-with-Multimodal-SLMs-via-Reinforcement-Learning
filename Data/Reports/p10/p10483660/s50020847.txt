                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with palpitations and cough.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted.  The aorta is calcified.  There is mild
 increase in interstitial markings bilaterally. Mild pulmonary edema is noted. 
 There is patchy opacification at the left base and the right cardiophrenic
 angle which are similar to ___.  There is no definite evidence of
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The trachea is deviated to the right,
 unchanged from the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Background COPD with cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities at both bases appear similar to the prior examination and
 may represent atelectasis and scarring at the bases.  However, infection
 cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 
 3.  Mild prominent pulmonary vasculature may represent mild pulmonary edema.
 
 4.  Known thyroid enlargement accounting for rightward displacement of the
 trachea, unchanged from the prior examination.
