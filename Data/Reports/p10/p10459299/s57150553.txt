                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Mild calcification of the aortic knob is
 stable.  The posterior costophrenic angles are not entirely included on the
 lateral view.  However, there is no evidence of pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Hyperinflation of the lungs with increased retrosternal
 airspace and flattening of the hemidiaphragms is again seen, consistent with
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No consolidation is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 COPD.  No findings to suggest pneumonia.
