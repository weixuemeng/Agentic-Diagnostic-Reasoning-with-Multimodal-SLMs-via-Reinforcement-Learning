  1.7 x 1.1cm opacity projecting over the right upper lung may represent
  parenchymal (focus of infection/nodule) versus rib process, oblique
  radiographs may be obtained for further clarification. Additional opacity in
  the  left mid lung may represent nodule vs vessel en face.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Preoperative CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  1.7 x 1.1 cm oval opacity
 projecting over the right upper lung superimposed on the anterior end of the
 second rib.  It might represent parenchymal versus rib process and oblique
 radiographs as well as lordotic view are required for further clarification. 
 The rest of the lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Alternatively for assessment of aorta and the lesion in
 the right hemithorax at the same time, chest CT might be considered.
