                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with episode of hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Cardiac silhouette size is exaggerated as
 result of low lung volumes and appears moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  There is crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the
 lung bases without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Previously demonstrated nodules in the lungs are
 better seen on prior CT.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Known nodules seen on prior
 chest CT are not well visualized on the current radiograph.
