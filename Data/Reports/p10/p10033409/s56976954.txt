 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, altered mental status, right leg
 weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal
 streaky atelectasis is noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
