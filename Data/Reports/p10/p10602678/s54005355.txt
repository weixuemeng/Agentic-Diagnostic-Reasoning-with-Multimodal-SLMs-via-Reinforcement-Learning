                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Positive PPD.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for one area projecting over the posterior aspect of right atrium and
 might potentially represent calcified granuloma, although summation of vessels
 is another possibility.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Repeated examination of the patient with anterior shallow oblique views, right
 and left is suggested for precise characterization of the above described
 findings.
