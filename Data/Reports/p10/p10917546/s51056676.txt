  Limited study due to patient positioning and chin overlying the left upper
  lung.  1.1 x 1.1 cm structure projecting over the medial right lung base with
  peripheral density, central lucency could be pulmonary lesion or external to
  the patient.  Findings could be further assessed with chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, febrile*** WARNING *** Multiple patients
 with same last name!  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Examination somewhat limited due to the patient's chin overlying the left
 upper lung, in the patient is somewhat rotated in position.  Given this, there
 appears be left basilar atelectasis.  Projecting over the medial right lung
 base, is a 1.1 x 1.1 cm structure with peripheral density and central lucency,
 unclear whether external to the patient versus possibly a pulmonary lesion.
 
 No pleural effusion or obvious pneumothorax is seen although the left lung
 apex is obscured by the patient's overlying chin.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Mitral annulus
 calcification is noted.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to patient positioning and chin overlying the left upper
 lung.  1.1 x 1.1 cm structure projecting over the medial right lung base with
 peripheral density, central lucency could be pulmonary lesion or external to
 the patient.  Findings could be further assessed with chest CT.
