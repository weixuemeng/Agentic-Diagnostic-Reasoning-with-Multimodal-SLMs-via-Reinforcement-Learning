                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative left upper lobectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the two left chest tubes
 remain in place with no evidence of pneumothorax, though a subtle pleural air
 collection could be hidden by overlying subcutaneous emphysema.  The heart and
 lungs are essentially unchanged with continued left basilar atelectasis and
 some apparent decrease of the degree of atelectasis on the right.
