                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiographs of ___, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since ___, there are no new relevant chest findings. 
 There are two chest tubes on the left side, unchanged in position.  Bilateral
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema has minimally decreased.  Given extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema, presence of any small pneumothorax cannot be ruled
 out.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Bibasilar
 atelectasis is unchanged.
