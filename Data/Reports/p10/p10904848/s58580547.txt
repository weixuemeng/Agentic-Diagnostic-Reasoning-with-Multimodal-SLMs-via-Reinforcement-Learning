                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe lobectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued increased
 opacification at the left base consistent with possibly enlarging effusion and
 underlying atelectasis in a postoperative patient.  Subcutaneous gas has
 cleared and there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
