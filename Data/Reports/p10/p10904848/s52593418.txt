 AP CHEST, 9:02 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  VATS upper lobectomy.  Second chest tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 9:23 a.m.:
 
 Second left pleural tube enters the hemithorax at the level of the diaphragm
 and ascends along the mediastinum.  The regional left pleural drain arching
 over the left lung is unchanged in position.  Severe subcutaneous emphysema
 persists obscuring much of the anatomic detail in the left lung, but there is
 probably persistence of the small left apical pneumothorax, as well as a
 mediastinal component projecting over the heart.  There is no appreciable left
 pleural effusion.  Basal atelectasis is stable.  Heart is not enlarged. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema involves the entire torso and the neck, and
 may have progressed in volume since ___.
