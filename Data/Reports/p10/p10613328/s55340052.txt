                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia with worsening hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which could
 well represent either infection or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Otherwise, little
 change.
