                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after discontinuation of
 the chest tube.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right pleural effusion has slightly increased as well as there is slight
 interval increase in basal opacity on the right.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Left lung is clear.  No
 pleural effusion is noted on the left.
 
 There is loculation of air projecting over the anterior right mediastinum and
 is most likely within the anterior pleural space and less likely within the
 mediastinum.  The bowel is dilated and should be correlated with patient's
 symptoms to exclude the possibility of symptoms consistent with bowel
 obstruction.
