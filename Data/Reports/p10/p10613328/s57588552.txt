                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change after right lung decortication for
 loculated right pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___, ___, ___,
 CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  In comparison
 to the most recent prior study, the right pleural effusion has continued to
 decrease in size, now small. There is no pneumothorax. Linear atelectasis
 present at the right lung base.  Previously seen left retrocardiac linear
 atelectasis has mostly resolved.  New subtle focal opacities at the right
 upper and mid lung are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased right pleural effusion, now small.
 2.  New focal opacities at the right upper and mid lung which are less likely
 to represent atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded.
