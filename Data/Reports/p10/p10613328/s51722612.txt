                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusions with new onset respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.  Single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to prior radiograph lung volumes are lower with interval increase in
 bilateral scattered parenchymal alveolar and interstitial opacities with
 visualization of air bronchograms.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unchanged but difficult to evaluate in the background of
 scattered opacities.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lower lung volumes and interval worsening of scattered parenchymal alveolar
 and interstitial opacities particularly in the left lower lung compatible with
 either infection or hemorrhage.
