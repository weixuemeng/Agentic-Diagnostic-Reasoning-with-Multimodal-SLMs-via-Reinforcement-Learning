                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decortication with right effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The areas of patchy opacification in the right mid and
 lower lung have effectively cleared.  The costophrenic angle is now quite
 sharply seen posteriorly.  Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right base.
