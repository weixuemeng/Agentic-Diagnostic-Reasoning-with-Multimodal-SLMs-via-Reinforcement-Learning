                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Generalized body aches, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The lung volumes are low.  The diaphragms are flattened
 suggesting a baseline state of hyperinflation, however, and there are
 suspected small pleural effusions, more prominent on the right than left side.
 Streaky opacities suggest minor atelectasis at both lung bases.  Otherwise,
 the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very small suspected pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis and low
 volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly.
