                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute change in mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 patchy pulmonary opacities in the left mid lung and the left base, overlying
 the region of the apex in this radiograph, with obscuration of the lateral
 hemidiaphragm.  Right basilar streaky opacities may represent chronic fibrosis
 and associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be
 properly assessed in this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings compatible with left lower lobe pneumonia.
