                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Night sweats and history of bronchiectasis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Pacemaker leads terminate in expected
 location of right atrium and right ventricle.  Pectus excavatum is
 redemonstrated.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated but essentially clear with
 unchanged appearance of diffuse interstitial opacities mostly in the lung
 bases, most likely chronic and related probably to a combination of known
 bronchiectasis and emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
