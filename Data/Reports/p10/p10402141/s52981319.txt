 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided dual chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. 
 Aorta is tortuous with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications again seen. 
 There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and
 probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities
 could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities which could reflect atelectasis or infection with
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Low lung volumes and probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
