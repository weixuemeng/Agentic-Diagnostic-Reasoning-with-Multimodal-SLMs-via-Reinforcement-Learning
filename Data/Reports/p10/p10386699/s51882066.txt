                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, history of smoking with weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 single-lead left-sided AICD is seen with lead extending into the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, with
 flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  The left lung is clear.  Likely old right-sided rib fractures are
 seen, including posterolateral seventh and ninth ribs.  No focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is mild right greater than
 left biapical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note that CT
 is more sensitive in detecting pulmonary nodules.
