                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left lower rib pain ax region after fall  //
 r/o fx's
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base may reflect
 atelectasis although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. 
 Portable technique and body habitus limits assessment of the rib cage,
 particularly along the left chest wall; however, no obvious displaced
 fractures are identified.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pulmonary edema, or large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and left basilar opacity, possiby atelectasis, aspiration, or
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Limited assessment of the
 ribs reveals no obvious displaced fracture.  If clinical suspicion is high,
 non-contrast chest CT or dedicated rib series could be performed.
