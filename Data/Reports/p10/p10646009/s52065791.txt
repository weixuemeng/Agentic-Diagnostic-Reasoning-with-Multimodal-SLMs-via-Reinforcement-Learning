                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA abdomen and pelvis ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the right Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 Left lung volume is slightly lower than the right.  No focal consolidation to
 suggest lobar pneumonia.  Streaky right lung base opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  Note is made of a lobulated hyperdense structure projecting over
 the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view, and over the left heart border
 on the frontal view, which corresponds to a calcified pleural plaque. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  No subdiaphragmatic free air.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of focal pneumonia.
