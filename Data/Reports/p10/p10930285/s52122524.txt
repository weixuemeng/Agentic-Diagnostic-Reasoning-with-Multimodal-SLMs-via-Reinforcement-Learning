                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None Available.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  There is increased opacity diffusely in the right
 greater than left lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely secondary to a pleural effusion.  Convexity of the
 main pulmonary artery contour or as well as widening of the right mediastinal
 and bilateral hilar contours is also demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, enlarged main pulmonary trunk, and diffuse right greater than
 left lung opacities, findings favor moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Given
 asymmetry in lung opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Followup PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended after diuresis to evaluate for underlying
 infection and to reassess mediastinal and hilar contours to help differentiate
 engorged vessels from lymphadenopathy he sought.
