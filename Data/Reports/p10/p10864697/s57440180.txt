 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke, dysphagia  // ?aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The film is somewhat limited due to the patient's kyphosis and rotation. With
 this in mind, there does not appear to be any acute cardiopulmonary process
 with the mediastinal silhouette being relatively normal in size, no pleural
 effusions, no edema and no pneumonia.
