                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right transbronchial biopsy of nodule.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates mildly hyperinflated
 lungs with flattened diaphragms, indicative of chronic lung disease.  There is
 a nodular area of opacity at the right lateral lung field, which corresponds
 to the nodule better seen on the prior CT.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 Illdefined opacity in the right lower lobe may correspond to post procedural
 hemorrhage. The cardiac and hilar contours are normal.  Aortic and carotid
 calcifications are seen.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion
 is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of pneumothorax after transbronchial biopsy.
