                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abnormality on lateral view.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is some prominence of opacification in the retrocardiac
 region.  This could well represent merely atelectatic changes and mildly
 dilated vessels.  In the appropriate clinical scenario, consolidation would
 have to be considered.
