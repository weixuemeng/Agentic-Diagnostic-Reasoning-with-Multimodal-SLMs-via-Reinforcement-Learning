 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with abnormal chest x-ray findings, low grade
 temperatures; needing further characterization  // characterize effusion,
 evaluate for infiltrates     characterize effusion, evaluate for infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification overlying the
 right mid and lower zone is not appreciated and therefore was consistent with
 superimposed soft tissues.  There are bilateral small pleural effusions with
 basilar atelectasis, though the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is
 more sharply seen on the current study.
