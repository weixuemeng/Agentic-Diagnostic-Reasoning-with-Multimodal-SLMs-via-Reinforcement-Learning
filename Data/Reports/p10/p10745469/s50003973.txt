                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe abdominal pain, found to have acute
 pancreatitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar opacities may represent dependent
 atelectasis.  However, there are also air bronchograms at the medial right
 lung base which should be followed closely to exclude aspiration.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.  No subdiaphragmatic free
 air is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  The presence of air bronchograms
 would warrant close follow-up to exclude aspiration, however the subsequent
 abdomen CT showed no consolidation in the lower lungs.
