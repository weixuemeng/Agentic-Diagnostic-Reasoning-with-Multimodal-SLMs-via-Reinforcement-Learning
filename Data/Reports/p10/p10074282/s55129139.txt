                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  Prominence of both
 hila appear unchanged.  Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.  Within the
 left lung, there is a subtle opacity at the left base which is probably due to
 a combination of a small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis as
 demonstrated on recent CT abdomen of ___.  No definite new areas of
 consolidation are identified to suggest an infectious pneumonia.  Mild
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
