                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pancreatic CA with new L sided pleural
 effusion with CT to suction  // status of effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC is present with tip terminating in the mid SVC.  There has been a
 change in contour of the left pleural drainage catheter, with slight
 retraction of the distal aspect of the tube and an area of kinking, which may
 be outside the patient.  A small left pleural effusion is slightly smaller
 than on the most recent prior study.  There has been improved aeration in the
 left lower lobe.  Increased haziness in the left mid lung may also reflect
 some pleural fluid.  Small right pleural effusion slightly increased compared
 to prior, and mild right base atelectasis persist.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are
 normal, and there is no new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
 There is no pneumoperitoneum.  Gaseous distension of the stomach is again
 noted.  A CBD stent is in stable position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slight interval decrease in left pleural effusion, still small, with
 interval improvement in aeration of the left lung.  No other acute change.
 2.  Slight change in position of the left pleural drainage catheter with
 partial uncoiling of the pigtail and kinking of the tube.
