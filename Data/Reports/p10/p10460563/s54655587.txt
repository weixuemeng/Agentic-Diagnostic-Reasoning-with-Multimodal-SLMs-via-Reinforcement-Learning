                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Evaluation
 is somewhat limited due to underpenetrated technique.  The lungs appear clear,
 though underpenetrated technique limits the evaluation through the lower
 lungs.  There is an apparent blunting of the left CP angle which could reflect
 pleural thickening or a small effusion.  Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm is noted.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal
 contour appears grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.
