                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid and
 lower SVC.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are not substantially changed in
 the interval.  Increased patchy opacities in the lung bases, vertically within
 the retrocardiac region are noted.  No pneumothorax is present.  A stent is
 seen overlying the region of the medial left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions with worsening bibasilar airspace
 opacities, potentially atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot be excluded.
