                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated, found down, check nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  In the interval
 since the prior study, the endotracheal tube has been withdrawn so that it is
 now approximately 4.2 cm below the level of the carina.  There has been
 interval placement of a nasogastric tube, coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, extending across midline, likely terminating in the expected
 location of the distal stomach.  Prominence of the mediastinum is unchanged. 
 If there is clinical concern for acute aortic injury, consider chest CTA.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not changed.  No focal consolidation, large pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen, given that the right
 costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Surgical clips are
 seen in right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm to the
 right of midline, likely extending into the distal stomach.  Prominence of the
 mediastinum is stable and may relate to supine, AP technique.  However, if
 clinical concern, suggest CTA.
