                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___F hx of factor XI clotting disorder s/p fall w/ L knee patella fx now with
 increased ___ requirement, wheezing and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dating back to ___.  Comparison is also made to chest CT from ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior, lung volumes are lower.  Relative enlargement of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely secondary to low lung volumes. The
 hilar contours have not changed, including prominence on the right
 corresponding to a enlarged pulmonary vein on chest CT. Right apical opacity
 also corresponds to prominent venous and arterial vessels. Mild interstitial
 edema is present. Linear atelectasis in the right lung and retrocardiac
 atelectasis have increased.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes with increased retrocardiac and left opacities likely
 representing a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid, in the
 appropriate clinical setting a superimposed pneumonia at the left base would
 be possible.
