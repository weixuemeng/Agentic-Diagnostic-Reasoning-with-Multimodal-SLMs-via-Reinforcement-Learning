                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained to assess a
 feeding tube, which terminates in the expected location of the proximal
 duodenum.  Within the chest, there has been development of pulmonary vascular
 congestion but improvement of previously reported left basilar opacities. 
 Linear right basilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis adjacent to a
 large pericardial fat pad.
