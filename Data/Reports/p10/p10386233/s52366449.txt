                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 little overall change.  Dobbhoff tube is visualized only to the lower
 esophagus, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  A view of the
 abdomen would be necessary to determine the precise location of the tube tip.
