                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a new right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Very small right pleural effusion has increased since ___, probably of no
 clinical significance.  There is greater atelectasis in the right upper lobe
 with the suggestion of new cavitation.  Although clinical history has not been
 provided, the volume loss in the right upper lobe and mass in the apex
 suggests radiation fibrosis, which can produce cavitation on the basis of
 necrosis, but should be evaluated for possible superinfection, particularly by
 Aspergillus.  Left lung is clear, and heart size is normal.  Bronchial tree is
 not assessed by this study.
