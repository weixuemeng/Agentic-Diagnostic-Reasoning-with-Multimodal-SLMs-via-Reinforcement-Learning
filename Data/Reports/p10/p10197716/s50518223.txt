                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer status post
 chemoradiation presenting with low-grade temperature, cough and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, whole-body PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Enlargement of the right hilus is likely due to
 lymphadenopathy.  The right apical primary lesion has increased in size
 compared to prior exam with mild leftward deviation of the trachea suggestive
 of mediastinal invasion.  Reticular opacities of the right mid and upper lung
 with may be due to post radiative fibrotic change however postradiation
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The right lower lung and left lung are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of right apical primary lung lesion.  Fullness of
 the right hila suggestive of lymphadenopathy.  Increased reticular opacities
 of the right mid and upper lung may be due to postradiation fibrosis, however,
 post radiation pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Further evaluation, if
 clinically indicated, may be performed with dedicated chest CT.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by ___
 ___ on ___ at 1:16 pm at time of initial review.
