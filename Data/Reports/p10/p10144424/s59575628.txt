 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.  Allowing for
 this, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There are scattered vague
 opacities in the right upper zone, which could reflect an early inflammatory
 or infectious infiltrate.  There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 region, unchanged.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate.  No gross effusion.  Doubt
 CHF.  Faint opacity about the intrathoracic aorta could reflect ectatic
 vessels and/or enlarged thyroid in someone of this age.  Slight elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy retrocardiac density, unchanged.
 
 2.  Faint opacities right upper zone, which could represent an early
 infectious or inflammatory infiltrate.
