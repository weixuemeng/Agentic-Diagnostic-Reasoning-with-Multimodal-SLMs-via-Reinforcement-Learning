                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  For port placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the Port-A-Cath
 appears to be in the upper portion of the right atrium.  Pulling it back
 approximately 3 cm would ensure that it is within the lower SVC, if this would
 be the preferred position.
 
 The heart is within normal limits and the lungs are essentially clear without
 vascular congestion.
 
 On the lateral view, there is evidence of interval spinal fusion.
