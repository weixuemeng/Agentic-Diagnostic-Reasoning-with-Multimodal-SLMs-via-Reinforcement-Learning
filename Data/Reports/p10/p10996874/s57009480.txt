                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  Right lung is clear.  Left hemidiaphragm appears obscured, likely
 due to a small pleural effusion.  Considering clinical suspicion for
 pneumonia, PA and lateral views of the chest may be helpful for more complete
 evaluation of this region when the patient's condition allows.
