                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with Gram-negative rod sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  2.3 cm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is better evaluated by CT. 
 There is mild increased pulmonary vascular engorgement with cephalization,
 increased heart size, and increased mediastinal venous engorgement, suggestive
 of congestive heart failure.  Asymmetric density of the right lower lobe
 compared to the left may represent asymmetric edema, less likely infection. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Aortic calcification is seen. 
 An enteric catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip in the left upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Interval development of mild congestive heart failure. 
 2. Asymmetric density of the right lower lung compared to the left, likely
 edema, less likely infection.
