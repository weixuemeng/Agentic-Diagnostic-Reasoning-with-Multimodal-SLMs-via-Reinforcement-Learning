                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Opacity on opacity chest x-ray, evaluate opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same date, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As also seen
 on the subsequent CT abdomen and pelvis, there is a 2.3 cm left lower lobe
 pulmonary nodule which is worrisome for malignancy, either primary or
 metastatic.  Trace right pleural effusion seen on subsequent abdomen CT was
 better appreciated on that study.  Slight prominence of the interstitium as
 compared to the prior study may be due to development of interval mild
 interstitial edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Retrocardiac air-fluid level is most consistent with hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe 2.7 cm pulmonary nodule better seen on subsequent
 CT abdomen/pelvis concerning for malignancy, metastatic versus primary.
 
 Interval diffuse mild increased interstitial markings bilaterally, mild
 interstitial edema.  
 
 Trace right pleural effusion seen on subsequent CT was better evaluated on
 that study. Hiatal hernia.
