                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with intubation for hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___ at 09:02.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  New endotracheal tube
 terminates 1.4 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates below the
 diaphragm.  Slight cephalization with pulmonary vascular engorgement is
 similar to prior.  Bibasilar opacities persist and focal morphology favors
 infection over edema.  No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New ETT terminates 1.4 cm above the carina.  
 
 2.  Persistent focal bibasilar opacities, most consistent with infection, with
 stable pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by Dr. ___ to ___, MICU
 resident, on ___ at 13:38.
