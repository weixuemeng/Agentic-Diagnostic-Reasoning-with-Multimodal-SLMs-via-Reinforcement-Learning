  Round opacity projecting over the left lung base, incompletely evaluated on
  this single AP projection, possibly superimposition of normal thoracic
  structures, although could be round atelectasis or developing infection.
  Further evaluation with dedicated PA/lateral radiographs is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low.  A 2.6 cm rounded opacity projects over the left lower lung, not
 seen on the prior study from ___, possibly related to overlying
 musculoskeletal structures, although an intrathoracic process such as a
 pulmonary nodule, round atelectasis, or developing infection is not entirely
 excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rounded opacity projecting over the left lung base, incompletely
 characterized on this single AP projection, possibly related to
 superimposition of normal thoracic structures, although a pulmonary nodule,
 round atelectasis, or developing infection is not excluded.  Recommend further
 evaluation with a dedicated PA and lateral series.
 
 Findings and recommendations were entered into the emergency department
 dashboard by Dr. ___ at 1:41 p.m. on the day of the study.
