                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, recent myocardial infarction requiring stent
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This attenuates
 the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal limits. 
 Thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There are
 minimal atelectatic changes noted at the lung bases.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
