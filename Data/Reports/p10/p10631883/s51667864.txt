                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of chronic renal insufficiency,
 hypertension, and metastatic melanoma with colonic metastases presents with
 hematochezia and intermittent chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous chest
 x-ray from ___ and CT from ___.  
 
 When compared to prior films, there has been interval enlargement of the
 multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, the dominant nodule being the right mid
 lung which now measures 2.4 cm where it had been approximately 1.7 cm on prior
 xray.  Other bibasilar nodules are also identified.  One projecting over the
 left lung base which when correlated with CT scan appeared within the
 subcutaneous tissues.  The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation or
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval enlargement of the bibasilar pulmonary nodules compared
 to prior plain film.  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
