                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion,
 probably with some degree of loculation along the left lateral hemithorax, as
 well as patchy parenchymal opacity, most likely compatible with atelectasis. 
 On the right, there is also a pleural effusion, probably free-flowing and
 small to moderate in size.  There is also a small pneumothorax on the right. 
 The distance between the apical visceral pleural edge and the outer chest wall
 measures about 2.2 cm.  A mild interstitial abnormality suggests mild
 pulmonary edema.  Fissures are thickened.  The bones are probably
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumothorax on the right.  Bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Interstitial abnormality suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Although opacities
 at the lung bases, greater on the left than right, are probably compatible
 with atelectasis, underlying infectious process is not entiredly excluded by
 this examination.
