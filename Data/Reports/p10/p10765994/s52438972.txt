                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer and coronary disease, presenting with dyspnea and acute
 right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Patchy increased left basilar opacity
 could be seen with atelectasis, or potential pneumonia.  A nodular component
 may reflect a left lower lobe nodule seen on the prior CT.  There is probably
 a small new left-sided pleural effusion.  The right lung remains clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are noted along the lower thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite findings to explain right-sided chest pain, although
 there is increased posterior left basilar opacification including a new small
 pleural effusion.  Atelectasis or possibly infection could be considered for
 this appearance.
