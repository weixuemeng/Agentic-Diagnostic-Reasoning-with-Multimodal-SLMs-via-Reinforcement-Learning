                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right arm weakness with history of lung cancer.  Please evaluate
 for right upper lung opacities, consistent with Pancoast tumor.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  As
 before, there are streaky left lower lung opacities, most likely atelectasis
 and/or scarring.  A more nodular component in this region likely represents a
 pulmonary nodule, as seen on prior CT from ___.  A small left pleural
 effusion is not significantly changed.  There is no right pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No radiographic explanation for patient's right arm weakness.  Left lower
 lung atelectasis/scarring and a pulmonary nodule are similar in appearance.
 
 2.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
