                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic lung cancer.  Presenting with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___. 
 CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate paramediastinal
 radiation changes. Streaky ill-defined opacity extending from the left
 perihilar region to the left lower lobe is unchanged, and again likely
 reflects residual disease.  Small left pleural effusion which is loculated
 laterally is unchanged, as is pleural thickening.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or edema.  Compared to ___, there is now blunting
 of the right costophrenic sulcus suggesting a tiny pleural effusion. Lungs are
 hyperinflated with mild emphysematous changes noted in the upper lobes. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left perihilar opacity extending to the left lower lobe
 likely reflecting residual disease. Redemonstration of post-radiation changes,
 small left pleural effusion, and pleural thickening.
