                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Small cell lung cancer, left-sided crackles and
 cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Post-radiation changes in the left
 paramediastinal area are demonstrated overall with no substantial change since
 the prior study.  As compared to ___, there is slight interval
 increase in left pleural thickening but no definitive pleural effusion. 
 Overall, no focal consolidations to suggest interval development of pneumonia
 have been seen, but it is difficult to distinguish at this point
 post-radiation changes from newly developed pneumonia.  Correlation with
 clinical history is required in regard of the timeline of radiation treatment.
