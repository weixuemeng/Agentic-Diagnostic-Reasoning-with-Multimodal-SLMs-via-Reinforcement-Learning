                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and rhonchi.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs and
 flattening of the diaphragms consistent with emphysema.  Lungs are without a
 focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable in appearance relative to prior examination.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  Slight asymmetric
 differences in densities within the hemithoraces thought likely technical. 
 Osseous structures are without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema without a focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia.
