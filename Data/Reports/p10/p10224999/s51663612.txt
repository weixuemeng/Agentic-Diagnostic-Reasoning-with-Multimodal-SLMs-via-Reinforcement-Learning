                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with potential
 mycobacterial infection in the left arm.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  The posterior Bochdalek hernia
 containing only fat is re-demonstrated.  Lobulation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is unchanged.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No definite pleural effusion is
 demonstrated, although minimal amount cannot be excluded on the left. 
 Overall, no evidence of intrathoracic infection seen.
