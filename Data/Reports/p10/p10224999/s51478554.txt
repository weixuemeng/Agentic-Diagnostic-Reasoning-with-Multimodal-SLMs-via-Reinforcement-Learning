                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided abdominal pain and tenderness to palpation along the
 chest wall.  Question diverticulitis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest and lumbar spine radiographs from ___ and
 ___, respectively; CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including a
 convexity reflecting a left-sided fat-containing Bochdalek hernia.  An
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is also unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  A thoracolumbar compression deformity appears new
 since the prior radiographs and also since more recent lumbar spine
 radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Mild superior endplate compression
 deformity of the T12 vertebral body, new since prior studies, but
 age-indeterminant.
