                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, wheezing  // rule out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mid and lower lung bilateral reticular opacities and bronchial wall thickening
 are present bilaterally.   Overlying the right lateral sixth and seventh ribs
 are rounded radiopaque densities suggestive of granulomas or bone islands.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  The cardiac borders and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Findings most likely caused by viral or mycoplasma pneumonia in this
 clinical context.  Follow-up chest radiograph after treatment to ensure
 resolution is recommended.
 2. Densities overlying the right sixth and seventh ribs are suggestive of
 granulomas or bone islands.  Additional shallow oblique views at time of
 follow-up chest radiograph could differentiate osseous from pulmonary
 structures.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 1. Follow-up chest radiograph after treatment is recommended to ensure
 resolution and to exclude a more chronic interstitial or airway process.
 2. Additional shallow oblique views at time of follow-up chest radiograph are
 recommended to  further evaluate right-sided densities.
