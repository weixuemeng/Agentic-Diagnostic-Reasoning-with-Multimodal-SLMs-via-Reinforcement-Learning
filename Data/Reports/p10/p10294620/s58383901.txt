                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with occult left-sided pneumothorax
 following assault, evaluate for interval changes.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiac enlargement but no typical
 configurational abnormality can be identified.  Noteworthy is that the patient
 is status post sternotomy, findings suspicious for previous cardiothoracic
 surgical intervention.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There are
 some local pleural thickenings along the mid portion of the lateral chest
 walls, but no other pleural abnormalities can be identified and there is no
 pneumothorax in the apical area.  On the bases, thin plate horizontally
 oriented scar formations are identified.  The lowermost portion of the lung
 fields are characterized by increased translucency suggestive of some
 emphysema.  There is no evidence of any new acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement without evidence of CHF in patient
 with evidence of previous sternotomy.  No acute pulmonary abnormalities or
 pneumothorax but basal changes suggestive of emphysema.
