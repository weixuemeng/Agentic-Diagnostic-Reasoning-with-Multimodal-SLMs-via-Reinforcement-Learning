 silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Blunting of posterior
 costophrenic angles could be due to trace effusions. Mid thoracic
 vertebroplasty changes are noted. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 Tubular structure in the right upper quadrant is most likely biliary.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles potentially trace effusions.
