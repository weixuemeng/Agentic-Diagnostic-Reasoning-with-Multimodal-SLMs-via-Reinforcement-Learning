                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with breast ca, dyspnea, increasing O2 requirements  // eval
 pna, effusion R>L
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout from prior CT scan dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen, most confluent at the right
 lung base.  Findings are likely combination of known underlying metastases
 although superimposed effusion and/or consolidation are entirely possible. 
 Left chest wall port is seen with catheter tip projecting over the mid SVC. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Surgical clips project over the right breast.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, appear worse since prior CT scan and
 may be combination of metastasis/lymphangitic spread of tumor with possible
 superimposed consolidation/infection and possible effusion, particularly on
 the right.
