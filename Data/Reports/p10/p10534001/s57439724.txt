                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening respiratory distress  // ?new
 pulmonary edema      ?new pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 02:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 07:37 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place.  There is a diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal process with more consolidative appearance in the right lower
 lung.  There is apparent increasing right pleural opacity favoring at least a
 component of pleural fluid.  The left costophrenic angle now appears blunted
 consistent with a small left effusion.  Given the diffuse parenchymal process,
 it is difficult to evaluate for superimposed edema, although the interstitium
 may be slightly more pronounced than on prior studies.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given differences in positioning and technique.  No pneumothorax.
