                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Trauma, right IJ line placement, also ET and OG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 7.1 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the images.  However, sideport may
 be at the level of the distal esophagus.  Recommend advancement so that it is
 well within the stomach.  There is a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminating in the proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Perihilar opacities raise concern for pulmonary edema.  Right upper and right
 basilar patchy opacities could relate to fluid overload; however, underlying
 aspiration, infection, or pulmonary contusion not excluded.  No large pleural
 effusion seen.
