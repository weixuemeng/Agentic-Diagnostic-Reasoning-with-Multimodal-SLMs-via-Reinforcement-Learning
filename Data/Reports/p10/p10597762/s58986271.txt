                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including marked
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The heart is probably borderline in size.
 Similar to prior findings there is a small pleural effusion on the right, no
 definite one on the left.  Mild pleural thickening with a smoothly lobular
 appearance and streaky opacities at the right lung base suggest minor scarring
 and probably some degree of round atelectasis associated with persistence of
 the effusion. Chest is hyperinflated.  Severe kyphoscoliosis is again noted.
 Bones appear demineralized. A healed left clavicle fracture appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small pleural effusion with opacity suggesting associated
 atelectatic change.  Superinfection is doubted but difficult to entirely
 exclude.  Opacity at the right lung base appears mildly nodular, probably due
 to round atelectasis, but it may be appropriate to consider follow-up
 radiographs in ___ months versus consideration of chest CT since this appears
 new.
