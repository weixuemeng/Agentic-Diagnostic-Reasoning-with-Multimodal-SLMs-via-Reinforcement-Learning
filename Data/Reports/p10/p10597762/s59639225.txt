                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for and effusion or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Clips are again seen within the left
 axilla.
 
 Lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base are likely
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and may
 reflect a small pleural effusion.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.
 
 A marked S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is unchanged.  Degenerative
 changes of the shoulders are seen bilaterally.  Ossified loose bodies are
 again seen on within the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and may
 reflect a small pleural effusion. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
