                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with an open chest after CABG.
 
 STUDY:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  Mediastinal clips are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube
 sits 5 cm above the carina.  The endogastric tube location is improved.  The
 sideport is just at or below the GE junction.  A right-sided IJ central venous
 catheter tip sits in the right atrium - if ectopy is an issue, retraction by
 about 3 cm may be considered.  The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 The lung volumes are low with mild vascular congestion.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
