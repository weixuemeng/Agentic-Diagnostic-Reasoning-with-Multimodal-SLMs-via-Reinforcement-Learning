                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Shortness of breath status post lung biopsy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the previous exam, there is increasing amount of pleural fluid
 loculated along the lateral aspect of the left hemithorax, now small to
 moderate in size.  Wedge-shaped opacity within the left mid lung field is
 relatively unchanged compatible with post biopsy changes.  Left basilar
 opacification may reflect atelectasis.  The right lung demonstrates minimal
 atelectasis in the right lung base.  Multiple nodules are again seen within
 both lungs, better appreciated on the previous CT.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified, and no pulmonary
 vascular congestion is seen.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in amount of left pleural effusion which is loculated
 laterally.  Post wedge resection changes again seen in the left mid lung
 field.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
