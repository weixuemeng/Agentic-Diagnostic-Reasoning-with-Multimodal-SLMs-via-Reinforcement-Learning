                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placed.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP image of the chest.  
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube which crosses
 the right lung base and impinges on the mediastinum.  Haziness is seen in the
 right upper lung, which has an convex margin inferiorly and may represent
 loculated pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No dependent pleural
 fluid is seen.  Opacities in the left lung base consistent with atelectasis. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of right-sided chest tubes which cross the right lung
 base impinges and mediastinum.  
 
 2.  Haziness in the right upper lung, which may represent loculated pleural
 effusion.  A lateral radiograph could be obtained to further evaluate this
 opacity.
