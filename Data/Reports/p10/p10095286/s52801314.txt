                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient on Lovenox for DVT with right rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior radiographs from ___.
 
 There has been removal of the right basilar chest tube since the previous
 study.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  There remains some increased density at
 the right base, likely partially due to the prior chest tube.  There is also a
 moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  There are no signs for overt pulmonary
 edema.  There has been atelectasis at the left lung base.
