                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly, edema or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient
 in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: Lungs are clear without any focal opacities, pleural effusion or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  An expansile lesion involving the third right posterior
 rib is of indeterminate etiology.  Please correlate for any clinical history
 of osseous malignancy (i.e. multiple myeloma) or prior imaging to assess
 stability.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 2. Expansile lesion of the right third posterior rib of indeterminate
 etiology.  Recommend clinical correlation for any history of osseous
 malignancy (i.e. multiple myeloma) and comparison with prior imaging to assess
 stability.
