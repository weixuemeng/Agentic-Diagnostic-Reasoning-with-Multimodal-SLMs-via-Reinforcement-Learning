 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP, one view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright view of the chest provided.  A single clip is again seen
 in the right axilla.  Overlying EKG leads are present.  New from prior exam,
 is opacification of the right mid to lower lung which likely reflects the
 presence of a large pleural effusion.  Compressive atelectasis in the right
 lower lung is likely present though difficult to exclude an underlying
 pneumonia.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size appears grossly stable low the
 right heart border is obscured.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
