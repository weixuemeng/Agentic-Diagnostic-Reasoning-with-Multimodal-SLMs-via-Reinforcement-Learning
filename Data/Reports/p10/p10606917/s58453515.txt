 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with l subclavian peudoanurysm s/p sternotomy
 oversew subclavian a  // eval ett, cvl placement     eval ett, cvl placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has had interim median sternotomy and cervicothoracic incision. 
 Mediastinal widening in the region of the aortic knob due to the ruptured left
 subclavian pseudoaneurysm is comparable to the preoperative appearance.  There
 is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal and
 unchanged.  New opacification in the left lower lung is presumably
 atelectasis.  Right lung is very low in volume but essentially clear.
 ET tube in standard placement.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary
 artery.
