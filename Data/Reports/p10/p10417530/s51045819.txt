                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two subsequent radiographs were obtained with the earliest radiograph showing
 an NG tube curling in the upper neck, and the subsequent radiograph showing no
 evidence of the tube. A single lead pacemaker is again seen, with the lead
 ending in the right ventricle a proper position. Otherwise there is no
 significant interval change in cardiomegaly. Decreased interstitial
 conspicuity suggests improvement in the fluid status of the patient. New right
 lung base opacities may represent atelectasis versus aspiration. A new small
 right-sided pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax.
 A single lead pacemaker is again seen, with the lead ending in the right
 ventricle a proper position.
 A single lead pacemaker is again seen, with the lead ending in the right
 ventricle a proper position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of NG tube in the last film obtained. New right lower lung
 opacities may represent atelectasis versus aspiration. New small right-sided
 pleural effusion. Stable cardiomegaly.
