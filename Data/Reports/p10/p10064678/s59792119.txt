                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cirrhosis, with shortness of breath
 and vomiting, question effusion or any other cause of shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  There are
 unchanged findings as compared with prior radiograph from three days ago with
 stable right pleural effusion with probable associated compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is a small left pleural effusion with subtle increase in
 left lower lobe consolidation, likely atelectasis.  Please note pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult to assess but
 appears grossly stable, but mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe consolidation is
 likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
