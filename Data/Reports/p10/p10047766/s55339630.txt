                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p AVR, CABG, evaluate effusions and
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the most recent prior study, lung volumes are improved and a
 moderate to large left pleural effusion is likely unchanged.  There is mild
 associated bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly, numerous
 mediastinal clips, and a prosthetic valve are unchanged.  The descending aorta
 is partially calcified and tortuous.  An IVC filter is partially imaged. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Mild
 biapical pleural thickening is similar.  Probable splenomegaly is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved lung volumes with a probably unchanged moderate to large left pleural
 effusion.
