 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recurrent pleural effusion, cholangio ca, ___
 days of exertional DOE and non-productive cough  // Evaluate for pneumonia,
 evaluate size of pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large left pleural effusion as well as subtly increased opacity
 throughout the right lung consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly displaced to the right however this finding may also
 reflect mild cardiac enlargement, possibly from a pericardial effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  No right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Large left pleural effusion
 2. Mild pulmonary edema seen primarily in the right lung.
 3. The heart appears minimally increased in size from the prior examination
 which may reflect a small pericardial effusion or rightward displacement from
 the large left pleural effusion.
