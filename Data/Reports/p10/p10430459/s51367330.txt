                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness, fatigue, and weight
 loss.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a ___.4 x 8.7 cm left perhilar mass.  For the most part its
 borders are fairly well-defined and smooth.  No additional mass lesions are
 seen.  The lungs and pleural spaces are otherwise clear without evidence of
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The heart is normal in size.  Mild
 degenerative change is seen throughout the thoracic spine with spurring. 
 There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left perihilar mass; differential diagnosis includes
 malignancy but smooth borders may indicate a cystic or benign lesion.  Chest
 CT, preferably with intravenous contrast, is recommended to characterize
 further.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 3:16 p.m. on
 ___ via telephone.
