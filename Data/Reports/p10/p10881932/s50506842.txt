                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is again evidence of
 mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, better seen on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph.  The lung parenchyma appears normal, without
 evidence of acute lung disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  The hilar and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.
