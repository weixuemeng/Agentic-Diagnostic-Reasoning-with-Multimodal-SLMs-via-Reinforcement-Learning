                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o seizures, who presents with new diffuse left sided
 SAH  s/p dural AVF embolization ___, s/p L crani/hematoma evac/EVD placement
 ___ w/ persistent neuro deficits.  // please evaluate for interval change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hemidiaphragm is persistently elevated.  There is a band of atelectasis
 crossing the chronically enlarged right hilus. Conventional radiographs are
 recommended when feasible to exclude the possibility of hilar mass, although I
 think an enlarged pulmonary artery is more likely. Previous mediastinal and
 pulmonary vasculature has cleared and heart has returned to normal size.
 Pleural effusions are small if any.
