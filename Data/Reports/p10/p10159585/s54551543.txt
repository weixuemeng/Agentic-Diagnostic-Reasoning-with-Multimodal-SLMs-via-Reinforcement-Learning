 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:12 PM
  
  1. Tip of the ETT in standard position. No pneumothorax.
  2. The side port of feeding tube is seen at the gastroesophageal junction and
  should be advanced by at least 3 cm for optimal positioning.
  3. Grossly unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small to moderate
  pleural effusions.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
  clinical setting.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 1:36 PM
  
  1. Tip of the ETT is seen and 5.1 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax.
  2. Grossly unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small to moderate
  pleural effusions.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
  clinical setting.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ ___ 1:49 PM
  
  1. Tip of the ETT is seen and 5.1 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax.
  2. The side port of feeding tube is seen close to the gastroesophageal
  junction and should be advanced by several cm.
  3. Grossly unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small to moderate
  pleural effusions.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 08:26, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient has been intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube seen 5.1 cm
 above the carina.  Bilateral predominantly perihilar alveolar opacities are
 again demonstrated, and are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities persists.  A feeding tube is visualized coursing
 through the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  A side
 port however is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  Small to
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions are similar.  The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  No pneumothorax.  Vascular calcifications are again seen in
 the bilateral axillary regions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tip of the ETT in standard position.  No pneumothorax.
 2. The side port of feeding tube is seen at the gastroesophageal junction and
 should be advanced by at least 3 cm for optimal positioning.
 3. Grossly unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral small to moderate
 pleural effusions.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
