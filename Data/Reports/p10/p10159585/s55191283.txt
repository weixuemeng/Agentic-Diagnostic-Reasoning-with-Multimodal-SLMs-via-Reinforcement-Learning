                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size has increased from the prior study, now appearing mildly enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Diffuse alveolar opacities with
 perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is most compatible with
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Addition a there is a moderate left and small right
 bilateral pleural effusions, new in the interval.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Vascular calcifications are in the region of both axilla.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of moderate congestive heart failure including moderate
 alveolar pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left
 and small on the right.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect compressive
 atelectasis however aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
