                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Clinical concern for partial small bowel obstruction in patient
 with prior proctocolectomy. Study performed to evaluate PICC line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC line terminates shortly above the cavoatrial junction. Lung
 volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 There are small pleural effusions with patchy retrocardiac opacity, most
 likely due to atelectasis. Streaky opacities in the right upper lung with mild
 crowding suggest chronic unchanged minor scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line terminating in the lower superior vena cava.
