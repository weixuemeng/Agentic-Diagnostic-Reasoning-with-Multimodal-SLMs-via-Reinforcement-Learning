                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Of note, the image timestamp ___ at 18:20 is correct.  The PACS
 timestamp of ___ at 13:05 is incorrect.
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, there is new
 right middle and lower lobe collapse with rightward shift of the mediastinum.
 There has also been interval placement of a tracheostomy, placement of a
 right-sided IJ central venous catheter which terminates the upper SVC, and
 removal of an enteric tube.    Moderate pulmonary edema has increased in
 severity, more apparent in the perihilar and basal left lung.  Pleural
 effusions small, if any. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum incompletely evaluated
 due to patient rotation ; attention on subsequent radiographs.  The right
 subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position within the lower
 SVC.  Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right middle and lower lobe collapse.  Increased, moderate  pulmonary
 edema.  Interval placement of a tracheostomy without pneumothorax or other
 obvious acute complications.  New, right-sided IJ central venous catheter
 terminates the upper SVC.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 03:41 PM, approximately 60
