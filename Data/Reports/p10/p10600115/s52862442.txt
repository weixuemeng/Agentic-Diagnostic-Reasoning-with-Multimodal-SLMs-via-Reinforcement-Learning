                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M presenting as transfer from ___ s/p 2 story fall sustaining
 C1/C6 fractures and mesenteric perforation with course c/b septic/hypovolemic
 shock, acute renal failure requiring HD, and cardiac arrest x2 on transport to
 ___ now with no spontaneous movement off sedation, with tracheostomy  //
 ?interval change   ?interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and possible
 small effusion.  There is continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure,
 though this appears less prominent than on the prior examination.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 There is a catheter or wire projected over the left axillary region, with the
 tip well outside the thoracic cage, of uncertain etiology.
