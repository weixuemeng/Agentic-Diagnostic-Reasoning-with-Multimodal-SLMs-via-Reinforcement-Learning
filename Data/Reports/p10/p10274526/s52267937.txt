                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Right axillary lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 There is moderate enlargement of both hila, left greater than right as well as
 lobulation to mediastinal contours lateral to the pulmonary outflow tract and
 extending into the aortopulmonic window consistent with central adenopathy. 
 It could be tiny granulomatous calcifications in the lungs or these might be
 vessels on end.  There are no nodules large enough to raise concern for
 malignancy.  Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion. 
 Differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis as well as other causes of
 adenopathy, dependent upon clinical circumstances, which could include
 lymphoma or disseminated malignancy.
