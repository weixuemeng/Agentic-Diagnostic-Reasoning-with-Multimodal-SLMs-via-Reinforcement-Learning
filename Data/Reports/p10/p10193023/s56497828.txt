                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath
 x 3 days
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity projecting over the right mid lung field corresponds to congenital
 fusion of the right-sided ribs, unchanged. Lung volumes are low which
 accentuate the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted without pulmonary edema. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Remote left-sided
 rib fractures are re- demonstrated. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
 is again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
