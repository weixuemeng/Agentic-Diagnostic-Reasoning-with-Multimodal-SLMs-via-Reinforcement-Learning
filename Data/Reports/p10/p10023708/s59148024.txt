 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ovarian carcinoma, on chemotherapy, now
 with weakness, nausea, vomiting.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show a ___-mm left lower lobe opacity, which is
 new.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  A moderate hiatal hernia is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ___-mm nodular opacity in the left lower lobe warrants further examination with
