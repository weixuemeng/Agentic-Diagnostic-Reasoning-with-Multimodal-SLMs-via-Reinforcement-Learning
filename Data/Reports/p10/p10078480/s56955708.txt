                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with confusion  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Given differences in positioning and technique, there has been no significant
 interval change. Bibasilar opacities are most likely due to superimposed soft
 tissue structures and overlying material. Superiorly the lungs are clear. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Leftward deviation of the trachea at
 the thoracic inlet is suggestive of underlying right-sided thyroid
 enlargement. Calcification suggesting intra-articular bodies project over the
 glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Leftward deviation of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet as on prior suggestive right thyroid enlargement which can be
 further assessed by dedicated thyroid ultrasound.
