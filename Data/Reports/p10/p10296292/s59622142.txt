                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMH of IVDU, Hep C, and prior endocarditis is
 transferred from ___ for evaluation by Hand Surgery after
 presenting there for left arm cellulitis, subsequently determined to warrant a
 work-up to rule out endocarditis.  // Septic emboli?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear EXCEPT FOR A QUESTIONABLE
 SUBCENTIMETER NODULAR OPACITY IN THE PERIPHERY OF THE LEFT UPPER LUNG BETWEEN
 THE SECOND AND THIRD ANTERIOR RIBS, PARTIALLY OBSCURED BY THE OVERLYING
 SCAPULAR MARGIN.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Questionable sub cm left upper lobe nodular opacity, most likely due to
 superimposition of normal structures.  Repeat radiograph with repositioning of
 the scapula would be helpful to better evaluate this region, particularly
 considering clinical suspicion for septic emboli.
