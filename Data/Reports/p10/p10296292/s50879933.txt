                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMH of IVDU, Hep C, and prior endocarditis was
 transferred from ___ with LUE DVT,  subsequently determined to
 warrant an endocarditis workup given recent bacteremia and probable septic
 thrombophlebitis in LUE.  // Questionable sub cm left upper lobe nodular
 opacity on CXR yesterday likely due to superimposition of normal structures.
 Repeat radiograph with repositioning of the scapula to assess for presence of
 septic emboli
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the nodular structure projecting over
 the right lung apex, described on location of the chest x-ray performed
 yesterday, is no longer visualized.  On today's image, no abnormalities are
 noted, in particular there is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
