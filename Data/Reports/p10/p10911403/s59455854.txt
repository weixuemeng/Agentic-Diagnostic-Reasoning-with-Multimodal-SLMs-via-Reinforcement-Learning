                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.1 cm from the carina. Heart
 size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Patchy opacity within the left lung base likely
 reflects an area of atelectasis, somewhat improved compared to the prior
 study.  Tubular radiopaque density projecting over the heart size may be
 external to the patient. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis, slightly improved in the interval.
