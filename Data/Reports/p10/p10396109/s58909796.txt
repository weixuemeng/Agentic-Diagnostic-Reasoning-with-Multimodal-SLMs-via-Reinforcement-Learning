                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pressure.  Question etiology.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate severe right
 convex lower thoracic scoliosis.  Allowing for such, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  A slightly more
 discrete focal density projecting over the right lower lung on frontal view
 without correlate on lateral view could potentially represent the nipple
 shadow, but a discrete lesion is not excluded.  Recommend repeat PA view with
 nipple markers in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process to account for presentation.
 
 2.  Marked right convex lower thoracic scoliosis.
 
 3.  A small rounded density overlying the right lower lung could represent a
 nipple shadow versus a discrete lesion.  Recommend repeat PA radiograph with
 nipple markers.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ by phone at 3:30 p.m. on ___.
