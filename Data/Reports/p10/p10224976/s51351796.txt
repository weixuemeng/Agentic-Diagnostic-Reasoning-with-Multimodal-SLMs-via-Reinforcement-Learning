                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and tachycardia and history of
 osteosarcoma.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from the same
 date.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior chest radiograph and chest CTA, there is an
 apparent increase in opacification of the left lower lobe and associated small
 pleural effusion.  The right basilar opacity is not significantly changed from
 prior and is known to represent metastatic disease.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The Port-A-Cath
 catheter ends in the right atrium in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left basilar opacity with associated small pleural effusion
 may represent pneumonia.  Right basilar consolidation is known to represent
 metastatic disease and is unchanged from prior.
