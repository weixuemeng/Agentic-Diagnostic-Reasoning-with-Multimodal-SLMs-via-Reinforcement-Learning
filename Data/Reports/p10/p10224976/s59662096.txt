 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:50 PM
  1. Increased moderate to large sized left pleural effusion. 
  
  2. Worsened right basal opacities which likely reflects a combination of
  pleural effusion and consolidation. Increased ill-defined opacity in the right
  lower lung could reflect worsened metastatic disease. Rounded opacity in the
  right perihilar region is compatible with known loculated fissural fluid as
  seen on prior chest CT.   However, underlying infectious processes cannot be
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, recent pneumonia.  Evaluate for pneumonia, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS: A right-sided double barrel Port-A-Cath catheter terminates in the
 cavoatrial junction. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is increased moderate to large left-sided pleural effusion. Right
 basal opacities have worsened and likely reflect a combination of pleural
 effusion and consolidation. Increased ill-defined opacity in the right lower
 lung could reflect worsened metastatic disease. Rounded opacity in the right
 perihilar region is compatible with known loculated fissural fluid, as seen on
 prior chest CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  Evaluation of the cardiac
 silhouette is somewhat limited, however the cardiomediastinal contour appears
 grossly stable when compared to prior examination. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased moderate to large sized left pleural effusion.  
 
 2. Worsened right basal opacities which likely reflect a combination of
 pleural effusion and consolidation. Increased ill-defined opacity in the right
 lower lung could reflect worsened metastatic disease. Rounded opacity in the
 right perihilar region is compatible with known loculated fissural fluid.  
 However, underlying infectious processes cannot be excluded.
