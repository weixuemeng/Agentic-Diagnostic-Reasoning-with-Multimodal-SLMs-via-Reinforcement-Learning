                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malignant right pleural effusion from osteosarcoma.  The patient
 has undergone pleurodesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest, ___.  Chest radiographs, ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Two right pleural drains are in
 stable position.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in the right atrium. 
 Irregular thickening of the costal pleural margins on the right is unchanged. 
 Consolidation of the right lung could be due to pleurodesis/atelectasis. 
 There may be a tiny apical pneumothorax.  The heart still appears mildly
 enlarged.  Right hilar opacity likely represents a large area of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Stable right costal pleural thickening from pleurodesis.
 2.  Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax.
