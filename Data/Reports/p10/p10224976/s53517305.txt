                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Febrile neutropenia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There has been interval
 improvement in aeration of the left lung base.  A small left pleural effusion
 is likely present.  Persistent partially loculated small to moderate right
 pleural effusion is unchanged with adjacent right basilar opacity likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the left lung base.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, relatively unchanged.  Right basilar
 opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
