                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic osteosarcoma with malignant right pleural effusion. 
 Patient has undergone talc pleurodesis.  Pleural drains removed, but now
 experiencing left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Port-A-Cath is in stable position. 
 The two right pleural drains have been removed.  Small right apical
 pneumothorax noted on CT is not visible.  Round opacity at the right hilum
 represents loculation of pleural fluid in the major fissure.  Irregular
 pleural thickening is stable.  Aside from basilar atelectasis, the left lung
 is clear.  There is no pneumothorax on this side.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax on the left, but further evaluation with PA and lateral
 views would be helpful to evaluate left-sided chest pain.
 2.  Small right apical pneumothorax seen on CT is not visible.
 3.  Stable pleural thickening and loculations from talc pleurodesis on the
 right.
