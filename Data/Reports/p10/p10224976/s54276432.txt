                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 848
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic osteosarcoma and known PEs and
 effusion status post pigtail catheter placement, question worsening effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 208.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 848 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left pigtail catheter remains in place.  There is a layering right
 effusion with bilateral airspace process, right greater than left, which is
 not significantly changed since ___.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains
 unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax.  Apparent biapical pleural opacity
 most likely reflects mild pleural thickening related to projectional changes
 between studies, although loculated pleural fluid would also be in the
 differential.
