                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT head and neck ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine frontal view of the chest.  The lung volumes are
 very low.  There is diffuse airspace opacity in the right lung.  Bilateral
 interstitial prominence likely represents mild pulmonary edema. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is accentuated due to
 low lung volumes, but is probably normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Diffuse airspace opacities in the right lung could represent aspiration,
 infection or less likely hemorrhage.
 
 2.  Mild edema is most likely present.
