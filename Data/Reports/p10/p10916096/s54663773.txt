                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with history of splenectomy, chronic pancreatitis, whipple,
 and pleural effusions presents with acute onset fever and dyspnea.  //
 Evaluate for consolidation vs pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacity at the right lung base is most compatible with scarring.  There
 is a left basilar opacity partially silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Some of
 this may also be due to atelectasis and scarring although underlying effusion
 would be possible as well.  Superiorly, lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Old healed right
 posterior rib fractures are noted.  Left upper quadrant coils are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity likely in part due to atelectasis though superimposed
 effusion is also possible.
