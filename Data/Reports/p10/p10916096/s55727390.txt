                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of chronic pancreatitis complaining of
 rib tightness that feels similar to when he had pleural effusion in past
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated with areas of
 scarring noted in both lung bases.  Blunting of the costophrenic sulci
 bilaterally likely reflects chronic pleural thickening rather than pleural
 effusions.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again noted.  Coils
 are seen within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
