 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea  // evaluate for pulmonary congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes again noted.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular
 markings likely due to in part low lung volumes and overlying subcutaneous

 no large pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable pulmonary vascular congestion without obvious consolidation based on
 this limited portable exam.
