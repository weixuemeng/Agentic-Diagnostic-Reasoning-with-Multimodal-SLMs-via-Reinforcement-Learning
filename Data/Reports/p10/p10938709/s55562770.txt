  Compared to CTA of the chest ___ at 03:56 there is worsening opacity
  throughout the right lung which may reflect aspiration, hemorrhage or
  asymmetric pulmonary edema superimposed on numerous pulmonary nodules. The
  heart is severely enlarged. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may
  reflect small pleural effusion. There are multiple pulmonary nodules in the
  left upper lung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pectoral hematoma now with hypoxia  //
 evaluate for pulmonary edema      evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the CT angiogram, there is worsening opacity throughout the
 right lung, which may reflect aspiration, hemorrhage, or asymmetric pulmonary
 edema superimposed on numerous pulmonary nodules. Severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is seen. Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the left is
 consistent with pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Multiple pulmonary
 nodules are seen in the left upper lung.
