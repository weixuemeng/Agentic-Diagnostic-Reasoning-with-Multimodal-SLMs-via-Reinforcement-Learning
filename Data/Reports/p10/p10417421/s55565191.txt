                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis, hypoxemia, possible bibasilar pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT earlier this morning from another institution, abdomen
 and pelvis CT earlier this morning from another institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities correlate with the findings seen on the recent CT.  There is no
 consolidation in the upper lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  The central
 pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, but there is no evidence of overt
 edema.  There are no abnormal cardiac or cardiomediastinal contours.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous. No signficant pleural effusions is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar airspace opacities may represent infection or
 aspiration.  Findings are similar to the recent CT.
