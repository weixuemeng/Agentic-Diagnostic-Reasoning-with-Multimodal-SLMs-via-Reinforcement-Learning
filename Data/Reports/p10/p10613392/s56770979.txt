                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal scarring is noted within
 the lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.  Anterior
 cervical fusion hardware is not well assessed on these views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Hyperinflated lungs may suggest underlying
 COPD.
