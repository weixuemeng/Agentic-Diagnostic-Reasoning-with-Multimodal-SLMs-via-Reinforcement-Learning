 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There are increased interstitial markings diffusely, with small
 amount of fluid noted within the fissures.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view is also noted compatible with a trace
 left pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Mild diffuse interstitial abnormality suggestive of an atypical infectious
 process with a trace left pleural effusion.
