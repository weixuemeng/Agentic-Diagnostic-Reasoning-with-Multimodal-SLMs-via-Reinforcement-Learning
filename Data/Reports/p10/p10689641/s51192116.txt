                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and tenderness to palpation. 
 Evaluate for fracture, pneumothorax, or other cause for chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are within normal limits.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  If rib fractures continue to be a clinical
 concern, then dedicated rib series with markers marking the site of pain may
 help for further assessment.
