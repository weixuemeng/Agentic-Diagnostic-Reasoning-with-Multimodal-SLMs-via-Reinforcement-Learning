                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral rales, to assess for congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 slightly more prominent, though this may reflect slightly lower inspiration. 
 There is also some mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels in the hilar
 region.  This could reflect minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure,
 though the vessels at the periphery are entirely within normal limits and
 there is no evidence of Kerley lines to suggest vascular congestion.
