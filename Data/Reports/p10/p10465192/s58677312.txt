                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, transplant  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Local lung volumes are noted, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures but there may be mild interstitial abnormality in the lung bases,
 including the mild edema. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated relative to the
 left.  Unfortunately we have no prior chest radiographs so the chronicity is
 indeterminate. Streaky bibasilar atelectasis is more significant on the right.
 There is no evidence of lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality, could be acute edema, alternatively
 interstitial pneumonia, or chronic lung disease.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 8:18 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
