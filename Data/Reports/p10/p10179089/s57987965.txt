                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Cough for three weeks, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with minimal
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.  No focal parenchymal
 opacity suggesting pneumonia.  However, a zone of minimally increased
 radiodensity is seen adjacent to the right chest wall, with one nodular
 component in the opacity projecting over the scapula.  This area should be
 worked up with CT to exclude a potential neoplastic process.
 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 7:56 a.m., on ___, this
 finding was added to the radiology dashboard.
