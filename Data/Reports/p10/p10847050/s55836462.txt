  Hyperinflated lungs suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without

  5 mm rounded nodular opacity at the right lung base could represent a vessel

 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with malaise, weakness  // ? acute cardiopulm
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Costochondral calcifications are seen bilaterally without definite
 focal consolidation.  5 mm rounded nodular opacity at the right lung base
 could represent a vessel on end, but pulmonary nodules not excluded.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without
 definite focal consolidation.
 
 5 mm rounded nodular opacity at the right lung base could represent a vessel
 on end, but pulmonary nodules not excluded.  Recommend a follow-up nonemergent
 chest CT for further assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Non emergent chest CT.
