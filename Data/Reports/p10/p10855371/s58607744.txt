  1. No acute sequelae of trauma.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Linear radiodensity within the IVC most consistent with a lower extremity
  PICC line extending 5 cm beyond the RA/IVC junction. However, by report
  patient has no central access. This finding is of uncertain etiology but
  doubtful immediate clinical significance.  Correlate with history of
  instrumentation or prior imaging of the abdomen/pelvis, if either can be
  obtained.
