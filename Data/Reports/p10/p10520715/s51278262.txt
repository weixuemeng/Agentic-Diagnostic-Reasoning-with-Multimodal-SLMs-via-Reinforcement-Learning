 pneumonia      ?evaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged with some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels that could reflect mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. No
 evidence of pleural effusion.  Mild asymmetry of opacification at the bases,
 more prominent on the right, could possibly reflect a developing consolidation
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
