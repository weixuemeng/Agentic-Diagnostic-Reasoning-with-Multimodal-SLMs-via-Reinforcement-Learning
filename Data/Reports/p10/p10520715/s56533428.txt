 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen right upper lobe pneumonia has resolved.  Heart size is
 enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is ingested.  There is mild interstitial
 edema but no large pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification likely
 represents atelectasis, however early infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate vascular congestion of mild interstitial edema.
 Retrocardiac opacification likely reflective atelectasis, however early
 infection cannot be excluded.
