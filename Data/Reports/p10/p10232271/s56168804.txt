  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Focal nodular opacity projecting over the
  left lower lung, potentially superimposed shadows but dedicated shallow
  oblique images suggested to re-evaluate for possibility of underlying nodule.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with possible seizure  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a focal nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung.  While
 this may represent superimposed shadows, as no definite correlate is seen on
 the lateral view, underlying pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Focal nodular opacity projecting over the
 left lower lung, potentially superimposed shadows but dedicated shallow
 oblique images suggested to re-evaluate.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Repeat chest x-ray with shallow obliques to further assess
 for possible pulmonary nodule.
