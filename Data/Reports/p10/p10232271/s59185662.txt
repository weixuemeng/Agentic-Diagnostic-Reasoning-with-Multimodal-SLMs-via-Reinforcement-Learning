                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxic respiratory failure  // ?
 esophageal balloon placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:02.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip 3.4 cm above the carina.  2 NG type tubes are seen,
 both extending beneath the diaphragm off the film.  1 has a side-port, which
 lies just beneath the diaphragm.  No air-filled balloon is identified along
 the expected course of the esophagus.
 
 A curvilinear rim of air is seen along the inner aspect of the right upper
 lung.  Based on comparison to the prior film, this likely represents air
 within the trachea projecting over the right lung due to  patient rotation. 
 If there is specific concern for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum than in AP
 view with better visualization of the lung apices and upper mediastinum could
 be obtained.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar allowing for differences in
 positioning, with probable cardiomegaly Again seen are opacities over the mid
 and lower zones of both lungs, compatible with layering pleural effusions and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Note is made of air bronchograms in
 the right-greater-than-left mid zones, compatible with pulmonary
 consolidation.
 
 Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Curvilinear lucency along the left upper lung question tear within the trachea
 projecting there due to rotation.  If there is specific concern for
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum than in AP view with better visualization of
 the lung apices and upper mediastinum could be obtained.
 
  Bilateral consolidation and effusions again noted, similar to prior.
