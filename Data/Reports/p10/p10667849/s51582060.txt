                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Assess for fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs appear
 clear.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Retrocardiac opacity with an air-fluid level is compatible with a hiatal
 hernia.  Heart and mediastinal contours appear normal.  Slight deformity of
 the right eighth and ninth posterior ribs could represent minimally displaced
 fractures.  Please correlate for focal pain in this region.  Otherwise, no
 definite osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right eighth and ninth posterior rib fractures. 
 Correlate for acuity.  Retrocardiac opacity compatible with hiatal hernia.
