                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and sputum production.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance including prominence of
 the main pulmonary artery, most likely related to pulmonary hypertension. 
 There is overall indistinct contours of the upper mediastinum on the right as
 well.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 Reevaluation of the patient with PA and lateral view would be beneficial to
 exclude the possibility of mediastinal abnormality.
