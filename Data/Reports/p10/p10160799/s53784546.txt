                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The lung
 volumes are slightly low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 Ill-defined opacities thought to be in the lingula, but best seen on the
 lateral projection, are likely atelectasis, although an infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lingular atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
 2.  Low lung volumes.
