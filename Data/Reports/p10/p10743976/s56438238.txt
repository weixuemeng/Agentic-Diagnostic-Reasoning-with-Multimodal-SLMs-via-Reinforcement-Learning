  Focal density seen on the lateral radiograph could represent small pleural
  effusion, subsegmental atelectasis, or early consolidation.  Right lateral
  decubitus radiographs are recommended to evaluate for layering fluid.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A focal density overlying the spine on the lateral radiograph could represent
 a small pleural effusion, subsegmental atelectasis, or early consolidation,
 likely in the medial right base. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The previously
 described large, peripherally-calcified splenic cyst appears grossly similar
 to prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal density seen on the lateral radiograph could represent small pleural
 effusion, subsegmental atelectasis, or early consolidation.  Right lateral
 decubitus radiographs are recommended to evaluate for layering fluid.
