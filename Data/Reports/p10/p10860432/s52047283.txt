                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for the presence of congestive heart failure in a
 patient with chronic myelofibrosis and new lower extremity edema.  The patient
 has a history of multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  Multiple prior radiographs dating as far back as ___ are reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate multifocal
 airspace opacities, predominantly in the right middle, right lower, and left
 lower lung fields.  Because the patient has had a significant prior pathology
 at these locations, it is assumed that these represent chronic scarring or
 inflammatory changes.  However, if the patient has experienced infectious
 symptoms, new multifocal pneumonia with a similar distribution cannot be
 excluded.
 
 The heart size is normal, and there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement, nor
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
 2.  Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities in the middle and lower lung zones
 likely represent chronic scarring; however, acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded if there are other clinical indications of pneumonia.
