                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with increased shortness of breath,
 evaluate for CHF or infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination ___ ___.
 
 The heart is enlarged.  The configuration suggests a prominence of the left
 ventricular contour, but an additional enlargement of the left atrium is noted
 in the form of a typical double contour in the right heart shadow.  Thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated but does not show any local contour
 abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone
 redistribution pattern and there exists small amounts of bilateral pleural
 effusions in the posterior pleural sinuses as well as mostly on the right
 pleural sinus.  Comparison is made with the next preceding examination.  The,
 at that time observed pulmonary abnormalities believed to be chronic and
 possibly representing scar formations are again noted.  There is however a new
 area of diffuse parenchymal density on the left lung base partially in
 retrocardiac location that appears to be new and represents possibly a
 pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 It is observed that on the preceding chest examination cardiac enlargement
 existed already as well as the upper zone redistribution pattern in the
 pulmonary circulation.  The present examination shows however diffuse
 increased perivascular haze.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF as well as new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates on the left
 base suspicious for pneumonic infection.  Followup examination is recommended.
