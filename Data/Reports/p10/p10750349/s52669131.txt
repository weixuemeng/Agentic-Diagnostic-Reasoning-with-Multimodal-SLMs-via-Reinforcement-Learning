                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Probable RCC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly with
 increased interstitial opacities that correspond to subpleural reticular
 markings on concurrent CT chest.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Given recent CT chest,
 this is unlikely to be pulmonary edema.
