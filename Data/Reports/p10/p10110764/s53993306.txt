  Dobbhoff terminates in stomach.  Bilateral pleural effusions and cardiomegaly
  have likely minimally improved but changes may be due to more upright
  positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Bilateral
 opacities consistent with large effusions and adjacent atelectasis have
 minimally improved, but this is most likely due to difference in positioning
 of the patient.  No evident pneumothorax.
