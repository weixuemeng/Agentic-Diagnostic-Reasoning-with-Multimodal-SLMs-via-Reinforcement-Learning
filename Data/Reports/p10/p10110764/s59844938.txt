                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:53
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post colonic resection, intubated,
 with ARDS, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 4:53 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube with its tip at thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube
 coursing below the diaphragm, with the tip and side port likely within the
 proximal stomach, unchanged.  A left subclavian central line with its tip in
 the proximal SVC.  Bilateral layering effusions with persistent retrocardiac
 consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe collapse, although
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  The pulmonary vasculature remains
 somewhat prominent but no definite pulmonary edema is appreciated.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax, although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
