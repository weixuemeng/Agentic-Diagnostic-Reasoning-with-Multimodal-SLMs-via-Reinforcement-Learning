 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
 in unchanged position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There are layering bilateral effusions with associated patchy opacities at
 both bases suggestive of patchy atelectasis, although a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  No large pneumothoraces.  The mediastinal contours are stable. 
 Overall, there has been no significant interval change.
