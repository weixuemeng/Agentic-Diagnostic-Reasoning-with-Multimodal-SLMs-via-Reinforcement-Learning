                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions,
 larger on the left, are slightly decreased in size compared to the prior exam.
 Streaky opacity in the right lung base and a more focal consolidative opacity
 in the left lung base likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  Calcified granuloma in the right mid
 lung field is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, minimally improved compared to the previous
 exam with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.
