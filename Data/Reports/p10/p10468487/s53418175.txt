                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and hypoxia. Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which has resulted in bibasilar patchy atelectasis.
 Apparent parenchymal abnormalities are artificially increased by the presence
 of pleural calcifications. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged. Prominence of the mediastinum is
 exacerbated by low lung volumes. Hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
