                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dCHF, restrictive lung disease, worsening
 dyspnea  // eval for pulm edema, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with 1 day prior, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen an aortic replacement device in relation to the ascending aorta.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar.  Possibility of slight volume
 loss on the left cannot be excluded, similar to prior.  There are bilateral
 effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, consistent with CHF, also overall similar
 to the prior film.  The possibility of underlying parenchymal scarring cannot
 be excluded.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there may be some increased opacity in both lung
 apices, though there is also more lordotic positioning on the current film.
 
 3 drains, tapes or other devices overlie the upper chest.  Clips again noted
 in the region of the GE junction.
 
 Left-sided PICC line lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible new opacities in the bilateral apices.  This may be related to CHF
 or, less likely, new areas of aspiration/infectious infiltrate. If related to
 CHF, that it represents a slight increase in CHF compared to the prior film.
 
 Otherwise, overall similar to 1 day prior.
