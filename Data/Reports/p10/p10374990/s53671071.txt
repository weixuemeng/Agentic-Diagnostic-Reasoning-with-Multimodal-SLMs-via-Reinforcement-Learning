                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a
 lesser inspiratory effort.  As a consequence, the lung parenchyma is slightly
 denser at the lung bases and the lung volumes have decreased.  In unchanged
 manner, apical fibrosis is seen, but no parenchymal opacities have newly
 appeared.  No evidence of pneumonia.
