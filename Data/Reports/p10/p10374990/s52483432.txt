                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o Hodgkins and mantle radiation
 resulting in aortic stenosis, now s/p TAVR on ___ // location of temp pacer
 wire?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable prominent
 interstitial markings bilaterally without any focal consolidation or
 superimposed edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 The left-sided PICC line ends at the approximate level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  The temporary pacing wire projects over the right atrium, headed
 towards the right ventricle. No pneumothorax. Opacity projecting over the
 expected location of the right renal shadow likely represents contrast in the
 right renal collecting system.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Temporary pacing wire projects over the right atrium, headed towards the right
 ventricle. If exact location is needed, a lateral view would be helpful if
 patient is able.
