                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R chylothorax s/p chest tube placement. 
 // Please evaluate for interval change in chylothorax, chest tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place with persistent small to
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Right apical pneumothorax is difficult to
 exclude due to partial obscuration of this region by the flexed position of
 the neck.  With the exception of limited visualization of this region, there
 is otherwise no relevant change from the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier.
