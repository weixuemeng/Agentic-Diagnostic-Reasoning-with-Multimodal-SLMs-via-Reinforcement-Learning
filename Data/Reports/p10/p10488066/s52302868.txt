                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with acute agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is predominately linear opacity in the right mid and left lower lung
 which may represent atelectasis versus scarring.  In the absence of prior
 studies, the possibility of a subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No convincing signs of edema all for
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within
 normal limits.  The imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable atelectasis versus scarring in the right mid and left lower lung.  In
 the absence of prior imaging studies, difficult to exclude a subtle underlying
 pneumonia.  Please correlate clinically.
