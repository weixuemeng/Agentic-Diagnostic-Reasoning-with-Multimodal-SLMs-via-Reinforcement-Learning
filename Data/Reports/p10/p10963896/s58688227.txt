                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of ulcerative colitis, presenting clinically with
 pancreatitis.  Evaluate for evidence of effusions or signs of adult
 respiratory distress syndrome.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, limiting assessment for mild vascular congestion secondary to
 crowding of the bronchovasculature.  The lungs are clear.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Note is made of an azygos lobe,
 a normal anatomic variant.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
