                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of myocardial infarction with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is normal.  Fullness of the hilar contours is unchanged
 compared to the previous exam.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, which could reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific but may reflect
 atelectasis.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
