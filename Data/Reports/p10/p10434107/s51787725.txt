                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  This
 accentuates the size of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, the heart
 size is likely mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There
 is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Streaky opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes are also noted in the
 left glenohumeral joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which limits assessment of the lung bases. 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
