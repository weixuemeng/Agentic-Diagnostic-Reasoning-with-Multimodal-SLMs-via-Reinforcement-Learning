                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of hemorrhagic stroke with seizure,
 now with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Previously seen enteric tube is
 no longer visualized.  Relatively low lung volumes are again noted.  Left
 greater than right bibasilar opacities are seen, which persists on the
 lateral, which could be due to atelectasis; however, infection or aspiration
 would be difficult to exclude.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, atherosclerotic calcifications
 again noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis given low
 lung volumes, noting that infection or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.
