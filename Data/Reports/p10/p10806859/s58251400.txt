                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoking history with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta in a
 patient who has undergone previous CABG procedure with intact midline sternal
 wires.  Pulmonary vessels are within normal limits.  The discordancy raises
 the possibility of cardiomyopathy.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia.
