 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:07 AM
  Mistake in recent prior wet read, which was intended for different patient. 
  Chest radiographs show a left basilar opacity, pneumonia versus atelectasis. 
 WET READ VERSION #1 
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 9:02 AM
  Obstruction of afferent limb of Roux-en-Y including dilatation of duodenum to
  nearly 7 cm, functionally a closed loop obstruction.  Fatty infiltration of
  the liver.  Increased left adnexal cystic lesion; recommended follow-up
  ultrasound when appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is a
 streaky left basilar opacity, which is concerning for pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  However, a similar appearance could probably be
 seen with atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar retrocardiac opacity, which could be seen with
 pneumonia, although considerations would also include atelectasis.
