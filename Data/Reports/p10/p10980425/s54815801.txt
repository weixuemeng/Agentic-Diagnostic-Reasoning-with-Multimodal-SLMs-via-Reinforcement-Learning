 unchanged.  Clips project over the left lateral apex, also unchanged.
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No focal consolidation, edema,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is
 not widened.  Aortic knob calcifications are mild.  Detailed evaluation of the
