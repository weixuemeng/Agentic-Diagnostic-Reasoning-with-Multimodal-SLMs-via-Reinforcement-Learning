                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall after generalized weakness today.  //
 ?infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures at
 the lung bases.  Within this context, patchy and linear bibasilar opacities
 may potentially represent atelectasis, particularly as these findings are less
 prominent on the lateral view, obtained at a greater degree of inspiration. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable since the prior examination.  There
 is central pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Considering clinical concern for infection,
 repeat frontal radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful to
 exclude an early infectious basilar pneumonia.
