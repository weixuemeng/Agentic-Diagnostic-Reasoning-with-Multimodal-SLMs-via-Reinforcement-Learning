                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with consolidation seen on
 the prior chest radiograph.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 On the lateral view, there is opacity seen posteriorly that might potentially
 represent small amount of pleural effusion, pleural lesion or small Bochdalek
 hernia.  Given the lack of prior imaging, correlation with chest CT is
 recommended.
 
 Also, there is a nodule projecting over the left upper lobe location, 5-mm as
 well as questionable nodule projecting over the right upper lobe, 8 mm that
 could also assessed on the subsequent chest CT.
