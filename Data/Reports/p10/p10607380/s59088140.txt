                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  altered mental status// Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries again noted suggestive underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multiple
 right axillary clips are re- demonstrated.  Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous
 structures is compatible with widespread metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Widespread osseous metastases.
