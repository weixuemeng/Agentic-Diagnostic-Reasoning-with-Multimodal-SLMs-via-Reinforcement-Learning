 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:09 AM
  Limited study. there is marked deformity of the bony structures compatible
  with osteogenesis imperfecta.  There is severe scoliosis. Minimal vascular
  engorgment compared to ___ may represent limited technique rather
  than true pul edema. Constrast and air filled loops of large and small bowel.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress in a patient with history of
 osteogenesis imperfecta, suspected pulmonary edema.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 and CT torso from ___.
 
 The current study demonstrates substantially distended stomach, new finding
 since the prior study.  The stomach contributes to slight elevation of the
 hemidiaphragm.  As compared to prior study, there is new right perihilar
 opacity that potentially might reflect interval development of pulmonary
 edema.  Left lung cannot be assessed due to patient habitus.  Contrast
 material within the bowel is due to recent administration for assessment of
 the abdominal structures.  Extensive bone deformities are consistent with
 known osteogenesis imperfecta.
