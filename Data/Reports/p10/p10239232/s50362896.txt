                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal. The central pulmonary vasculature is engorged,
 without overt edema.  Bibasilar linear type opacities, worse at the left, are
 most compatible with atelectasis, though small underlying consolidation cannot
 be entirely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild
 degenerate changes throughout the thoracic spine are unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the left.  A small underlying
 consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion, without overt edema. Top-normal
 heart size.
