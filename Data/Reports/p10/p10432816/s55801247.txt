                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  Subsequent to initial interpretation of this study, prior chest
 radiographs have been provided, showing no change since ___ in the
 appearance of the mildly expanded sclerotic right first anterior rib and
 adjacent sternum, accounting for opacification in the right apex.  The study
 does not require augmentation with a lordotic view for any further
 clarification.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a recent pneumonia.  Evaluate for residual
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available at this time.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate well expanded lungs. 
 There is asymmetry of the lung apices, with greater opacity seen on the right,
 seeming to conform to the right 1st rib.  This may represent old rib deformity
 versus residual disease in the setting of recent right upper lobe pneumonia. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Asymmetry of the lung apices, with greater opacity seen on the right, seeming
 to conform to the right 1st rib.  Consider an apical lordotic view to exclude
 lesion in the lung or comparison to recent outside chest CT, should it become
 available.
 
 COMMENTS:  These findings were discussed with Dr.___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 5:20pm on ___, 45 minutes after their discovery.
