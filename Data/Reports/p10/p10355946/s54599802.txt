                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and body aches.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is micro-nodularity of the lung parenchyma, stable in
 comparison to prior study and possibly representing patient's underlying
 sarcoid.  There is now an increased rounded opacity at the right hilum which
 raises suspicion for increased right hilar adenopathy. Otherwise, the lungs
 are clear and without a focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears at the upper limits of normal.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right hilar opacity raises suspicion for increased
 right hilar adenopathy in this patient with Sarcoid. Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
