                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HIV, cough.  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph obscuration of the right heart border which on
 the lateral radiograph corresponds to a linear opacity.  This appears to have
 been present on examination dated ___, may be post
 infectious/inflammatory in etiology or atelectasis, slightly more conspicuous.
 Retrocardiac is slightly more conspicuous relative to prior study, may reflect
 a small hiatal hernia or confluence of shadows.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe linear opacity appears to have been present on prior
 examinations, slightly more conspicuous, may reflect atelectasis or post
 inflammatory/infectious changes.  An acute process is difficult to exclude.
