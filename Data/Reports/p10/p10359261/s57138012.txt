 otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from previous imaging.  A
 right-sided dialysis catheter is again seen with the tip projecting over the
 cavoatrial junction.  Mild hyperinflation is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight opacity above the minor fissure which could be a
 developing consolidation, however it is not visualized on lateral exam.
