 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:23 PM
  left basilar opacity appears similar to ___ but right medial basilar
  opacity is new with Kerly B lines suggesting mild-moderate pulmonary edema
  although aspiration is also a possiblity. there may be a small left pleural
  effusion. cardiac silhouette is obscured.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Subdural hematoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is persistent leftward shift of mediastinal structures, possibly with
 some volume loss in the left lung and similar patchy mid lung opacification. 
 A calcified pleural plaque is also noted in the left hemithorax.  Widespread
 opacification of the right mid-to-lower lung is new including interstitial
 changes including Kerley B lines identifiable at the right lung base.  Small
 pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.   Rightward convex spinal
 curvature is similar.
  
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  If that
 interpretation is compatible with clinical findings then repeat radiographs
 are suggested after treatment in order to assess whether an additional
 pulmonary process such as aspiration or pneumonia may potentially coincide.
