                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New OG tube placement.  Please confirm positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube is seen below the diaphragmwith tip in at least
 distal stomach..  A left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter with
 tip tip in the upper upper superior vena cava.  Right-sided internal jugular
 venous catheter with tip likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic
 veins.  Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  There has been interval
 minimal decreased in size of the right pleural effusion, now moderate in size
 with overall improved aeration of the right lung base.  Large left effusion is
 probably stable in size, though assessment difficult given increased
 retrocardiac opacification, likely due to worsened collapse.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Well-positioned nasogastric tube.  Minimally improved right pleural effusion
 now small in size.  Stable large left pleural effusion. Increased left lower
 lobe collapse.
