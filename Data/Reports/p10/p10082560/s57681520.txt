                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with abdominal pain, coughing phlegm and vomiting
 for a week.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, similar to prior
 exam.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 show no lobar consolidation.  Again a hiatal hernia is present.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. 
 Air-fluid levels noted below the diaphragm may indicate obstruction or delayed
 gastrointestinal transit.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia; question of intestinal obstruction or
 slowed intestinal transit. CT pending.
