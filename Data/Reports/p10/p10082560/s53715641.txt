                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post subtotal colectomy with stool spillage, evaluate
 interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  
 
 An ET tube is present. The carina is not well delineated, but the ET tube lies
 at the upper edge of the medial clavicular heads, approximately 6.3 cm above
 the carina.  A right IJ central line tip is present, tip over proximal SVC. 
 An NG tube is present, tip beneath the diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There is dense opacification of the left mid and lower zones, which could
 represent a combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and its level not defined
 here.  There is hazy opacity at the right base, which may represent a
 combination of layering pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  Doubt upper
 zone redistribution to suggest CHF.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:12 a.m., the ET tube tip lies slightly higher. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Opacification of left mid and lower zones, unchanged.  Possible slight
 worsening of hazy opacity at right base.
 2.  ET tube tip along superior edge of the clavicles, slightly high.  Clinical
 correlation regardomg possible advancement requested.
