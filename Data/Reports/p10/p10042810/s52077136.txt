                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with recent pneumonia, assess for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of both hemidiaphragms.  The
 previous bibasilar opacities have essentially cleared.  The upper lung zones
 are hyperlucent with attenuation of pulmonary vessels and destruction of
 parenchyma, consistent with severe emphysema.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Bilateral hilar
 enlargement is suggestive of underlying pulmonary hypertension.  The heart
 size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval clearing of bibasilar pneumonia.  No additional new consolidation.
 
 
 2. Lung findings consistent with severe emphysema, particularly right upper
 lung zone.
 
 3. Bilateral hilar enlargement, likely secondary to underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.
