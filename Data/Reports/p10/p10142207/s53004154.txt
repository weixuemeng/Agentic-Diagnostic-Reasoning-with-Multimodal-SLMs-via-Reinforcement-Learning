                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, was transferred from outside hospital, intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest were obtained several minutes
 apart, the sedond after adjustment of the endotracheal tube.  First image
 shows endotracheal tube in close proximity to the carina and should be
 withdrawn.  Nasogastric tube below the diaphragm, side port likely near the GE
 junction.  On a second view, endotracheal tube is seen approximately 3 cm from
 the carina, in appropriate position.  Low lung volumes are again seen.  There
 is no confluent consolidation or definite pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is prominence of the superior mediastinum, which could be due to
 tortuous vessels and technique.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position after adjustment.  No
 other change.
