 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting presence of a small right pleural
 effusion.  There also is minimal volume loss in the middle lobe.  At the left
 lung bases, a discoid atelectasis is seen.  Mild cardiomegaly at relatively
 lower lung volumes.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
