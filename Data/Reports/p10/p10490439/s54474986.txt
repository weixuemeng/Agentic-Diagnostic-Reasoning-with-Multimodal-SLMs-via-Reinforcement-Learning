  Asymmetric interstitial edema, left worse than right. Low lung volumes.  New
  retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms may represent aterlectasis versus

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:31 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pancreatitis, bacteremia, now hypoxemia,
 tachycardia and tachypnea.  Is pneumonia or pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ 12:40 a.m.:
 
 Interval increase in the caliber of pulmonary and mediastinal vessels suggests
 volume overload and/or cardiac decompensation.  There is minimal if any
 pulmonary edema, in the left lung only, no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 and no large-scale atelectasis.  The infrahilar left lower lobe is partially
 obscured by the cardiac silhouette and pneumonia is a possibility.  There is
 also the suggestion of at least one lung nodule, 11 mm wide, projecting over
 the left third anterior interspace.
