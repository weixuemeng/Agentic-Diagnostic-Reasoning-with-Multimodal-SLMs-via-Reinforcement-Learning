 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Prominence of the right hilus is only insinuated
 behind the mediastinal shadow due to a slight rotation of the patient's
 position but is unchanged from the prior examination.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
