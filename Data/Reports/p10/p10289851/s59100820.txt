                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___ WITH NO PRIOR
 RADIOGRAPHS FOR COMPARISON
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal but demonstrates left ventricular
 configuration.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  The right hilum appears
 asymmetrically enlarged and more dense than the left hilum with a somewhat
 lobulated configuration.  Lungs are grossly clear and note is made of minimal
 blunting of posterior costophrenic sulci, which could reflect small effusions
 or pleural thickening.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lobulated and dense right hilar contour, raising the possibility of hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  In the absence of older chest radiographs for comparison,
 contrast-enhanced CT would be helpful for further evaluation as communicated
 to Dr. ___ at 3:03 p.m. on ___, by telephone at the time of
 discovery.
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
