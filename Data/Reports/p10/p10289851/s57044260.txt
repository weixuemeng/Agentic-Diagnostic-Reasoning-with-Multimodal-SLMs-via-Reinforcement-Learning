 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and visualized
 upper abdomen is within normal limits.

 New ill-defined opacity within the left lower lobe on frontal projection may
 represent focal atelectasis however given clinical history this is concerning
 for an early pneumonia. It may alternatively represent superimposed shadows

 on the lateral view. If desired and shallow obliques could help further
 clarify.
