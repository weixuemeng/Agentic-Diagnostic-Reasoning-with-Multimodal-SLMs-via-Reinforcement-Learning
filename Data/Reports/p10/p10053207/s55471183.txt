                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Prior right-sided central
 venous catheter is no longer visualized.  Low lung volumes are again noted. 
 There is, however, new opacity at the right lung base.  Somewhat linear left
 basilar opacity is seen suggestive of atelectasis versus scarring.  There is
 no large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially unchanged.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Moderately distended loops of bowel
 seen below the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity likely due to at least some atelectasis,
 noting that infection is also possible.  Distended loops of bowel visualized
 in the upper abdomen for which clinical correlation suggested regarding need
 for additional imaging.
