                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with 2 days of left upper back pain worse with
 movement and inspiration  // r/o acute proccess such as fracture or pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate, gross effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Minimal degenerative change in the thoracic spine could be present.  On the
 available images, there is suggestion of mild right convex curvature in the
 thoracic spine, but this could be positional.  Otherwise, limited assessment
 of osseous structures is grossly unremarkable. No vertebral body compression
 or obvious rib fracture is identified.
 
 Incidental note is made of nonvisualization of the left clavicular companion
 shadow.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. Possible mild right convex curvature and minimal degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.  Limited assessment of osseous structures is otherwise
 grossly unremarkable.
 3. No free air seen seen beneath the diaphragm.  No dilated loops of bowel
 seen in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen.
 4. Nonvisualization of the left clavicular companion shadow.  Clinical
 correlation to assess for any supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is requested.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonvisualization of the left clavicular companion shadow. 
 Clinical correlation to assess for any supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is
 requested.
