                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left sided rib fractures s/p chest tube
 placement; CT on ws - take down at 12:00  // ptx? effusion? - take down at
 12:00
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, left chest tube remains
 in place, with a small left apical pneumothorax.  Based on the oblique
 orientation of the chest tube on the lateral view, an intrafissural location
 is not excluded.  Patchy and linear atelectasis persists in the left lower
 lobe, and note is made of minimal linear atelectasis in the right lung base. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.  Known left rib
 fractures are seen to better detail on recent outside CT.
