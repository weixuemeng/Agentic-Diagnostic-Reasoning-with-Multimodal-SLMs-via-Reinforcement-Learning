                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia and pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild cardiomegaly, possibly
 related to technique.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to the prior
 study from ___ and a small left pleural effusion is again noted. Increasing
 consolidation at the left lung base is seen and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular congestion pattern
 indicative of volume overload. Increasing consolidation at the left lung base
 may be due to developing infection.
