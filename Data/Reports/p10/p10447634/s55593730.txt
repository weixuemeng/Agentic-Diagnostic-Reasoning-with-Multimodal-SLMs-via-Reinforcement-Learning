                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma, intubation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 6.3 cm above the carina at
 approximately 13 mm above the upper edge of the clavicles, unchanged.  An NG
 tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  A right-sided PICC
 line is present, tip partially obscured by the NG tube, but likely overlying
 the mid SVC, retracted compared with ___ at 6:06 a.m.  
 
 Again seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly, and upper zone redistribution. 
 There is probable slight interval improvement in the CHF findings.  Left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle are unchanged.
