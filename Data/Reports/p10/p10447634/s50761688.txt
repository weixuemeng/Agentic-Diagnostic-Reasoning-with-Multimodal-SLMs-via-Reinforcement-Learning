                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm and a right PICC terminates in
 the region of the cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but
 stable in size.  Persistent moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent left
 lower lobe opacity which probably reflects atelectasis.  Right lung is grossly
 clear.
