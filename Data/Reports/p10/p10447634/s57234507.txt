 HISTORY:  Question right lower lobe pneumonia on CT.
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate an infiltrate best seen on

 in both lower lobes.  By the CT, the infiltrate was in the right lower lobe;
 however, there may be a left lower lobe component as well.  The upper lungs
 are clear.
