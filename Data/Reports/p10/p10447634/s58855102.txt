 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left lower
 lobe parenchymal opacity has substantially decreased in extent and severity. 
 There is no new opacity, but both elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and a
 remnant peribronchial parenchymal opacity in the left lower lung persists.  No
 change in appearance of the right lung.  Unchanged course and position of the
 left PICC line.
