                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate likely normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette allowing for AP technique.  Current study is
 somewhat limited due to underpenetration.  There is increased opacity in the
 left base with blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle which could
 represent atelectasis and small left pleural effusion, although early
 pneumonia in this location cannot be excluded.  The upper left lung and right
 lung are well aerated.  There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited study.  Likely atelectasis with small left
 pleural effusion, with early pneumonia not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
