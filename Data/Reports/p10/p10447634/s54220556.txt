                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominent perihilar vasculature suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement. There
 is blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle worry raising concern for
 a trace pleural effusion. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible trace left pleural effusion.
 Top-normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette size.
