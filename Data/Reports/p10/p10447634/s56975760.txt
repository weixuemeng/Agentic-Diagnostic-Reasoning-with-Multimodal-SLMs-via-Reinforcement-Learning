                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Lymphoma, enlarged left-sided neck mass, patient is
 intubated, please evaluate ET tube position.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is not clearly seen on the current examination, most likely 6
 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and
 mediastinum appear to be unchanged including mild cardiomegaly.  Patient is in
 mild vascular engorgement but no edema.  Left mid and lower lobe opacity is
 persistent, worrisome for infectious process.  Right lung base appears to be
 more clear than on prior examination.  The lymphadenopathy and the
 conglomerate in the left lower neck cannot be assessed with the current
 radiograph technique.
