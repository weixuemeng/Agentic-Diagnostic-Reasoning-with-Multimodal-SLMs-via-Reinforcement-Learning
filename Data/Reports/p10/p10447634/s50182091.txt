                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with neck mass, status post surgical biopsy and
 intubation for airway protection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 ET tube is 4.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is out of view below the
 diaphragm.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Left retrocardiac opacities have
 increased, consistent with worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and
 increasing small left pleural effusion.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is also
 increased.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is in the upper
 right atrium, unchanged from prior.
 
 Opacities in the lower lobes could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
