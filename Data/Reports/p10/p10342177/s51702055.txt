                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain for the past two hours.  Assess for pneumonia or
 evidence of effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  The lungs are clear.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracolumbar spine are noted.  Spinal fusion hardware is seen within the
 lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  The colon is interposed
 between the dome of the liver and a chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm;
 there is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
