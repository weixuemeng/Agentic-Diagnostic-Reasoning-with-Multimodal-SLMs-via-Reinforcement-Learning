                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with liver abscesses, status post ERCP,
 complicated by pancreatitis, now status post Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Four frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube that
 is folded over the stomach and reenters the esophagus to the level of the mid
 chest.  Another image demonstrates the Dobbhoff tube folding over in the
 stomach and entering the distal esophagus.  From discussion with the medical
 team, it appears that the tube was initially in the position with the tip in
 the mid chest and subsequently repositioned to the tube tip being in the
 distal esophagus.  The chest radiograph is otherwise essentially unchanged
 from imaging earlier the same day.  Continued opacification at the right lung
 base is again seen, consistent with volume loss and small right effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube is seen in two different positions, both of which
 show the tube tip to be within the esophagus.  The tube will need to be
 repositioned to place the tip within the stomach.  Otherwise, essentially
 unchanged chest radiograph.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 4:00 p.m. by phone.
