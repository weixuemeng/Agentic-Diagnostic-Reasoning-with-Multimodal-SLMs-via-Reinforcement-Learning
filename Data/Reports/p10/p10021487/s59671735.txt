                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent MVC with ileocecectomy and IR drain placement for
 hepatic necrosis, assess for cause of fever and abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the prior
 exam, there has been no significant change.  The right pleural effusion with
 right basal atelectasis is essentially stable.  An air-fluid level in the
 right upper quadrant corresponds with a collection in the right hepatic lobe,
 better assessed on the prior CT scan.  The left lung remains clear.  No
 definite signs of new consolidation.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change with stable right pleural effusion with
 basilar atelectasis and air-fluid level in the right upper quadrant compatible
 with known right hepatic lobe collection.
