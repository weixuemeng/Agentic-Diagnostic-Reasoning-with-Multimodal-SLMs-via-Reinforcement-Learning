                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with rib fracture, evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate healing
 right-sided rib fractures.  There is increase in the air component within a
 large air-fluid collection under an elevated right hemidiaphragm consistent
 with known necrotic right lobe of the liver.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 with right more than left basilar atelectasis, and a large right pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Poor visualization of right-sided rib fractures.  If there is further
 question regarding these, repeat dedicated views are recommended.
 
 2.  Large air-fluid level within the necrotic right lobe of the liver, and
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right base atelectasis and small
 pleural effusion.
