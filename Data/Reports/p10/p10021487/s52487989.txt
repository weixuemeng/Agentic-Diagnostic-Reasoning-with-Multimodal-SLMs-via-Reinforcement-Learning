                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubated.  Status post motor vehicle collision.  To assess for
 the position of endotracheal tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine portable chest view was read in comparison with the most
 recent radiograph from the same day acquired four to five hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following repositioning of the endotracheal tube, the tip ends 6 cm
 above the carina and is adequately positioned.  Left subclavian line tip is in
 mid SVC and orogastric tube ends into the stomach.  Veil-like opacity in the
 right lung suggesting moderate right pleural effusion, left retrocardiac
 increased opacity which is likely a combination of atelectasis and/or small
 effusion is similar.  No interval changes in the lungs.
