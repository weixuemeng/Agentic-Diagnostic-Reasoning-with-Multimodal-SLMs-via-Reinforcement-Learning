                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cancer patient intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.3 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm,
 inferior aspect not included on the image.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated.  There are mild bibasilar opacities which may be due to
 atelectasis although underlying aspiration or infection is not excluded.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude on the left.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with mild bibasilar opacities which may represent
 atelectasis although underlying aspiration or infection not excluded.
