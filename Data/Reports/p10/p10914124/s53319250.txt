                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion status post thoracentesis, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, the right effusion is somewhat smaller.  The
 left effusion is probably unchanged.  There is underlying atelectasis on the
 right and underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the left.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Again seen is the patient's tracheostomy.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  No CHF.  No focal
 infiltrate in the upper or mid zone on either side.  Suspect background
 hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.  
 
 Clips are noted in the right abdomen, possibly in the region of the right
 costovertebral angle and a drain, catheter or other tubing overlies the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval decrease in the right pleural effusion.  Left
 pleural effusion is grossly unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected at either
 lung apex.
