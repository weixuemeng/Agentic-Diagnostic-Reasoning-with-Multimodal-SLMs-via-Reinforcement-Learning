                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Multiple surgical clips project in the right
 upper quadrant.  Cardiac size is normal.  Small right effusion has increased
 and lower lobe consolidation has improved.  The patient has still probably
 collapse of the left lower lobe.  Moderate left effusion is grossly unchanged
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Tracheostomy is in
 standard position.
