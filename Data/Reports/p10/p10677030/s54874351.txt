 FINDINGS: 
 
 The repositioned NG tube has been advanced, now with tip projecting over the
 expected region of the stomach above the diaphragm, corresponding to known
 hiatal hernia.  The stomach/hernia appears distended with gas and layering
 fluid.
 A right subclavian line ends in the low SVC, unchanged.  Increased opacity in
 the left lower lobe likely reflects persistent atelectasis.  No new focal
 consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax.  Streaky linear opacities in
 the right lower lung are likely atelectasis.  Surgical clips are seen in the
 right neck.
