                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___ and chest radiograph
 ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The lungs are well expanded and show an improved
 linear opacity in the right middle lobe.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  Please note that the solid
 nodules noted on the previous CT examination are too small to be characterized
 by chest radiography.  A followup chest CT is recommended as noted in the
 previous report.
