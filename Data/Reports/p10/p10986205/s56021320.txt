                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall 5 days ago, ongoing lower back
 pain; also with pain in the left shoulder
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aorta is diffusely and densely
 calcified. Interstitial opacities are more pronounced in the right lung
 compared to the left, and again may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis is not excluded. Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unchanged. Marked emphysematous changes are again noted. Right
 lower lobe lung mass is not substantially changed in the interval. Previously
 demonstrated pulmonary and pleural metastases are better assessed on the
 previous CT. Small left pleural effusion is again noted. There is no
 pneumothorax. Remote bilateral rib fractures are again seen. Mild compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body remains unchanged. Clips are noted
 in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Unchanged right lower lobe lung mass. Known pulmonary and pleural
 metastases are better demonstrated on the prior CT.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
 3. Interstitial opacities are more pronounced on the right, possibly
 reflective of asymmetric pulmonary edema but lymphangitic carcinomatosis is
 not excluded.
