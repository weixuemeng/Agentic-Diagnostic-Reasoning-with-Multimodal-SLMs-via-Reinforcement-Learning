                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, dCHF, Afib, supratherapeutic INR who
 desaturated to ___% on RA after FFP  // worsening pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___,
 read in conjunction with chest CT at 17:20 on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema is worsened since earlier in the day, with slight
 increase in small bilateral pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable, given the difference between PA and AP techniques.
 
 What is most mysterious is the apparent decrease in size or resolution of a 5
 cm mass seen on the chest CT chest just 5 hr earlier. If the lesion has indeed
 involuted, it is presumably a hematoma. However I would recommend a lateral
 view to see whether it is still present and a diminished by the change in size
 of a posterior lesion between PA and AP projections.
