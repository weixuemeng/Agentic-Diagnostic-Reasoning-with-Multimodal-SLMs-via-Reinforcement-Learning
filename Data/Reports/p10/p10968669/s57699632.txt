                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 4.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including cardiac
 enlargement.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Slight retrocardiac opacity is noted.  Within the limitations of
 technique, the lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suggestion of retrocardiac opacity, probably atelectasis in the setting of low
 volumes.  If there is continuing clinical concern for developing pneumonia,
 however, short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful, preferably with PA
 and lateral technique if feasible.
