                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, concern for PNA  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 556
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. Again
 seen is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution, and increased interstitial
 markings, including focally more pronounced areas in the left mid and lower
 zones and in the right cardiophrenic region.
 
 As before, it is uncertain whether these represent acute or chronic findings
 and whether they represent a a single process alone or a process superimposed
 on some background interstitial changes. The potential differential includes
 background scarring, interstitial edema, inflammatory infectious processes.
 
 The presence of more confluent opacity at the left mid-zone makes it difficult
 to exclude an acute pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings, with focally pronounced areas in left mid
 zone and both bases, similar to a film obtained earlier the same day. The
 possibility of a focal pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
