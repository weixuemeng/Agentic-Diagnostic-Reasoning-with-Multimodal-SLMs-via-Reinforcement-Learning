 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, moderate cardiomegaly is more
 severe particularly evidence of left atrial enlargement. Consolidation in the

 if present are not substantial and there is no pneumothorax.  Rightward
 displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is usually due to enlarged
 left thyroid lobe.
