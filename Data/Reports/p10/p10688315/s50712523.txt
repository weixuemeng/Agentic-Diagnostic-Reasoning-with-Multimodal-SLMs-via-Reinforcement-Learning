 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CT removal now with subcutaneous air  // eval
 for interval change, extent of sub Q air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed on ___, there is increasing
 left retrocardiac density, likely representing atelectasis.  There is likely
 also atelectasis at the right lung base.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax is
 now appreciated.  No pneumothorax on the left.  There is likely a small
 pleural effusion on the right.  A small effusion on the left is difficult to
 exclude.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema along both lateral chest walls persists. 
 Mildly displaced left lateral sixth rib fracture demonstrates no evidence of
 healing.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tiny right apical pneumothorax, without evidence of tension.
 2. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists.
 3. Bibasilar atelectasis, slightly increased.
 4. Re-demonstration of mildly displaced left sixth rib fracture, not yet
 healed.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
