 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously noted tiny biapical pneumothoraces are not well visualized on
 the current study, although may be obscured by overlapping structures.  There
 is likely a small pleural effusion on the right, given blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  No sizable pleural effusion on the left.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is similar.  No other consolidation.  Heart size is normal. 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is only partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited visualization of tiny biapical pneumothoraces, which may have resolved
 or obscured by overlapping structures.  It definitely has not increased in
 size.
