 Lung volumes are similar in appearance when compared to the prior study.  The
 trachea is central.  Mild splaying of the carina likely reflects left atrial
 enlargement.  Increasing bibasilar opacities likely reflect a atelectasis
 however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  No definite pleural
 effusion seen.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, infection cannot be
 excluded.  The appearances of the left lung base in particular are concerning.
