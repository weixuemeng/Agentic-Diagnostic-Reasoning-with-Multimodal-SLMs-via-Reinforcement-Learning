                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Severe aortic stenosis, volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Thoracic scoliosis is noted.  There may be some medial right upper
 lobe scarring.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is no overt pulmonary edema or definite
 focal consolidation seen.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine. 
 Right paratracheal opacity without indentation on the trachea most likely
 relates to underlying vascular structures,
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette without frank pulmonary edema. 
 Thoracic scoliosis.
