                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with head laceration, fever, HIV+
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of bronchovascular
 structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection is not completely
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 identified.  Prominent right nipple shadow is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Infection, particularly atypical pneumonia
 however, is not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
