                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, anemic, and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation of the study is somewhat limited by
 patient rotation.There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette size is
 enlarged, similar when compared to the prior study.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, not significantly
 different when compared to prior study.  A small to moderate right pleural
 effusion is increased when compared to the prior exam.  Right basilar
 opacification may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  Gaseous distention of the stomach
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with increased size of small to moderate
 right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, possibly reflecting
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
