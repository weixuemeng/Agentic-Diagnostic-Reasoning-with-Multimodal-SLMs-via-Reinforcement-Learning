                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left basal ganglia hemorrhage.  Intubated.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 6 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A right subclavian central venous catheter
 ends in the low SVC.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  There is central pulmonary
 vascular congestion without frank interstitial pulmonary edema.  Subsegmental
 left retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed.  Mild elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is not significantly changed.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 similar in appearance.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriately positioned lines and tubes.
 
 2.  Unchanged subsegmental left retrocardiac atelectasis and mild
 cardiomegaly.
