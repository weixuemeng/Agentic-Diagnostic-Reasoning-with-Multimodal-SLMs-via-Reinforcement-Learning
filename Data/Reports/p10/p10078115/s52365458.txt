                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage, now status post
 external ventricular drain placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads.  An NG tube passes through
 the stomach, and a right subclavian central venous catheter tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  
 
 There is an interval decrease in lung volumes; small bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis is mild and increased.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged and unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are little
 changed.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal and improved.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube projects just beyond the thoracic inlet, and might be
 advanced 1.5 cm for more optimal seating.
 
 2.  Interval decrease in lung volumes with increase in bibasilar atelectasis
 and small bilateral pleural effusions, although edema has improved.
