                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath on exertion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  Retrocardiac left base opacity could represent a small
 Bochdalek hernia, but focal consolidation is not entirely excluded, although
 not definitely seen on frontal view.  Costophrenic angles are indistinct,
 which may represent small pleural effusions.  No lobar consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Retrocardiac left base opacitiy could represent a small Bochdalek hernia,
 suggest confirmation with comparison with prior studies or CT to exclude an
 underlying consolidation.
 
 2.  Costophrenic angles are indistinct and could represent small pleural
 effusions.
