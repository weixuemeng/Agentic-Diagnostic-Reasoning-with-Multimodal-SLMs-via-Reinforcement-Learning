                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with active smoker presents with anorexia and
 dizziness, evaluate for mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is a right apical bulla with associated
 pleural thickening.  There is also slight asymmetry in the right infrahilar
 region with a confluent opacity which may be due to confluence of vessels. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Hyperinflated lungs.
 
 2.  Right apical bulla with adjacent asymmetrical right apicolateral pleural
 thickening.  Given the patient's risk factor for lung cancer, a chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation to exclude an apical mass.
 
 3.  Asymmetry of the right infrahilar region, possibly due to confluence of
 vessels.  This can also be assessed at the time of chest CT to exclude a mass
 lesion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were emailed to the ED QA nurse by Dr.___ at 9am on
 ___, following attending review.
