                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:18 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with incarcerated umbilical hernia.  Pulled out
 central venous line.  Assess position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right subclavian line still ends in the mid-to-low SVC.  Moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly is more pronounced and mediastinal veins more dilated, perhaps a
 reflection of supine positioning.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but
 there is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
