                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Evaluation is quite
 limited due to significant scoliotic curvature.  Right mid lung band like
 opacity likely represents atelectasis.  Retrocardiac space is poorly assessed.
 No large effusion is seen.  No definite pneumothorax.  No overt signs of
 pulmonary edema.  No definite acute bony injury though given the marked
 scoliotic curvature, evaluation is quite limited.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly limited evaluation, findings as above.
