                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post operative fixation of right with
 known pneumothorax.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 AP portable upright radiographs were obtained.  The previously demonstrated
 pneumothorax is not definitely seen though vague lucency at the right base
 could reflect a small residual pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear of focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  Heart is normal in size
 with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Prominent loops of bowel are seen in
 the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. Vague right base lucency may
 reflect residual pneumothorax.
