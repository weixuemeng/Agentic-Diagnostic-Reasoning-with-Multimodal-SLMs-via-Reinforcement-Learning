                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  extubation, rib fractures, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  No change in appearance of the cardiac silhouette and
 of the lung parenchyma, with exception of a minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus.  This, however, could be positional.  The known right rib
 fractures are less well seen than on the previous examination.  No current
 evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.
