                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations dated through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-erect radiograph demonstrates improved bilateral aeration. 
 There is continued vascular congestion that may be improved although this can
 be secondarily related to improved aeration.  There is bilateral basilar
 atelectasis with a possible small left pleural effusion.  No new focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  The right-sided PICC is seen at the level of
 the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumonia.  Continued but improved vascular congestion possibly related to
 better aeration.
