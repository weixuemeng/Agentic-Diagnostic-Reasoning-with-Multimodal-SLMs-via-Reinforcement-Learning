                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
 hypothyroidism, recurrent diverticulitis, GERD, and mitral valve prolapse. 
 Complains of shortness of breath, dyspnea, easy fatigability for four months. 
 Questionable evidence for chronic lung disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains
 borderline.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified.  There is a
 relative prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and
 posteriorly, but no significant enlargement of the left atrium can be
 identified on the lateral view.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The
 thoracic aorta is mildly widened and minimally elongated, but does not
 demonstrate any local contour abnormalities or wall calcifications.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures
 demonstrate some mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the form of
 osteophytic reactions at the vertebral body edges, mostly in the lower half of
 the thoracic spine, but no evidence of vertebral body compression fracture
 exists.
 
 When comparison is made with the preceding examination of ___, no significant
 interval change in the chest findings can be observed.  Thus, no evidence of
 acute infiltrates or chronic pulmonary ailment.  Clinical multiple questions
 asked cannot be answered on a single PA and lateral chest view.  Consider
 repeat of chest CT that was performed in conjunction with a preceding
 examination of ___.
