 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p extubation  // eval for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation which worsened appreciably between

 pulmonary edema, and since ___ the process has substantially improved.
 The residual somewhat heterogeneous consolidation mostly in the lower lobes,
 worse on the right, is similar to but less severe than it was on ___.

 mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests there is more edema to
 treat. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small right pleural effusion has
 improved since ___.  No pneumothorax.
