                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke, pneumonia  // Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:43
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extends beneath off film.  The does appear to be any side-port
 in the region of the GE junction, not clearly beyond it.  Again seen is a PICC
 line with the tip near the GE junction, possibly over the upper most right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and blunting of left
 costophrenic angle.  This is overall similar the prior study, but the
 hemidiaphragm is less well seen on today's study, suggesting interval
 worsening.  New slight leftward shift of the cardiac silhouette suggests
 volume loss at the left lung base.
 
 Again seen is hazy somewhat patchy opacity at the right base medially,,
 consistent with less pronounced atelectasis/infiltrate.  .No right effusion.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution could be accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Doubt overt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation again seen, probably slightly
 worse.  There is also evidence for new volume loss at the left lung base,
 reflected by slight leftward shift of the mediastinum.
 
 Patchy opacity right base is unchanged compared with 1 day earlier, but does
 appear more extensive compared with ___.
