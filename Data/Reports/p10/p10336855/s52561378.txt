                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SDH, pneumonia  // Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies 3.7 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip extends beneath
 diaphragm to overlie the stomach.  A right-sided PICC line is again noted. 
 Lead tip is obscured by the EKG marker, but it probably overlies the distal
 most SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with probable small left
 effusion, very slightly improved.  Small left effusion would again be
 difficult to exclude.  Hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is also
 similar to the prior study, but may be slightly more extensive.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent with
 mild CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation is very slightly improved.
 
 Hazy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region may be very slightly more
 extensive.
 
 Mild CHF.
