                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with PMH significant for CHF (EF ___%), COPD (FEV1 ___%), lung
 ca s/p RUL resection and AFib on coumadin presenting with dyspnea and lower
 extremity edema now with fever.  // Please evaluate for possible PNA/acute
 process    Please evaluate for possible PNA/acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure and right apical thickening as well as substantial
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobe and probable small effusion.
 Given all of these pulmonary findings, it is very difficult to unequivocally
 exclude acute focal pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
