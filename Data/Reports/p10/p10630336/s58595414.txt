                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, lung cancer s/p RUL resection and Afib
 now with fevers and increased O2 requirement.  // Please evaluate for
 pulmonary edema versus PNA
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right apical pleural thickening and superior retraction of right hilum are
 stable and consistent with patient's history of right upper lobe resection. 
 There is increased left lung base opacity in the infrahilar region .  Mild
 pulmonary edema is increased.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased left infrahihlar consolidation is probably atelectasis, however
 pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  If feasible, a chest radiograph with PA and
 lateral views would be helpful for better evaluation of left lung base.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If feasible, a chest radiograph with PA and lateral views
 would be helpful for better evaluation of left lung base.
