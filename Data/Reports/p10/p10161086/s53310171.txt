                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration risk with possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  On the frontal view, there is
 suggestion of some hazy opacification with preservation of lung markings on
 the left.  However, this is not appreciated on the lateral view and most
 likely represents merely overlying soft tissues.
 
 No convincing evidence of acute pneumonia.
