                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with assault to the left back.  Evaluation for
 left rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax or focal air space opacity.  The bony structures appear intact,
 with no evidence of displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No evidence of displaced rib fracture on these PA and lateral views.  If
 clinical suspicion remains for non-displaced rib fracture, a dedicated rib
 series or chest CT is recommended.
