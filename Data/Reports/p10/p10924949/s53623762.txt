 HISTORY:  Seizure, evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low and exaggerate pulmonary vascular markings.  There are
 bibasilar atelectatic changes but the lungs are otherwise without a focal
 consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appears stable.  Left
 ventriculoperitoneal shunt is again visualized traversing through the chest
 into the upper abdomen.  No acute fractures are identified.  Severe
 degenerative changes are noted at the right glenohumeral joint with moderate
 degenerative changes throughout the thoracolumbar spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
