                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxic, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:47.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.2 cm above the level
 of the carina.  Nasogastric tube has been advanced, with side port now in
 expected location of the stomach.  A right-sided subclavian central venous
 catheter is again seen, unchanged.  There are bilateral perihilar and
 bilateral lower lobe opacities with air bronchograms suggesting consolidation,
 possibly due to massive aspiration.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.
