                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, hypoxemia, ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing likely below the level of the
 diaphragm, side port in the region of the distal esophagus/GE junction. 
 Inferior aspect not included on the image.  A right-sided subclavian central
 venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  There are extensive bilateral
 mid-to-lower hemithorax opacities which may represent combination of bilateral
 pleural effusions and underlying aspiration given history.  Infectious process
 is not entirely excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not optimally assessed due to the bibasilar opacities.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinum itself does not appear widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 6.5 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 2.  Enteric tube with side port in the distal esophagus, recommend advancement
 so that it is well within the stomach.  The inferior aspect of the tube is not
 included on the image.
 
 3.  Extensive bilateral mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity may be due to
 aspiration and pleural effusion.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:26 p.m. on
