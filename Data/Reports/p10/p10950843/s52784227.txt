                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia and PEA arrest, now with
 pulmonary edema, question improvement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:16.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 6:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube now has its tip projecting over the stomach. 
 Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal SVC.  Patient
 is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac enlargement and stable
 mediastinal contours.  There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation, which
 may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis given the associated layering
 pleural effusion.  There is a slight interval improvement in the bilateral
 airspace process suggesting resolving pulmonary edema.  More focal airspace
 consolidation is again seen in the left upper-to-mid lung, which would be
 concerning for an infectious process, although this also could be seen in the
 setting of asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 Degenerative changes are seen involving the right glenohumeral joint and there
 is destruction or loss of the left humeral head, possibly related to remote
 trauma with resorption or previous surgical resection.
