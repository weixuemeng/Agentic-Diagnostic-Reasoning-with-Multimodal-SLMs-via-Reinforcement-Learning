                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with respiratory failure.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 terminates below the diaphragm.  Left IJ catheter terminates at the
 mid-to-lower SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with mild
 cardiomegaly.  Vascular markings at the right lung base are less prominent,
 compatible with improved vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacity and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with small pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small left pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
