                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Evaluate
 for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.  OG tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
 Left IJ central catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  Mild cardiomegaly and
 the cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Retrocardiac opacity and blunting
 of the costophrenic angles are compatible with bilateral effusions with
 atelectasis, similar to prior.  A peripheral right mid-lung nodular opacity is
 likely fluid along the minor fissure as fluid was seen in this location on
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis,
 similar to prior.
