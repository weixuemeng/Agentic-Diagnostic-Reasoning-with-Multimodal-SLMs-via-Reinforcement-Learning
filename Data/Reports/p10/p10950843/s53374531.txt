                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE SUPINE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:03.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately
 3 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.  Left
 base opacity may be a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  In the interval since the prior
 study, there has been increased prominence and indistinctness of the hila,
 consistent with evolving pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Left humeral head is not seen, although not dedicated imaging of the
 shoulder, query prior trauma/osteolysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior
 aspect not included on the image.
 2.  Left base opacity may represent a combination of pleural effusion or
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
 3.  Pulmonary edema, increased since prior study.
