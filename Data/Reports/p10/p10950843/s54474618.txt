 has its tip in the proximal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is again seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.

 lobe collapse with an associated layering left effusion.  There is worsening
 bilateral airspace disease suggestive of moderate to marked pulmonary edema. 
 Heart remains stably enlarged, no pneumothorax is seen.  Status post median
 sternotomy.  There is destruction of the left humeral head, likely related to
