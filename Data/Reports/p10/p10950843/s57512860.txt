 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ETT.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina.  OG tube terminates
 below the diaphragm.  Left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the
 mid-to-upper SVC.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  Metallic clip overlies the
 right mid abdomen.
 
 There has been interval increase in left pleural effusion, now large.  The
 left upper and lower lobes are now substantially atelectatic.  Indistinct
 right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small right pleural effusion,
 and small adjacent atelectasis is present.  Pulmonary vasculature appears
 indistinct, compatible with increased pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart size appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased left pleural effusion, now large, with adjacent left upper and
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis.  
 2.  Increased pulmonary edema, now moderate.
