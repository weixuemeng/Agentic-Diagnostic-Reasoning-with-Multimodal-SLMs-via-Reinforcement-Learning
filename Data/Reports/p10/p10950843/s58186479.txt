                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 21:23.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PEA arrest, now in the MICU with fever
 and intubated, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 9:46.
 
 Portal semi-erect chest film, ___ at 21:23, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  There is a
 nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC.
 
 2.  There is likely persistent left lower lobe collapse.  There also are
 patchy opacities within both lungs which may represent areas of edema,
 pulmonary hemorrhage, aspiration or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There is likely a small left
 pleural effusion. Bones are osteopenic.  There is narrowing of the right
 acromiohumeral distance which likely reflects chronic rotator cuff tear as
 well as superimposed degenerative changes.  The left humeral head has either
 been resected or has resorbed due to remote trauma.
