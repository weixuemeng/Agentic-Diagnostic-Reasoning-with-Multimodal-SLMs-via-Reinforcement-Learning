                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diastolic congestive heart failure, now with hypoxia.  Please
 evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable severe
 cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions
 identified.  Retrocardiac opacification likely reflects atelectasis related to
 stable significant left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Stable massive cardiomegaly. 
 No pleural effusions.
