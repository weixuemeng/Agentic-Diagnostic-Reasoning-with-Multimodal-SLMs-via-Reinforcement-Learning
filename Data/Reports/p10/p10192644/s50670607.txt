                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain, evaluate for dislocation or fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is
 chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Hyper-inlfation of the right
 hemithorax is likely from emphysema.  The cardiac silhouette remains mild to
 moderately enlarged.  A calcified and tortuous aorta is again seen.
 
 Increased prominence of septal markings, specifically in the right lung,
 reflects mild congestive failure. There is no focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild congestive failure, increased from prior.
