                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with CHF (ejection fraction ___%).  No
 cough or fevers, but worsening leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  The previously observed marked cardiac
 enlargement appears rather unchanged.  Detailed evaluation is impossible
 because of overlying pleural densities obscuring the cardiac contours. 
 Thoracic aorta unaltered.  The pulmonary vasculature is presently distended,
 but does not show evidence of acute interstitial or alveolar edema.  There
 exists bilateral pleural effusion, more marked on the left side where also the
 diaphragm is elevated.  No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates can be
 established.  The amount of pleural effusion appears to be mild-to-moderate as
 judged from the appearance of the mildly blunted posterior pleural sinuses as
 seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly, evidence of bilateral small amounts of
 pleural effusion, but no evidence of new acute infiltrates.  Left-sided
 diaphragmatic elevation as before.
