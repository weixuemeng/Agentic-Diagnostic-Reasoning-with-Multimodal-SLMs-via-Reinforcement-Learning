                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and diminished breath sounds on the left.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Moderate to large left pleural effusion displaces the cardiac silhouette to
 the right.  Although there is severe atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 findings suggest relatively acute accumulation of pleural fluid such as
 empyema or bleeding.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured but probably not
 enlarged.  Right lung grossly clear.  Colonic distention noted in the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen, but no free subdiaphragmatic gas.  Dr. ___
 was paged.
