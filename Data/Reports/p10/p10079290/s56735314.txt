 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 crowding of vasculature and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  Heterogeneous
 opacity partially obscuring the right heart border is seen on this slightly
 rotated film.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal
 contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity partially obscuring right heart border is most consistent with
 atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
