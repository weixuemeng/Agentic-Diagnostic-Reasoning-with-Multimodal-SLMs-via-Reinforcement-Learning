                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement surgery.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are noted along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine.  Suture anchors are present in the left humeral
 head, partly visualized and presumably associated with prior rotator cuff
 repair.  These are not dedicated rib films, but there is no evidence for a
 displaced rib fracture.  Mild rightward convex curvature is centered along the
 lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease or rib fracture.
