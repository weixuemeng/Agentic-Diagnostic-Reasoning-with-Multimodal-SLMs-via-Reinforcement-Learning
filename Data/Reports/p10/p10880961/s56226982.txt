                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
