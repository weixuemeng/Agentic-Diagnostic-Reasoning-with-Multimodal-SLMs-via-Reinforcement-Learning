                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleuritic right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Relatively linear right mid-to-lower lung opacities may relate to vascular
 structures, atelectasis, though early infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
