 Heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial
 effusion should also be considered. A dual lead left-sided pacer remains in
 place with the leads terminating over the expected location of the right
 atrium and right ventricle, respectively. Lung volumes have diminished with
 patchy linear opacities at both bases, left greater than right, more likely
 reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
