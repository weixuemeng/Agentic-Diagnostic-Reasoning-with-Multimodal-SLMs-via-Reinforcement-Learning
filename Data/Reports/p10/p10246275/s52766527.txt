                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and subjective fevers // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph performed on ___, lung
 volumes are lower, which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  There may be a
 subtle opacity at the right lung base, which could represent developing
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Pacer leads terminate in the right atrium
 and right ventricle, as expected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle right lung base opacity may represent developing pneumonia.
