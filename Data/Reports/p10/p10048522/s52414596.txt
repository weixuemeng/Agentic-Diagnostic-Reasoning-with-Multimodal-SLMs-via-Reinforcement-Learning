                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of right-sided breast cancer status post placement of
 Port-A-Cath two weeks prior, now with increasing erythema around the port
 insertion site.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath is in standard position with
 tip reaching the mid SVC.  No radiographic abnormality is identified along the
 course of the port though this examination is not tailored to the evaluation
 of the soft tissues.
