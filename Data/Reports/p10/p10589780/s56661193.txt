                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are mildly reduced.  The heart size is top normal, unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Previously noted nodules within the
 lungs on CT are not clearly demonstrated on the current radiograph.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis.
