                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever and leukopenia.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from ___.
 
 The nasogastric tube has been removed.  There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath
 with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC.  The heart size is within normal
 limits.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There are no signs for
 overt pulmonary edema.  There is a more focal area of increased consolidation
 within the left mid lung field.  Close attention to this area is recommended
 on subsequent exams to exclude underlying infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right mid lung field opacity likely within the left upper lobe which is new
 since the previous study and may represent developing infiltrate.
