                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with coronary artery disease, history of CABG, COPD,
 hypertension presenting with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac silhouette
 size is normal. The aorta remains mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic knob pulmonary vasculature is normal. Hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Linear opacities within both lung bases are unchanged, and likely
 reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis/ scarring. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Lung hyperinflation compatible with
 history of COPD.
