                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, reflecting chronic pulmonary disease.  Chronic
 scarring is again noted at the bilateral lung bases.  The heart is normal in
 size, and the mediastinal contours are normal.  Calcifications on the aortic
 arch are again seen.  The patient is status post median sternotomy, and
 multiple mediastinal surgical clips reflect prior CABG.  The lungs are clear
 of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
