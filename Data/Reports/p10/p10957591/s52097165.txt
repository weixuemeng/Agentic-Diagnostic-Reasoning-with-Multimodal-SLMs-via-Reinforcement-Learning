 lung scarring/atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Aortic calcifications are
 noted.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles could be due to trace
 bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 2.  Evidence of COPD.
 
 3.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
