                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity infection, plan the OR, evaluate for
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are low lung volumes,
 which crowd the pulmonary vasculature.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Given the significant
 overlying soft tissue, low lung volumes are difficult to assess for subtle
 consolidation; however, no definite consolidation is identified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly.  Limited study but no definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
