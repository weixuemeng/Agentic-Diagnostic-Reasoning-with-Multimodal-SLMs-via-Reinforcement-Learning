                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Port-A-Cath placement assessment.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter mid portion is looping within the jugular vein, most
 likely kinking giving its position and appearance on the AP view.  Dedicated
 neck view might be beneficial for precise assessment.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
