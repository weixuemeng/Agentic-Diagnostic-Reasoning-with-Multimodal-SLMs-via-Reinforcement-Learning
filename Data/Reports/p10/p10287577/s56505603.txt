                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperexpanded but clear, with no focal opacities.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The degree of blunting of the left costophrenic angle has increased slightly
 as compared to the prior. This likely represents pleural thickening though
 pneumonia not escluded. The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.  
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with emphysema.
 3.  Subtle increase in opacity at the left costophrenic angle, likely
 represents pleural thickening versus pneumonia. F/u to resolution.
