                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fatigue, malaise and shortness of breath,
 possible history of sarcoid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed.  Overall, lung volumes are
 diminished.  There are linear areas of atelectasis or scarring in both lungs,
 but several smaller irregular opacities in the left mid and lower lung zones. 
 I cannot tell whether these are areas of peribronchial infiltration, even
 bronchiectasis.  Any prior chest imaging should be obtained and CT scanning
 may ultimately be indicated.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
