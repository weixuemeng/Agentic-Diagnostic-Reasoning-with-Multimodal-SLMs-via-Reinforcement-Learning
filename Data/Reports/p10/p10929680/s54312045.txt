                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Lung volumes are low.  There
 is increased interstitial opacity in the right lung base seen on the frontal
 view without correlate on the lateral projection.  This is more pronounced
 since ___.  There is prominent calcification of the right anterior 4th rib
 end.  A right chest Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  There is no
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Likely chronic interstitial opacities in the right lung base may be related to
 post-treatment changes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Treated lung
 neoplasm is not well visualized on this study.
