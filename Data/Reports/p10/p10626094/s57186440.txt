                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lightheaded.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
