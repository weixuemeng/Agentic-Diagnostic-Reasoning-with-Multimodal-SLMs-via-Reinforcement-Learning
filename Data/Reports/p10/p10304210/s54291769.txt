                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and nausea.  Question cardiac
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  There is engorgement
 of the pulmonary vasculature and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen
 bilaterally with parenchymal opacities at the lung bases.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle may be due to a small effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 borderline enlarged for technique.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 at the arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable. 
 Surgical clips noted in the right upper quadrant suggesting prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema, although infection in the
 proper clinical setting is also possible.
