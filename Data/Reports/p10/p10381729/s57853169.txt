                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p PPM placement, subclavian access  // PTX,
 Leads
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 11:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is possible increased opacity at the left
 base, as the left hemidiaphragm is slightly less distinct. Inspiratory volumes
 are lower. Allowing for this, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided dual lead pacemaker, with lead tips over the right
 atrium and right ventricle. Only 1 of the pacemaker leads is well seen on the
 lateral view; the other is obscured due to motion. Allowing for this,
 positioning appears nominal. Heart size, as before, is borderline, likely
 exaggerated by technique. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 On the lateral view, the patient's arm overlies the chest, limiting assessment
 for subtle infiltrate. Even so, the lowermost/ posteriormost portion of the
 lower lobes are well seen . There is possible minimal blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles, but this portion of the lower lobes is
 otherwise clear. More anteriorly, assessment is limited by the overlying arm.
 
 Incidental note is made of ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament
 (DISH).
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dual lead pacemaker with lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 2. Probable atelectasis left lower lung, which may be slightly worse. 
 Inspiratory volumes are noted to be slightly lower.
 3. Minimal blunting of posterior costophrenic angle (s), but no other evidence
 of effusion .
