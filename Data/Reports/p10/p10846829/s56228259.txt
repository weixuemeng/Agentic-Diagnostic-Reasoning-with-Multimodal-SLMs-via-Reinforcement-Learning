                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 3 hours prior on the same
 day, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer with
 the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Low lung volumes result in
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 A retrocardiac opacity could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 Calcifications of the aortic knob are noted.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity could represent either atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
