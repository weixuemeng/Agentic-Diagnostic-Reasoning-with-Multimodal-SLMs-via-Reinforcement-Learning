 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with patchy bibasilar opacities, overall improved from
 same-day radiograph.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Transvenous pacing leads again seen with
 the right ventricular lead not seen on this radiograph.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities; given relative improvement
 from same-day radiograph, findings likely represent atelectasis or
 uncomplicated aspiration.
