                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP semi-erect and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue, chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left costophrenic angle and left diaphragm are not included on
 the frontal view.  The posterior costophrenic angles are not fully included on
 the lateral view; however, no large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Streaky
 opacity at the right lung base is similar to priors and most likely relates to
 atelectasis/scarring.  There is mild prominence of the hila, suggesting
 vascular engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacity at the right lung base, similar to prior,
 suggests atelectasis/scarring rather than infection; however, early infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
