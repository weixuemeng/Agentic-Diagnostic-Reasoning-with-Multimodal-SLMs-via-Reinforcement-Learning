                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 receiving a nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip
 of the tube is not included on the image.  There is increasing opacification
 of the basal and left parts of the left hemithorax, likely caused by a
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The extent of ventilated
 left lung parenchyma is minimal.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  The opacity that
 pre-existed at the right lung base is smaller and less severe than before.
