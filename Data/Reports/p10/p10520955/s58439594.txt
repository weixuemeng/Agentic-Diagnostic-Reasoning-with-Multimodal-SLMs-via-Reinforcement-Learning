                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New hypoxia in the setting of vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Slight increase in interstitial markings bilaterally suggests a
 component of mild interstitial edema.  The right costophrenic angle is similar
 in appearance as compared to the prior study.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  No definite focal consolidation.  Slight prominence of the hila may
 relate to slight fluid overload.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally and slight
 prominence of the hila may be due to mild edema.
