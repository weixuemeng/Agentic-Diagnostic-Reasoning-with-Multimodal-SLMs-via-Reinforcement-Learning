                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Band-like opacities in the mid left and right lower lungs are most consistent
 with minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mildly
 exaggerated kyphotic curvature centered along the mid thoracic spine with mild
 multilevel degenerative changes and probable demineralization.  Surgical clips
 project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
