                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // Evaluate for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacer is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle, unchanged.  Left-sided central venous catheter tip terminates
 in the proximal right atrium.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 present.  Aortic knob calcifications are noted.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  A small left pleural effusion is substantially
 decreased in size compared to the previous study.  Subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring accounts for the linear opacity within the left mid lung field. 
 There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with minimal left basilar atelectasis and
 subsegmental atelectasis or scarring in the left mid lung field.
