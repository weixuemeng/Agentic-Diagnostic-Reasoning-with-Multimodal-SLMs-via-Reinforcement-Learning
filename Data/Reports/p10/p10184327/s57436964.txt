                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  The lung volumes are low.  The interstitium is mild
 to moderately prominent suggesting interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Fissures appear thickened. In the
 left lower lobe, in addition to new bronchovascular opacity, there is a
 rounded expansile opacity seen posteriorly.  The latter is new and may be due
 to a somewhat atypical morphology of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggesting on mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  New posterior left basilar opacities suggesting pneumonia but including a
 somewhat mass-like but newly apparent opacity, new since recent prior
 radiographs.  This may represent an atypical morphology for pneumonia but
 chest CT could be considered to assess further if the opacity were to fail to
 clear adequately on follow-up radiographs.
