                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lead extraction  // s/p lead extraction
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:39 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the right IJ single pacing lead with tip over right ventricle.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are considerably lower. Again seen is left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to
 exclude. The vascular markings are prominent, more so than on the previous
 film, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Minimal atelectasis at the
 right base.
 Heart borders are obscured by left base opacity, but grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably slightly worse.
 2. Vascular plethora, suggestive of CHF, but likely accentuated by low lung
 volumes.
