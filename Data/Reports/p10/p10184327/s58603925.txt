 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:18 PM
  Left-sided HD catheter tip is in the lower SVC. No pneumothorax. Right IJ
  temporary pacer lead terminates in the right ventricle. New streaky
  peribronchial opacities in the right lower lobe are more compatible with
  atelectasis, though infection is possible. Right costophrenic sulcus is not
  imaged. Stable small left pleural effusion.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with parkinsons, ESRD on HD, infected pacemaker,
 s/p removal on abx with temp pacemaker in place. Acutely hypotensive with SBPs
 60s-70s in IR suite with L IJ line placement.  // evidence of pneumothorax?
 post procedure complication?    evidence of pneumothorax? post procedure
 complication?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently one ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacification at the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragm, may
 be accompanied by mild leftward mediastinal shift indicating a component of
 atelectasis, but pneumonia particularly due to aspiration is of great concern,
 since there is a also a new smaller region of consolidation at the medial
 aspect of the right lower lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 presumed.  The heart is not enlarged and there is no pulmonary edema.
 New left supraclavicular dual channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the low
 SVC.  There is no associated mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
