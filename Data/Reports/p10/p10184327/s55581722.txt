                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large pleural left-sided central venous catheter is again seen, grossly
 unchanged in position. A right-sided single lead pacemaker is also as stable
 in position.  Left base opacity with obscuration of the diaphragm likely due
 to pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Left base consolidation may
 also be present. There is also patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region
 although somewhat similar as compared the prior study and most likely
 represents overlap of vascular structures.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left base opacity worrisome for pleural effusion and atelectasis although
 consolidation due to pneumonia may be present.
