                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bacteremia and lead extraction with
 leukocytosis and low grade fever  // evaluation for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 09:14, the degree of consolidation/
 retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base has improved. There is some
 residual retrocardiac opacity as well as a residual small left effusion. Mild
 upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Aside from minimal basilar
 atelectasis, the right lung is grossly clear. No right effusion.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Right IJ the seen lead
 overlies the right ventricle, as before.
 
 On the current study, the tracheal air column is not well visualized between
 the clavicles and aortic knob. It is well seen on the most recent prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Partial interval clearing of retrocardiac density. No new focal infiltrate
 identified.
 2. Poor visualization of a portion of the tracheal air column. Question
 artifact. Clinical correlation requested.
