                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There are patchy
 opacities in the lower lungs including a suspected small pleural effusion on
 the right.  Although infection cannot be excluded, right basilar opacity may
 be due to atelectasis associated with a pleural effusion.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is mildly prominent with upper zone redistribution, although
 without frank edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension or slight
 congestion with a suspected right-sided pleural effusion.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity is probably compatible with associated atelectasis, although
 an infectious process is hard to exclude.
