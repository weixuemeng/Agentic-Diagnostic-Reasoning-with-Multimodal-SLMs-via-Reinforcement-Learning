                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough with yellow sputum, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is interval
 development of a faint opacity in the right lung base on the AP view,
 corresponding to retrocardiac density over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view, which may represent early pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there
 is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is increased in size from
 ___.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity may represent early pneumonia.
 2.  Increased size of cardiac silhouette, ___ raises the
 possibility of pericardial effusion.
