                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, rales and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.  CT trachea ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Known interstitial
 lung disease contributes to a bilateral perihilar interstitial abnormality. 
 In addition to the chronic findings there is bilateral ground-glass opacity
 and interstitial thickening, predominantly radiating from the hila. 
 Cardiomegaly remains moderate.  Aortic arch calcifications are unchanged.  A
 right-sided PICC line terminates in the low SVC.  A left chest Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the right atrium.  Vertebroplasty changes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities on top of chronic pulmonary fibrosis
 most likely represents pulmonary edema.  Infection is less likely.
