                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe osteoporosis and multiple prior fractures.  Evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiomegaly is mild,
 similar to prior.  Prominent interstitial lung markings are compatible with
 known lung fibrosis.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are similar to
 prior and compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The catheter of the left chest wall port
 terminates in the right atrium.  Multiple vertebroplasties are similar to
 prior.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on known lung fibrosis. Severe
 chronic cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension. No displaced rib fracture. 
 Multiple vertebroplasties, similar to prior.
