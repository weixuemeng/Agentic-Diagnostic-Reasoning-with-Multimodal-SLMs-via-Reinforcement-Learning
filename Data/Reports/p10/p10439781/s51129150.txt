                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of interstitial lung disease and
 chronic bronchitis, now presenting with acute dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___ and CT of
 the trachea from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left Port-A-Cath terminates
 in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Lung volumes are extremely low
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding and limited evaluation of the lung
 bases.  Diffuse interstitial opacities have increased, and despite the low
 lung volumes, findings are consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema on a
 background of pulmonary fibrosis. No large pleural effusion is evident.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  High density material within multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies
 is likely related to prior kyphoplasty, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Superimposed pulmonary edema on a background of pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Low lung volumes limit assessment for basilar consolidation.
