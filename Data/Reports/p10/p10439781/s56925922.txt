                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper right atrium.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Fine reticulation associated
 with pulmonary fibrosis appears very similar within each lung in extent and
 distribution with no significant superimposed change.  The lung volumes are
 low.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple compression
 deformities including lower thoracic vertebroplasties appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Severe pulmonary fibrosis, not
 significantly changed.
