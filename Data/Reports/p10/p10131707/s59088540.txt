                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate right Port-A-Cath and central venous catheter locations
 due to positioning within the right atrium noted prior MRI of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiogram from ___ and MRA of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the
 double-lumen catheter terminates well within the right atrium, approximately 7
 cm below the expected location of the cavoatrial junction.  It is unchanged in
 position from the prior study.  The right subclavian line terminates in the
 mid SVC, also unchanged.  The patient has been extubated.  The lungs are
 clear.  There continues to be enlargement of the right atrium. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Sternotomy cerclage wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The double-lumen Port-A-Cath should be retracted approximately 7
 cm to ensure proper positioning in the lower one-third of the SVC.
