 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ESRD, multifocal PNA, respiratory
 failure.  Study requested for evaluation of fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior portable chest radiograph from ___ and ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to previous radiograph from ___, there has
 been substantial change. There has been unilateral progression of the disease,
 predominantly on the right, with marked increase of the right-sided pleural
 effusion. Increased right sided pleural fluid accentuates existing opacities,
 particularly the dense consolidation in the right upper lobe. There is
 atelectasis of the lower lobes. There has been no substantial change in the
 left side. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial interval worsening of right-sided pleural effusion
 with no substantial change in left lung.
