                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a history of strep pneumoniae bacteremia and
 pneumonia now intubated.  Question ET tube placement and disease progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  A right
 transjugular central venous catheter has tip in the lower SVC.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly, which is accentuated by AP technique.  There is
 progressive increase in dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and also
 increased opacities in the left perihilar region and left lower lobe,
 consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia.  The left lung is reasonably
 aerated, with streaky subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  There
 is likely a small right pleural effusion.
  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Appropriate ET tube positioning.  
 2. Interval progression of multifocal pneumonia.
