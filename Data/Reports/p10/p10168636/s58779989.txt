                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after descending aortic
 replacement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at
 the level of the right main pulmonary artery.  The chest tubes are not clearly
 seen but potentially a drainage is present on the right.  These sutures are
 unremarkable.  The left chest tube on the left is in the apex.  There is no
 appreciable pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely
 present.
