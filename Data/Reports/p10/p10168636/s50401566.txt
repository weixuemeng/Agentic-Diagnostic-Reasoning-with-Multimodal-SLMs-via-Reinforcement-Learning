 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post replacement of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The parenchymal opacities in the left lung increase in
 severity, likely reflecting decreased ventilation.  The right lung volume has
 also minimally decreased.  Overall, changes could be the effect of decreased
 ventilatory pressure.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette.
