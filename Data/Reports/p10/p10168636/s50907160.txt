                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is unchanged unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta with an an usual contour consistent with prior aneurysm
 repair.  The ascending aorta appears slightly more prominent since the prior
 study, and this may be due to patient rotation.  The cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant difference in the prominent descending thoracic aortic contour
 due to prior aneurysm repair given differences in technique.  More prominent
 appearance of ascending aortic contour may reflect patient rotation.  However,
 if there is Clinical concern for acute aortic pathology, MRA should be
 obtained.  No focal consolidation.
