                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with neutropenic fever, evaluate for
 consolidation or infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormality
 is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral pleural sinuses
 are free.  No pneumothorax in apical area.  A previously described left
 subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position
 terminating in the lower SVC.
 
 Comparison with the next preceding examination, a significant smaller size of
 the heart shadow is noted simultaneously.  Also, a less plethoric appearance
 of the pulmonary vasculature is noted but there were never any signs of
 congestion, pleural effusion, or cardiac configurational abnormality.  The
 change can be explained by differences in total circulating blood volume.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pulmonary abnormalities.
