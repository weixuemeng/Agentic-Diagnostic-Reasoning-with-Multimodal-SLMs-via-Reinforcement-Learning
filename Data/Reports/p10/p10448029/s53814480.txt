 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a subtle posterior basilar opacity on the lateral view, not well
 substantiated on the frontal view which may be due to atelectasis although an
 early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 The pulmonary arteries are prominent and were seen to be dilated and chest CTA
 from ___ which may be due to underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Difficult to exclude left-sided hilar adenopathy although findings are felt to
 most likely be related to the pulmonary artery.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal mediastinal contours are stable.
