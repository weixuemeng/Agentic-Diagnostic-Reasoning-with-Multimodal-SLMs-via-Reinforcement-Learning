 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 507 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post fall with multiple fractures,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 6 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heart remains enlarged.  There is persistent opacification at the left
 base which may reflect a combination of atelectasis in the setting of a
 layering effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Right lung
 is grossly clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Fractures of the left
 seventh through ninth posterolateral ribs are again identified.  Deformity of
 some of the right ribs likely reflects remote fractures.  No pneumothorax. 
 Prominent costochondral calcifications.  Calcification of the aorta consistent
 with atherosclerosis.
