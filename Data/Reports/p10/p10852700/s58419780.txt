                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with rib fractures; evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 
 Opacification at the left lung base may represent layering pleural effusion
 versus atelectasis.  The right lung is clear.  Fractures of the left seventh
 through ninth posterolateral ribs are again identified.  Deformities of the
 right ribs may represent old fractures.  There is no pneumothorax.  Prominent
 costochondral calcifications are noted.  Calcification of the aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerosis.
