                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prolonged dry cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia and lesions.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, accentuating the cardiac contour and pulmonary vasculature.  The
 heart size is enlarged and there is a tortuous descending aorta.  Otherwise,
 the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No focal opacity
 concerning for pneumonia is seen.  No lung lesions are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no good evidence for pneumonia or
 malignancy.
