 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bilateral lower leg edema  // eval for
 pulmonary edema vs pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices.  The patient is also
 somewhat rotated.  Given the above, there are low lung volumes with persistent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.  There is left mid lung
 linear atelectasis/ scarring. Mild to moderate interstitial edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate interstitial edema may be slightly exaggerated due to low
 lung volumes.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
