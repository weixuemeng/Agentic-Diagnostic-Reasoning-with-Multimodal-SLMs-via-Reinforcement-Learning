                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with congestive heart failure, 9 lb weight gain over
 3 weeks, worsening lower extremity edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Low lung volumes are
 present.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours appear
 unchanged.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is noted with probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appears
 to be chronic.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  The
 osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
