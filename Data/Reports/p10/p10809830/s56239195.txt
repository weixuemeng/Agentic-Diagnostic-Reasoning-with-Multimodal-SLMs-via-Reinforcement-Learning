                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Amiodarone screening.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change.  Again
 there are low lung volumes which accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 heart in this patient with intact midline sternal wires and evidence of CABG
 procedure.  No vascular congestion or pleural effusion or acute focal
 pneumonia.  There is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour.  
 
 Specifically, no evidence of interstitial prominence to suggest amiodarone
 toxicity.
