                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carinal. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A platelike opacity projecting over the
 left lower lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring. Aeration has improved
 at the medial right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation. Better aeration at the right lung base;
 otherwise no significant change.
