 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sputum production and poor oxygentation 
 // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  Mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema persists.  Also persistent and overall unchanged is a
 focal parenchymal opacity in the middle lobe, blunting the contour of the
 right hemidiaphragm and likely accompanied by a small pleural effusion.  The
 finding could reflect pneumonia or aspiration.  Mild cardiomegaly with left
 lower lobe atelectasis persists.  No pneumothorax.  The monitoring and support
 devices are constant.
