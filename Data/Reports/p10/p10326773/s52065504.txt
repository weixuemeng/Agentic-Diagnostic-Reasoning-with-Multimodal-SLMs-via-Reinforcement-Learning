 An endotracheal tube is in stable position. Enteric tube descends below the
 field of view.  Lung volumes are low, which accentuates bronchovascular

 lung volumes. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. No significant change from the prior examination.
