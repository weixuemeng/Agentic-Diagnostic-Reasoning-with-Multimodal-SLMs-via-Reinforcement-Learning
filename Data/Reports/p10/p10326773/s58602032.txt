 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  APsingle view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the Carina.  Enteric tube is
 visualized only in the upper mediastinum and not seen clearly, likely due to
 underpenetration.  There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar and
 lower lobe opacities with cardiomegaly compatible with worsening pulmonary
 edema.  Likely bilateral small pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Bony
 thorax is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided central venous catheter tip projects over the mid SVC, unchanged
 compared to the prior radiograph.
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema and/ or bibasilar atelectasis.  Enteric tube is not
 clearly visualized on this radiograph and a repeat chest radiograph with
 better penetration may be obtained to evaluate for the same.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Enteric tube is not clearly visualized on this radiograph,
 may be retracted and a repeat chest radiograph with better  penetration may be
 obtained to evaluate for the same.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr.  ___, MD  with
