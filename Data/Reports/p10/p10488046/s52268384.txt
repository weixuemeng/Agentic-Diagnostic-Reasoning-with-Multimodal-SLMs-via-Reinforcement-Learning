                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent central line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the size of the cardiac and mediastinal contours,
 with the heart size appearing moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. 
 Widening of the superior mediastinal contour, particularly the right may be
 due to the presence of mediastinal fat and prominent vessels. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted, without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the left lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.  Mild
 degenerative changes are seen in the left glenohumeral joint. No central
 venous catheter is demonstrated.Patient is status post kyphoplasty at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No central venous catheter identified. No large pneumothorax is present,
 though assessment is limited on this supine exam. If there is continued
 concern, dedicated upright PA view is recommended.
 2. Low lung volumes with left basilar atelectasis and crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.
