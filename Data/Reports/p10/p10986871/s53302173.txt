 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating mild

 atelectasis.  Lower lung volumes on the current exam results in crowding of
 the bronchovascular markings.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is marked degenerative
 change involving the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
