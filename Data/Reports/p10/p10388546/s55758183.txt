 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are

 focal consolidation.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly may
 suggest a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.  Mild loss of height of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is re- demonstrated as is diffuse osteopenia.

 Small left pleural effusion posteriorly.  No focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
