                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:41
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post intubation, check endotracheal
 tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 12:46 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 7:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip approximately 5 cm
 above the carina.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its
 tip in the proximal SVC.  There continues to be a layering right effusion with
 associated airspace opacity at the right base suggestive of compressive
 atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Remaining lungs are grossly clear.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 appreciated.
