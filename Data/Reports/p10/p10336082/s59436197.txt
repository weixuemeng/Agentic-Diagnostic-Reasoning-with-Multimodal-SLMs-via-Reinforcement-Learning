                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is consistent with a moderate pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude.  There is mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  A left-sided PICC is
 again seen, distal aspect not well appreciated; however, seen to at least the
 level of the low SVC.  Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Difficult to
 exclude small right pleural effusion.  Moderate interstitial edema.  Left base
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion or
 atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded.
