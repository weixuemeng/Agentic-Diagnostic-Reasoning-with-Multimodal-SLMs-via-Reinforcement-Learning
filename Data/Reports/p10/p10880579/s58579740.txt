                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hepatocellular carcinoma, now with fever and
 respiratory desaturation, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The overall appearance of the chest is unchanged from ___. 
 There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  A meniscus level
 and blunting at the right costophrenic angle suggest a small right pleural
 effusion, unchanged.  No new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is
 seen.  No significant pneumothorax or left pleural effusion is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged from the
 prior study.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Slightly increased
 opacification at the bilateral lung fields is likely related to
 bronchovascular crowding and slightly decreased lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Stable appearance of the
 chest from ___.
 2. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary
 embolism.
