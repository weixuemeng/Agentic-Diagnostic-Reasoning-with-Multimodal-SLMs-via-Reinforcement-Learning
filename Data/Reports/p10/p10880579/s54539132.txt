                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with liver cancer.  Now with hypoxia on room
 air.  Previous portable chest x-ray done because of the patient's pain, now
 much improved.  Please assess for effusion or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to portable radiograph of the chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As compared to
 the prior study, there is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm most
 likely due to hepatomegaly, with associated atelectasis of the right lung
 base.  There is also a focal consolidation in the right lower lobe, best seen
 on the lateral view which is concerning for an infectious process in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no evidence of large pleural effusion.
 Previously seen biliary stents and ERCP stent are unchanged in position since
 the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Posterior right lower lobe consolidation best seen on the lateral
 view would be consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ page at
 ___, 10 minutes after the finding was discovered and the findings were
 subsequently discussed over the telephone.
