 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with liver cancer.  Increased shortness of
 breath and oxygen demand.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with
 some associated bibasilar atelectasis.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax, focal pneumonia, large pleural effusion, or
 pulmonary edema.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which may be
 due to hepatomegaly, contributing to low lung volumes.  Biliary stents are
 seen in the abdomen and ERCP stent is seen within the stomach, as before, on
 biliary catheter check from ___.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis.
