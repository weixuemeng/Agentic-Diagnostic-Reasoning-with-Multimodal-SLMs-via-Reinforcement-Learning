                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed and compared
 to the prior studies.  The right upper lobe opacity could be due to pneumonia
 or asymmetric pulmonary edema, in a pattern seen particularly in mitral
 regurgitation.  A small pericardial effusion is of undetermined chronicity. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, and pleural and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New increased right upper lobe opacity could be due to pneumonia or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema seen particularly in mitral regurgitation.
 2.  Unchanged mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Small pericardial effusion, of indeterminate chronicity.
