                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F type 2 diabetes mellitus, with 5 days cough and
 possible history of TB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal patchy opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis, though early
 infection in the right lung base cannot be completely excluded.  No evidence
 for active tuberculosis.
