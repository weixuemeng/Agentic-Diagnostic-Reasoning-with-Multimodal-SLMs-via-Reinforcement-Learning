                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question edema, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly, with a calcified aorta.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density with air bronchograms, though the left hemidiaphragm is
 visualized.  There is upper zone redistribution and prominence of interstitial
 markings with slight peribronchial thickening.  Plate-like atelectasis noted
 in right mid zone.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle could
 reflect a small amount of pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Upper zone redistribution and increased interstitial markings, likely
 reflecting CHF.
 
 3.  Increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, but visualization of
 the left hemidiaphragm, ?consolidation in lingula.
