                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of aVM And seizures, sedated from AEDs -
 currently possible aspiration  // ?aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to the chest x-ray from ___ at 10:35 plus
 allowing for considerable technical differences, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.  The patient has known biapical scarring
 with retraction of the hila, which is not well demonstrated on this study due
 to the degree of angulation.  Allowing for this, no new focal opacity to
 confirm the presence of aspiration is identified.  There is suggestion of
 slight coarsening of the lung markings of both lung bases, but no definite
 infiltrate.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion detected.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation.
 2. Slight coarsening of markings at both lung bases raises the possibility of
 early post aspiration changes, but no definite infiltrate is identified.
 3. Known upper zone infiltrates are noted, but not especially well
 demonstrated due to technical factors.
