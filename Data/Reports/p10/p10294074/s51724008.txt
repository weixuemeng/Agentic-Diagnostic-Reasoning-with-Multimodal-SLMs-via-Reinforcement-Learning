                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New onset of asthma.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable.  There is
 questionable right hilar fullness seen better on the PA view with no findings
 on the lateral view.  It is unclear if it is a new finding or confluence of
 vasculature, correlation with chest CT might be considered.  No other findings
 demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
