                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately
 1.2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach and off
 the image.  Bilateral pleural effusions are now evident.  The parenchymal
 opacity at the level of the left upper lobe has improved since the prior
 study, perhaps reflecting improved aeration secondary to the intubation. 
 There is interval increased right basilar opacity, possibly relating to
 pleural effusion.  Heart size remains top normal.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is possibly due to combination of edema as well as
 low lung volumes.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube approximately 1.2 cm from the carina and can be retracted for
 better positioning.
 2.  Improving right upper lobe opacity likely due to improved aeration.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions. Right base opacity maybe due to pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.
