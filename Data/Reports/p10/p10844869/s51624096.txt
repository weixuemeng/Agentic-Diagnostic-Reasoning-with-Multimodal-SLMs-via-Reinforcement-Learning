                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD exacerbation  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with moderate pulmonary edema,
 widening of the vascular pedicle, and probable right pleural effusion with
 compressive atelectasis at the base. The area of chronic loculated left
 pleural effusion with round atelectasis is not well appreciated, probably due
 to mild obliquity of the patient.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
