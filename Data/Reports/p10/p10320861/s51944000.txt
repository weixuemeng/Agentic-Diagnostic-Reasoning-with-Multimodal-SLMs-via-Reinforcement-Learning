                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with placement of the Hickman catheter.  Evaluate
 catheter placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate left pleural effusion is overall unchanged.  There is probably
 associated read compressive atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged, likely from cardiomegaly as the CT on ___ did not show a large
 pericardial effusion.  The new catheter tip projects over the expected region
 of the low SVC.  No evidence of a pneumothorax.  No evidence of a large right
 pleural effusion.  The right lung is essentially clear.  Clips are noted
 throughout the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Newly placed right IJ approach catheter tip projects over the expected
 region of the low SVC.
 2.  Unchanged enlarged cardiac silhouette.
 3.  Unchanged moderate left pleural effusion and likely compressive
 atelectasis.
