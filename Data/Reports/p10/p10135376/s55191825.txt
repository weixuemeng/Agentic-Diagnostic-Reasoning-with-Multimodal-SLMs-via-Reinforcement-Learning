                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP and swan, swan
 advanced for poor positioning  // ___ placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of earlier the same date, a Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been repositioned, with tip now terminating in the right ventricular outflow
 track.  There continues to be redundancy and looping of the catheter more
 proximally in the right atrium.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for interval
 worsening of pulmonary edema and slight increase in size of a small right
 pleural effusion.  No other relevant change.
