                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic/septic shock  // Placement of
 IABP? Pulmonary edema? Pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a Swan-Ganz catheter
 has changed in position, now coiling within the right atrium before
 terminating in the right ventricle directed towards the outflow tract. 
 Intra-aortic balloon pump remains in place, with radiodense tip terminating
 1.9 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.  Exam is otherwise
 similar to the recent radiograph except for slight worsening of pulmonary
 edema and slightly improved aeration at the left lung base.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  At the time of this dictation, a subsequent chest radiograph
 has already been performed with repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
