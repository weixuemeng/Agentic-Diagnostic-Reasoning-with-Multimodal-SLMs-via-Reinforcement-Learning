                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing shortness of breath, abdonminal
 distention  // evaluate for pleural effusion or pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. 
 There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion with fluid seen tracking
 in the minor fissure, and overlying atelectasis.  Right base opacity may be
 due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, consolidation
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is a trace left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal to no pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Anchor screws are noted overlying the right humeral
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
 
 Medial right lower lung opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
