 // ?pulmonary effusions vs edema      ?pulmonary effusions vs edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a
 patient with previous CABG procedure an intact midline sternal wires.  The
 lack of appreciable vascular congestion suggests that the appearance could
 reflect cardiomyopathy or even possibly pericardial effusion.
 The degree of right pleural effusion is less prominent on the current lateral
 view, though there does appear to be fluid extending into the minor fissure on
 the right.  Mild basilar atelectatic changes are seen on the right, though
 there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
