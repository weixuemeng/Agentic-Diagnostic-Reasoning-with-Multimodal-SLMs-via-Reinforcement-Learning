                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is patchy left basilar opacification, but decreased, and probably
 compatible with atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion, although
 an effusion would be difficult to exclude on the left side.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes and spinal curvature appear similar along
 the visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacification, but decreased, and accordingly
 likely due to resolving atelectasis or potentially improving infection in the
 appropriate setting.
