                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is noted.  The aorta remains
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The hilar contours are prominent, but this
 is unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement persists, and a small right
 pleural effusion is likely present.  Retrocardiac opacity could reflect
 atelectasis but aspiration or infection are not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion.
 
 2. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection and aspiration
 are not excluded.
