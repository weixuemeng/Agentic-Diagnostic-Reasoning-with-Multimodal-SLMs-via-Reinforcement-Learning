                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest wall pain after fall.  Eval for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph above ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are slightly lower,
 causing crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Heart size, mediastinum, and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Except for mild bibasilar atelectatic changes,
 lungs are clear without pleural effusions, focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax.  Small linear hyperdensity projecting over the left upper
 abdominal quadrant has no correlate on the lateral view, and may be a surgical
 clip or outside the patient.  No acute fracture identified.  Severe
 degenerative change of the left glenohumeral joint appears slightly worse. 
 Moderate right glenohumeral joint degenerative disease is unchanged.  No
 fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectatic
 changes.
 
 2.  No fracture identified.  Please note, however, the chest radiograph is not
 optimal for evaluation of bony detail.  If clinical concern persists, consider
 CT chest for further evaluation.
