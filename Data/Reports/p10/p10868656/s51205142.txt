                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and wheezing, rule out
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph excludes the left
 hemidiaphragm, limiting evaluation.  There is bibasilar opacity, new compared
 with the prior study.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  The mediastinum
 appears widened, which may be due to portable technique, with unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable bibasilar atelectasis, though study is limited due to
 technique. Recommend repeat frontal and lateral chest radiographs in the
 radiology department when the patient is stable.
