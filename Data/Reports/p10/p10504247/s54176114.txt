                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Alzheimer's status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a
 chronic-appearing deformity of the sternum; however, the bones are not well
 visualized on this non-dedicated view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chest radiography
 is insensitive for bony processes, and dedicated radiographs should be
 obtained as clinically indicated.
