                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bibasilar atelectatic changes.  However, more focal
 opacity in the right middle lobe may be representative of a developing right
 middle lobe pneumonia.  Previously visualized right apical spiculated nodule
 is again identified and continued to follow up as per CT is recommended. 
 Multiple other pulmonary nodules previously visualized on CT are better
 visualized on prior CT from ___.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  No acute fractures identified.
