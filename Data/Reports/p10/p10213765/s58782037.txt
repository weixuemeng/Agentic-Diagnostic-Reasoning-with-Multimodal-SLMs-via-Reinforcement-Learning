 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:47 PM
  Known right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are better assessed on CT of
  the torso from the same day. Small amount of pneumomediastinum is identified. 
  Right-sided lung parenchymal opacities are consistent with contusions in the
  setting of trauma.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fall with rib frx, pneumothorax,
 pneumomediastinum  // Pls perform at 6 PM. please look for interval change in
 pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum     Pls perform at 6 PM. please look for
 interval change in , pn
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and chest CT performed between ___ and 11:45
 today.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe, new since earlier in the
 day is local bleeding due to contusion and small laceration seen on the chest
 CT scan. Followup advised.
 
 Small right pneumothorax, confirmed by the chest CT scan, is most readily seen
 along the right lower costal surface and is no larger now than it was earlier
 in the day.
 
 Small pneumomediastinum is unchanged. In the setting of closed chest trauma
 this need not indicate disruption of the esophagus or tracheal bronchial tree,
 either of which would probably produce more air in the mediastinum and
 conceivably hemo mediastinal hematoma. Otherwise the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette has a normal appearance. Left lung is clear and there is no left
 pleural abnormality.
 
 Detection of chest wall trauma is more reliable with torso CT.
