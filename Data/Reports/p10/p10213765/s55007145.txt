 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___, read in conjunction with torso

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The expiration view was obtained on the instructions of the requesting
 physician.  This may account for the apparent increase in size of the small
 right pneumothorax which, in reality, may be unchanged.  It may also
 exaggerate the confluence of the previous consolidation in the right lower
 lobe due to local bleeding.  I have discussed the advisability of retaining of
 obtaining full inspiratory chest radiographs hereafter.
 Interval increase in heart size and mediastinal venous caliber is due in part
 to lower lung volumes, but most likely increased intravascular volume as well.
 Left lung is clear and there is no left pleural abnormality.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone
 on ___ at 10:44 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.  The

 the lung or pneumonia.
