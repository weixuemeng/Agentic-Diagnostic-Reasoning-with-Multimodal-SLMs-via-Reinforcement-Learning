                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough productive of yellow sputum, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, and no
 focal consolidation is present.  Punctate calcifications are noted within the
 left lung, likely granulomas.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis,
 but early infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
