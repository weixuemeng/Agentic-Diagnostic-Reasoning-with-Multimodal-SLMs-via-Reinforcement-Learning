                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, vascular dementia with mechanical fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. 
 Aortic knob calcifications are present.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear
 opacities in both lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests a trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and probable trace left pleural effusion. 
 Unchanged moderate size hiatal hernia.
