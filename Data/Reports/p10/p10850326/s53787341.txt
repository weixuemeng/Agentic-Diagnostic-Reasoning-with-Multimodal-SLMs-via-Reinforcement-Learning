                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Upper lobe
 scarring with possible bronchiectasis, best seen on the lateral view,
 correlate with history of chronic lung disease.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is minor right
 upper lobe linear atelectasis/scarring.  The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Note is made of air-distended loops of bowel in
 the upper abdomen.  However, not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Biapical thickening.  Upper lobe scarring with possible
 bronchiectasis, best seen on the lateral view, correlate with history of
 chronic lung disease.
