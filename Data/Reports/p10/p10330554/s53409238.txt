                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Unsteady gait, weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis though infection is not
 completely excluded.
