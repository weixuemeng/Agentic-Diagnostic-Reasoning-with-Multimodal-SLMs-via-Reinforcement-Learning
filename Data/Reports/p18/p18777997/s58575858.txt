                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous and pulmonary vessels
 are within normal limits.  Lungs are clear except for a patchy infrahilar
 opacity on the right.  There is no pleural effusion.  Healed displaced right
 rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy right infrahilar opacity of uncertain significance.  This could be
 due to localized aspiration, atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  Short-term
 followup radiographs would be helpful to document resolution and to exclude a
 neoplasm.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
