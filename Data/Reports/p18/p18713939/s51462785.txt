                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with confusion  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  Streaky horizontal
 opacities in the left lung base it is probably atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacity with slight indistinctness of the lateral aspect of the descending
 aorta may also reflect atelectasis, although concurrent infection appropriate
 clinical situation is possible.  No edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.  No acute osseous abnormality. Degenerative
 changes in in the bilateral AC joints are moderate.  Moderate degenerative
 change since the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding.  Left basilar opacity,
 potentially atelectasis noting that infection cannot be excluded.
