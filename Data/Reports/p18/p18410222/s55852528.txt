 Since the prior study there has been interval improvement of the right upper
 lobe atelectasis with still present partial opacities that might represent be
 expanding pulmonary tissue but on the other hand can represent developing
 infectious process. There is also substantial interval increase in the right
 lower lobe opacity which is concerning for developing into infection. The
 unilateral nature of the process would be in fever of infection of or ARDS but
 that cannot be excluded as well. Left basal opacity is minimal. ET tube, right
 internal jugular line and NG tube are in unchanged unremarkable positions.  No
 definitive pneumothorax seen on this examination. Multiple rib fractures are
 re- demonstrated
