 grossly unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are also stable, but this does not
 exclude mediastinal bleeding. Widening of the right apical pleural margin
 could be due to loculated pleural or extrapleural fluid, an should be
 monitored to detect any indication of bleeding from the chest cage hila or
 mediastinum.
