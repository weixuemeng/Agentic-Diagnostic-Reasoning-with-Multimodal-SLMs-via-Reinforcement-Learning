 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p bronchoscopy with RML/RLL purulence  //
 evaluate for interval change      evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ 1:36 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The extent of right pleural or extrapleural bleeding is small, and has not
 increased since earlier in the day when concern was raised about interval
 widening of the right apical pleural margin, now considerably smaller than it
 was at 13:46.  Aeration in the right lung has diminished, probably due to
 increasing bands of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left lung is
 grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, including a dilated
 or tortuous thoracic aorta.
 ET tube tip is partially obscured by spinal hardware, but ends at least 3 cm
 above the carina.  Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and a feeding
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
