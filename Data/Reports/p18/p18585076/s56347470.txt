                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Autoimmune pancreatitis, chronic sclerosing cholangitis, confirm
 PICC position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been
 pulled back.  The tip of the line now projects over the inflow region of the
 brachiocephalic vein into the superior vena cava.  To ensure correct position
 in the mid-to-lower SVC, the line must be advanced by approximately 5-6 cm or
 a new line must be placed.  There is no evidence of complications.  Otherwise,
 no relevant change.  Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
