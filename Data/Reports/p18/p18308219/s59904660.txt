 PORTABLE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Parapharyngeal abscess, assess for aspiration.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Ill-defined peribronchial opacities in the lower
 lobes, larger on the right lower lobe could be due to atelectasis or
 aspiration, given the clinical concern.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
