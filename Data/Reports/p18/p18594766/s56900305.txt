                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 16:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 21:26.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 16:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line is at the level of the proximal SVC, but
 the tip is obscured by the overlying spinal hardware projecting over the upper
 and mid thoracic vertebrae.  There has been interval removal of the left chest
 tube with no evidence of a pneumothorax.  Persistent opacification at the left
 base likely reflects a combination of partial lower lobe atelectasis and
 pleural fluid.  The right lung remains well inflated and clear.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Heart is stably enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged given differences in patient rotation.
