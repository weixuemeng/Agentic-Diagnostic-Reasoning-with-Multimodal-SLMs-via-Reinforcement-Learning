                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 21:26
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tube to waterseal, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 15:58.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 21:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the proximal SVC.  Spinal
 hardware is seen overlying the upper and mid thoracic spine.  A left chest
 tube is in place.  No pneumothorax is seen.  However, there is airspace
 opacity at the left lung base with an associated elevated left hemidiaphragm. 
 These findings together would favor lower lobe atelectasis rather than
 aspiration or acute infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The
 right lung is grossly clear.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to heart border being obscured and overlying spinal
 hardware.
