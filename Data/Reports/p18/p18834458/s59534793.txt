                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with new cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hyperinflation of the lungs, flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms, and relative lucency of the upper lung zones consistent with
 patient's known COPD.  There are no consolidations or pleural effusion.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is
 stable calcification of the aortic arch.  Clips in the left lower lung zone
 reflect prior wedge resection and are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Severe COPD.
