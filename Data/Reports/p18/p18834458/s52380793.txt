                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD with concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  A moderately tortuous aorta is again seen.  There is a left
 basilar surgical clip.  Again seen are hyperinflated lungs with hyperlucency
 of the upper zones, compatible with known COPD.  Bibasilar hazy opacities are
 minimally changed since ___, overall worsened since ___,
 likely representing recent atypical infection.  The central pulmonary vessels
 are not engorged, less compatible with edema.  No new consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bibasilar opacities, minimally changed since ___, but overall worse since ___, most compatible with recent
 atpical infection.
