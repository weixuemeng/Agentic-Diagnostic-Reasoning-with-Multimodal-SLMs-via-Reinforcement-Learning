                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 The lungs are hyperexpanded, with marked hyperlucency at the upper zones,
 reflecting severe COPD.  Ground-glass opacities at the bilateral lower lungs
 have worsened since ___.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits. The central pulmonary vessels are normal in caliber.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities in the setting of severe COPD,
 compatible with infection.  Edema is unlikely given lack of central pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
