                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung hyperinflation, including flattening of the hemidiaphragms, is
 most likely due to COPD.  Mild ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lower
 lungs likely represent an atypical infection similar to opacities seen on the
 previous CT on ___.  A typical pyogenic infection would likely have
 more confluent opacities.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral ground-glass opacities likely represent an atypical infection.
 2.  Stable severe COPD.
