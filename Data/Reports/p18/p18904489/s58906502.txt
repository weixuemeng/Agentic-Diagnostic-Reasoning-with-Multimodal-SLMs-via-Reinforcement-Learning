                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset epigastric pain with distended abdomen.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The aorta remains tortuous but unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities in the left lung base may reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacity left lung base is nonspecific, and may reflect an area
 of atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration however cannot be completely
 excluded.
