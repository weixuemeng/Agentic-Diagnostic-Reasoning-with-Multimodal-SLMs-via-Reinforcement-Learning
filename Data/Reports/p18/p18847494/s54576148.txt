 INDICATION:  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 Right-sided PICC is again seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  The
 heart is enlarged.  The central pulmonary vessels remain prominent, but less
 so since ___, with no associated edema.  Tiny bilateral pleural
 effusions are present, improved on the left.  The aorta is moderately
 calcified and tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis has
 improved, particularly at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Continued decrease in central pulmonary vascular prominence.  No edema.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, with interval improvement on the left.
 3.  Improved bibasilar atelectasis, particularly at the left base.
