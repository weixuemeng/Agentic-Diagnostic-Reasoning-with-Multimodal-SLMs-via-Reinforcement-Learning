                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities within the left lung base
 may represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Atelectasis has
 a non-specific appearance though can sometimes be a finding in acute pulmonary
 embolism in a patient presenting with chest pain.  Aspiration or pneumonia are
 also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  The remainder of the lungs
 are clear.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe, probably subsegmental
 atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical context, this may represent
 focal pneumonia or aspiration. 
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings to Dr. ___ at 8:01
 am on ___ by telephone.
