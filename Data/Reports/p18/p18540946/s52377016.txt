                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Generalized weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiac and hilar contours. Seen only on the lateral view, a slight convesity
 of the ascending aorta may reflect senile tortuosity but aneurysm is a
 consideration. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present. 
 Mild lobulated contour of the right hemidiaphragm may reflect eventration. 
 Mild central compression deformities of the mid thoracic spine are
 age-indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings concerning for pneumonia.  Age-indeterminate mid
 thoracic mild compression deformities. Seen only on the lateral view, convex
 border of ascending aorta may reflect normal senile tortuosity but ascending
 aorta dilatation is a consideration.  If clinically warranted could be further
 assessed with echocardiogram or CT.
