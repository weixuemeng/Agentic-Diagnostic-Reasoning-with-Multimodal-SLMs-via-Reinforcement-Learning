 ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, heart size and mediastinum appears to be
 stable.  Extensive interstitial opacities in the lung bases are present but
 slightly improved in the right lower lung.  Right upper lobe more nodular
 opacity appears to be unchanged.  No new abnormalities demonstrated.  Old rib
 fractures are noted on the left.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval stability of widespread interstitial opacities, nodular opacities,
 rib fractures as well as cardiomediastinal silhouette.
