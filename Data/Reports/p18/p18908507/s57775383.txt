 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 There are increased interstitial markings with hyperinflation and
 emphysematous changes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, greater
 on the left, with adjacent left basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left, with adjacent left
 basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis though infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  Emphysema with chronic interstitial lung disease.
