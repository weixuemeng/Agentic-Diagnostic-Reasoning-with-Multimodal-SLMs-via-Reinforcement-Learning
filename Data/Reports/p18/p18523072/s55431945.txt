                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracotomy, evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the loculated
 right pleural effusion is unchanged.  In addition, an air-fluid level is seen
 in the retrosternal lung region.  This finding is indicative for a substantial
 amount of free pleural ventral air.  The second air-fluid level is seen in the
 region of the lung apex.  The pleural effusion causes mild-to-moderate
 atelectasis.
 
 The pre-existing right soft tissue air collection has almost completely
 resolved.
 
 On the left, the lung appears normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
