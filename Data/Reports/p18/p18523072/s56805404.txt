                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right lower lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___ and CT chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rightward mediastinal and cardiac shift reflect a small decrease in
 volume of the right hemithorax, but right lung volume is approximately
 unchanged secondary due to decrease in small right pneumothorax and
 concomitant increase in small right pleural effusion.  The left lung is
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal, but larger today. There is no pulmonary
 edema or vascular congestion. Subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged in quantity,
 but different in distribution. A linear right lower lung opacity is probably
 atelectasis.  Two right chest tubes are unchaned, one in the apex, the other
 in the base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax reduced in volume, small right pleural
 effusion incresed, right lung volume stable.
