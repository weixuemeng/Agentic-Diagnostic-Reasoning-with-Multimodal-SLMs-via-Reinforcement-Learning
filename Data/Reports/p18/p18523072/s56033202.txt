  Compared to the CT chest from ___, opacities at bilateral lung bases
  likely represent extensive metastatic lung cancer. Flattening of the
  diaphragms bilaterally is likely a function of prior lung resection. No good
  evidence for pleural effusion. No strong evidence for new pneumonia. -___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma since ___ s/p RLL
 resection and chemotherapy with recurrence in ___ now on chemotherapy with
 leukocytosis and crackles on exam. ?PNA  // ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiograph is ___, but the study
 is actually read in conjunction with a a series of chest CT scans most
 recently ___ and ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple the right lower lobe lung masses are stable since ___.  Large
 consolidative abnormality and multiple lung nodules in the left lower lobe,
 also unchanged.  Although the peripheral consolidation in the left lower lobe
 has the characteristics of pneumonia, it is relatively long course, since
 ___ indicates it is more likely adenocarcinoma of the lung. As such,
 there are no findings to suggest acute pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion
 is long-standing. Patient has very severe emphysema. The heart is normal size
 there is no indication of cardiac decompensation.
