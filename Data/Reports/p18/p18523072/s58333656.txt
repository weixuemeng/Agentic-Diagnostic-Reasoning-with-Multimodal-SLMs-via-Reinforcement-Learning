                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after right lower lobe
 lobectomy.  
 
 PA and LAT radiographs were reviewed.
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph there is improved aeration of the right
 lung with decrease in pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable with expected right mediastinal shift.  Left
 lung is essentially clear.  Substantial emphysema is redemonstrated.
