                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New fevers in a patient with pneumonia despite
 therapy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval progression of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe
 consolidation.  There is interval development of a central lucency in the
 right perihilar consolidations that is highly worrisome for interval
 progression to necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess.  There is substantial
 increase in the pleural effusion.  There is also progression of left lower
 lobe opacities.
 
 There is new PICC line placement with its tip most likely projecting at the
 level of cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval progression of right lung consolidation highly worrisome for
 necrotizing pneumonia/lung abscess in conjunction with known emphysema. 
 Interval progression of pleural effusion.
