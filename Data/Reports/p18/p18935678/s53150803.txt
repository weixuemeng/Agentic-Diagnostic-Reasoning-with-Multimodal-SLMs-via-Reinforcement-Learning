                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue and chills.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.
 There is a patchy left-sided perihilar opacification and even greater opacity
 in the right perihilar region and along the right cardiophrenic angle,
 worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate setting.  Mild perihilar fullness
 also suggests slight superimposed congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the epigastric region.  Small
 anterior osteophytes are present along the thoracic spine.  Mild rightward
 convex curvature along the mid thoracic spine with small degenerative
 osteophytes appears similar.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy focal central opacities; the appearance suggests a
 component of mild congestion, but there is heterogeneity and asymmetry of
 opacities suggesting that there may be coinciding pneumonia.  Clinical
 correlation is suggested.
