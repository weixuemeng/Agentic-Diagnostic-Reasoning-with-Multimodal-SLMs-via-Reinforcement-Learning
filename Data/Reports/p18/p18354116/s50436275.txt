 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Ankle fracture, preop radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Calcifications are noted in
 the right paratracheal region which appeared to represent vascular
 calcifications, less likely calcified granulomas.  Calcification is noted at
 the costochondral junctions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
