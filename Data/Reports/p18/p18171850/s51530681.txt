                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening SOB, recent CXR with recent ?
 air fluid levels in RLL, pls re-eval.  PLEASE DO UPRIGHT (last film was
 semi-upright)  // eval for signs of abcess, hydropneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 230
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left.  There is volume
 loss in both lower lungs.  A few air bronchograms are seen on the right. 
 There is fluid in the right major fissure.  The air-fluid level seen on the
 prior study is no longer as evident.  It could have just been fluid in the
 fissure rather than a hydro pneumothorax.  The right central line is
 unchanged.  The upper lungs are clear
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No air-fluid level to suggest hydro pneumothorax.  The previous appearance was
 likely due to fluid in the major fissure
