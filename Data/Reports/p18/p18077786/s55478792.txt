  Lung volumes are lower than on prior. Right basilar opacity may represent
  atelectasis or aspiration. Mild left basilar atelectasis. Widening of the
  mediastinum is likely due to lower lung volumes and patient position. This
  could be re-assessed with upright radiograph and better inspiration if
  clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly occurred
 right basal opacity that could represent either atelectasis or aspiration. 
 Overall, the lung volumes have decreased.  There is no pleural effusion, but
 mild fluid overload might be present.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
