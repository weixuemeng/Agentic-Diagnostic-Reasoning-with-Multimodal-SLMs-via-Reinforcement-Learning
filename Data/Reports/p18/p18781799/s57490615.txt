                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with probable lung cancer now with probable
 metastases to brain.  // assess interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with a left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal
 contour is unchanged with widening of the superior mediastinum due to a
 combination of the patient's known right lower paraitracheal/suprahilar mass
 and lipomatosis as seen on the prior PET-CT. Fullness of the right hilum is
 compatible with hilar adenopathy. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Abnormal mediastinal contour is attributable to the presence of the patient's
 known right lower paratracheal/ suprahilar mass as well as lipomatosis as seen
 on the prior PET-CT. Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better appreciated
 on the prior PET-CT. Right hilar enlargement compatible with adenopathy.
