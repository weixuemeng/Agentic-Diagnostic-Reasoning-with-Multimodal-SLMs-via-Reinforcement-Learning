                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, sickle cell crisis, pulmonary emboli, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is cardiomegaly, with upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There are
 patchy increased interstitial markings at both lung bases, similar but
 slightly more pronounced than on ___ at 19:33 p.m.  Minimal blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, without other evidence of effusion. Increased
 density in the right infrahilar area may include opacity related to the
 patient's right paraspinal mass, which was attributed to extramedullary
 hematopoiesis on recent CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  CHF with interstitial edema, similar to ___.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities at both bases, similar but slightly worse compared with
 ___.  These could represent atelectasis or scarring, though the
 possibility of infectious infiltrate, cannot be excluded.
