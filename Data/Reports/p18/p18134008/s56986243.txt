                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could be due to atelectasis and
 aspiration, although infectious process is not excluded.  No large pleural
 effusions are seen, although a trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.
 There is lucency under the left hemidiaphragm, difficult to discern whether
 intraluminal or extraluminal/free air.  There may have been a similar lucency
 under the left hemidiaphragm on chest radiograph from ___, although this
 is difficult to accurately compare.  Findings can be further evaluated on
 lateral decubitus view or CT to further evaluate concern for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar
 opacities, could be due to aspiration and/or infection along with atelectasis.
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 2.  Lucency under the left hemidiaphragm, difficult to discern whether
 intraluminal or extraluminal/free air, but there is concern for
 pneumoperitoneum.  Findings can be further evaluated with lateral decubitus
 view or CT.
