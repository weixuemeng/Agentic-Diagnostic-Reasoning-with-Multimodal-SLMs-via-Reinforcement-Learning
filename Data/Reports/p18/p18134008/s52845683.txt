                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis and history of CLL,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is retrocardiac opacity that likely reflects patient's known hiatal
 hernia.  However, there is an asymmetric right infrahilar opacity when
 compared to the prior exam.  This likely reflects infection versus aspiration.
 There are bilateral interstital opacites present as well.   No pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.  The heart is slightly enlarged.  Mitral
 annular calcifications noted.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  There is
 no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Partial visualization of plate and screw
 fixation of the left humerus is seen fixating the surgical neck fracture of
 the humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in right infrahilar opacity concerning for infection
 versus aspiration.  Follow up radiography may be helpful to confirm this;
 however, this appearance may be part of a more generalized pattern of
 pulmonary edema without an additional process.
 
 2.  Findingsl consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
