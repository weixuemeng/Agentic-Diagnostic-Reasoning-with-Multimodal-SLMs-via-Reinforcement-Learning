                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest, portable semi-erect.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate positioning of right internal jugular central venous
 line in a patient status post repair of perforated pyloric ulcer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 passes through the esophagus, into the stomach, and terminates inferiorly at
 of the field of view.  A right internal jugular central venous line terminates
 in the low SVC.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The right lung is clear.  There is a left
 lung opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm which may reflect atelectasis,
 pleural effusion, pneumonia, or some combination thereof.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Dense atherosclerotic
 calcifications in the aortic arch are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The right internal jugular central venous line terminates in the low SVC.
 2. Left lower lobe opacity which may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia, small
 pleural effusion, or some combination thereof.
