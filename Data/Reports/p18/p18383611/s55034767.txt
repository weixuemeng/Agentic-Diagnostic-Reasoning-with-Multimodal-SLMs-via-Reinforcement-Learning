                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  History of elevated hemidiaphragm and recent aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD
 device is in place with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle
 and coronary sinus, respectively.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged.  Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. 
 Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is present.  There are
 streaky linear opacities in the left lower lobe, which are not entirely
 specific, but could be seen with atelectasis.  Patchy medial right basilar
 opacity in association with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is suggestive
 of atelectasis.  A few probably colonic air-fluid levels are noted in the
 upper abdomen.
 
 BONE WINDOWS:  The bones appear demineralized.  Mild-to-moderate degenerative
 changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, probably compatible with atelectasis, although
 pneumonia is difficult to entirely exclude.  The findings are not very typical
 of aspiration pneumonia.
 
 2.  Nonspecific air-fluid levels in the right upper quadrant, probably
 colonic.
 
 3.  Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 4.  Enlarged main pulmonary artery, which may be associated with pulmonary
 hypertension.
