                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with questionable TBC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  The heart is top normal in size, which is exaggerated by the low
 lung volumes.  There is no evidence of tuberculosis.  Aeration of the right
 lung base is suboptimal as compared to the left, and some crowding versus
 atelectasis is seen in this region. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of tuberculosis.  
 
 2.  Low lung volumes, with possible crowding versus atelectasis at the right
 lung base.  Consider repeat chest x-ray examination with increased inspiratory
 volumes for additional evaluation.
