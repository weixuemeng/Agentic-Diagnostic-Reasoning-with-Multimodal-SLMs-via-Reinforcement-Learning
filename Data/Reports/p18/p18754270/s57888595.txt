                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary htn  // Pre VQ scan baseline
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, and chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no significant interval change since ___.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities are consistent with underlying fibrotic lung disease,
 better demonstrated on prior cross-sectional imaging.  No new consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal widening is likely due to known
 lymphadenopathy, better demonstrated on the prior chest CTA dated ___. 
 Slight asymmetry in the breast tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change with pulmonary fibrosis related to known interstitial
 lung disease and mediastinal and hilar prominence likely reflecting known
 lymphadenopathy.
