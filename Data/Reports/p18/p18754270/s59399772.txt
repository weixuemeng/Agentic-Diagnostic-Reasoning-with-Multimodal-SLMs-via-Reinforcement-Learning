                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lung biopsy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again evidence of
 diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease with continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The areas of increased opacification seen previously that
 may have been due to procedural hemorrhage are not seen at this time.  No
 definite focal pneumonia is evident, though this could be difficult to detect
 given the substrate of chronic pulmonary disease.
