                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea, bibasilar crackles, PMHx pulm htn, new
 worsening o2 requirement  // eval pulm edema, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged cardiac size. 
 Increased diffuse bilateral opacity suggests mild pulmonary edema superimposed
 on known underlying interstitial lung disease.  No definite focal
 consolidation is identified, although difficult to evaluate given overlying
 opacity.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Surgical clips project over the
 left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on known underlying interstitial lung
