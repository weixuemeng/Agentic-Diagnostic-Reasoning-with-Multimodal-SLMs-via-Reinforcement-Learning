                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with hypoxia  // eval for pneumonia, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs with particular
 subpleural distribution.  There may have been interval progression of disease
 at the right lung base although superimposed infection would be difficult to
 exclude.  Elsewhere, there has been no significant interval change since prior
 chest x-ray.  Similar appearance of the hila with possible underlying
 adenopathy as seen on prior chest CT.  Surgical clips project over the left
 axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial disease in the lungs as seen on prior chest CT.  Opacity
 at the right lung base appears to have progressed which could be progression
 of lung disease although superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.
