                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New chest tube, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the two pigtail catheters
 were removed and a new chest tube was inserted on the left.  The left lung is
 substantially better expanded than on the previous image.  An area of
 atelectasis persists in the mid and low left lung regions.  Miniscule
 pneumothorax is still evident at the left lung base ascending the
 paramediastinal left lung areas.  No evidence of tension.  Unchanged
 appearance of the right lung.
