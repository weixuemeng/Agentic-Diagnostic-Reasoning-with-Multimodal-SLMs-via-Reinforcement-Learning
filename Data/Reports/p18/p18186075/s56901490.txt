                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New onset seizures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  There is moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with
 overlying atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight prominence of the right hilum may
 relate to patient's elevated right hemidiaphragm and subsequent lower volume
 of the right lung.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes is not enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Retrocardiac density with lucency within seen both on the frontal
 and lateral views likely represents a large hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large hiatal hernia.
 2.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No definite focal consolidation.
