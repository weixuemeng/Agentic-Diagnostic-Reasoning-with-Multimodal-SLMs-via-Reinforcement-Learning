                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in similar position with
 leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  There is
 similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Lung volumes are
 moderately low.  Seen on the lateral view only is patchy streaky opacity
 projecting over the lower posterior lungs, probably within the left lower
 lobe, most suggestive of minor atelectasis or scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Small-to-moderate osteophytes are similar throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity, probably compatible with atelectasis
 or scarring, perhaps in association with spinal osteophytes.  Although less
 likely, an infectious etiology is difficult to completely exclude, however.
