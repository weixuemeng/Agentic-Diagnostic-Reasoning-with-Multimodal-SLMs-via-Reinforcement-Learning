                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Loss of consciousness, seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with the distal end of the study
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Only seen on the lateral
 view, there is patchy streaky opacity projecting over the lower posterior
 lungs, similar to that seen on ___, which may represent atelectasis
 or scarring, not seen on the frontal view.  Findings could also be related in
 part to adjacent osteophytes.  No definite focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky opacity projecting over the lower lung fields on the lateral view, not
 seen on the frontal view, similar appearance to chest radiographs from ___, may relate to atelectasis/scarring and possibly adjacent
 osteophytes.
