                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 patchy left base retrocardiac opacity worrisome for pneumonia or possibly
 aspiration.  Additionally, there is subtle right upper lobe opacity in similar
 distribution as the frank consolidation seen on prior radiograph which may be
 due to underlying scarring or, as on chest CT from ___, the patient had
 underlying chronic regional right upper lobe interstitial infiltration with
 mild bronchiectasis, chronic.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
