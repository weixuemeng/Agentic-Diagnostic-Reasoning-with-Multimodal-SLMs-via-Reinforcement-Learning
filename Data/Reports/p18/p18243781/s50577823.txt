                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough  // Rule out infiltrate    
 Rule out infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  There is unchanged evidence of a hiatal
 hernia.  In the right lung apex, at the same location where the rounded
 opacity was present in ___, there is now a larger ill-defined
 parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms and a slightly rounded shape.  The
 lesion is better seen on the frontal than on the lateral radiograph.  Although
 recurrent pneumonia would be a possible differential diagnosis, CT should be
 performed to exclude the presence of a growing neoplasm.
 No larger pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the heart.  No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT must be performed to exclude the presence of a growing
 right upper lobe neoplasm.
