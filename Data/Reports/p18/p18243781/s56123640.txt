                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of pneumonia  // follow up film     
 follow up film
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Interstitial opacities in the right
 upper lobe are similar to previous examination.  Left basal consolidation is
 similar as well, in part representing hiatal hernia abuts and part infectious
 process.  Giving the lack of resolution of the findings repeated assessment
 with chest CT is required.
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT for assessment of unchanged opacities in the
 right upper and left lower lobe and potentially right lower lobe as well.
