                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation in the field.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 5.5 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube tip
 courses below the diaphragm into the stomach, off the inferior borders of the
 film.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There are mild bibasilar
 opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax though the extreme lung apices are excluded from the field of
 view.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal and orogastric tube tips in standard positions.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.
