                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with seizure disorder status post gastric bypass
 and pituitary resection with mid left back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 When compared to prior, the previously seen tubing presumably from VP shunt
 along the right chest wall is no longer visualized.  Streaky bibasilar
 opacities more so on the right are suggestive of atelectasis.  There is
 blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle potentially due to small
 effusion or pleural thickening.  There is no acute confluent consolidation. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Linear opacities most suggestive of atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening.
 
 Previously seen VP shunt catheter along the right chest wall is no longer
 visualized.
