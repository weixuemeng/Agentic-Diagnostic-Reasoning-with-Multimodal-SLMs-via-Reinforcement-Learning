                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with weight loss and a smoking history.  Evaluate
 possible mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph, ___:
 
 Some asymmetry in the shape and radiodensity of the costosternal process of
 the second ribs warrants a lordotic view although I doubt that a lung lesion
 is present.  Lungs are otherwise entirely clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
