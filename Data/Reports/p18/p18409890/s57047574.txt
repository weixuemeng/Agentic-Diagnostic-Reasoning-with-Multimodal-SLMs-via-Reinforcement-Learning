 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued opacification
 in the infrahilar regions bilaterally, possibly worse on the left, consistent
 with the diagnosis of multifocal aspiration or pneumonia.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen.  This could reflect some improving pleural
 effusion, but may merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the
 patient.
