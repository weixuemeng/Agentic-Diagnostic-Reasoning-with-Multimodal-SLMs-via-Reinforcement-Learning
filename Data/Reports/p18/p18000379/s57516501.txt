                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ WITH COMPARISON RADIOGRAPH OF EARLIER THE
 SAME DATE
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a persistent small
 right apical pneumothorax.  Visceral apical pleural line is at the level of
 the fourth posterior rib level, similar to the prior radiograph, allowing for
 slight positional differences.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance in the postoperative period.  Multifocal atelectasis in the right
 mid and both lower lung regions is unchanged.
