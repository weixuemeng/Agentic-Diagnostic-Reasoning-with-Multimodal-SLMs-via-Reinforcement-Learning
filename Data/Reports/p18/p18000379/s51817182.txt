                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral and tricuspid
 valve replacements after discontinuation of the right chest tube.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval increase in still small right
 apical pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis in the right middle lobe is
 redemonstrated.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen on the left, but there is
 most likely present subcutaneous air again that might reflect the superimposed
 structures and the next radiograph should be obtained with attention to no
 superimposed structures projecting over the left upper chest.
