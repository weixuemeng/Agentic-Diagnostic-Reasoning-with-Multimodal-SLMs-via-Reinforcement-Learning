                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest tube on waterseal.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 There is interval development of a small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax
 after placement of the chest tube on waterseal as demonstrated on the current
 AP chest radiograph.  The rest of the findings including mild cardiomegaly,
 mild mediastinal air, as well as unremarkable appearance of sternotomy wires
 is redemonstrated.  Minimal amount of left apical pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded.
