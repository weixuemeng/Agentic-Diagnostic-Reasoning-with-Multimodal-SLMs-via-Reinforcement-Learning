                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea for 3 days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  A 3.5 x 5.7 cm right
 paratracheal well-circumscribed mass is identified, as well as a 5.5 x 3.1 cm
 left paramediastinal lesion. The trachea appears slightly narrowed as a result
 of these masses. Hilar contours are unremarkable, and no pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.  S-shaped scoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral paramediastinal masses, likely reflecting an enlarged thyroid
 goiter, with mild tracheal narrowing, but further assessment with chest CT
 with IV contrast is recommended.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration are not excluded.
