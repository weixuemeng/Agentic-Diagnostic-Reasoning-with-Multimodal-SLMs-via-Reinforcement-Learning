                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GI bleed, now with NG tube reposition  //
 NG tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection, semi-erect positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray dated ___ at 03:28.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is in unchanged position, terminating 2.8 cm above the carina. 
 There has been interval advancement of previously visualized NG tube, with
 distal tip now in the stomach and side port just distal to the GE junction.
 
 The cardio mediastinal contours are stable.  The bilateral hila stable in
 appearance.
 
 There has been mild interval improvement in interstitial opacities as compared
 to the radiograph taken at 03:28, most prominently in the left upper lobe,
 suggesting improvement in pulmonary edema.
 
 There is also development of an apparent haziness of the right hemidiaphragm
 which, in the setting of poor inspiratory effort low lung volumes, is likely
 crowding of vascular structures at the right lung base secondary to
 atelectasis; however, especially in the setting of NG tube insertion and
 repositioning, this may also represent interval aspiration.  Attention to this
 area on next/ repeat chest x-ray.  Similarly, there is also stable
 retrocardiac opacification which likely represents left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval repositioning of NG tube with distal tip in the stomach and side
 port distal to GE junction.
 2.  Mild interval improvement pulmonary edema as compared to radiograph at
 03:28.
 3. Right basilar atelectasis versus aspiration.  Attention to this area on
 repeat chest x-ray.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Interval repositioning of NG tube was discussed over the phone
 by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:00, at the time of
 discovery.
