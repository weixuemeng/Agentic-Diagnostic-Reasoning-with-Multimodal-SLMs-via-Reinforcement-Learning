                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with outside hospital chest radiograph of a right
 upper lobe opacity.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 7:53 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  The lungs again demonstrate an ill-defined opacity
 projecting over the right upper lobe, similar in extent to prior exam.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No cavitary lesions or calcifications
 are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe pneumonia - its appearance is nonspecific with
 regards to causative agent, so if TB is a concern clinically, isolation and
 correlation with sputum would be advised.
