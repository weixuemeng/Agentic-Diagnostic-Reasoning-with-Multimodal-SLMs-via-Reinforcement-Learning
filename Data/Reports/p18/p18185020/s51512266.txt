 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low.  The

 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with anterior osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
