                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease with prior stents and coronary bypass graft
 surgery, presenting with unsteady gait, altered mental status and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 vascular stent projects along the aortopulmonary window.  There is also a
 vascular stent projecting immediately above the aorta, perhaps along the
 course of the left carotid artery.  Chain suture material projects along the
 right costophrenic sulcus.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis is noted at the left base.  Mild
 degenerative changes are noted along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
