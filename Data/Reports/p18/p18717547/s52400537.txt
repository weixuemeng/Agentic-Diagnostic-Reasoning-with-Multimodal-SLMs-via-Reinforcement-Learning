                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular
 crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Within this
 limitation, there is streaky opacification of the right lung base most
 compatible with atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is likely
 enlarged. The thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes with right basilar opacity likely representing
 atelectasis.
