                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right shoulder pain, occipital headache, and
 right middle finger pain with swelling status post fall?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Focal convexity
 inferior to the aortic arch at the level of the AP window could reflect a
 vascular structure such as a pseudoaneurysm, or other mediastinal mass.  Hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Streaky opacities are seen within the retrocardiac region with tram tracking
 suggestive of bronchiectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are noted
 posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal convexity inferior to the aortic arch at the level of the AP window
 may reflect a vascular structure or other mediastinal lesion, and further
 assessment with contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
 2. Streaky opacities in the retrocardiac region which tracking suggestive of
 bronchiectasis.
