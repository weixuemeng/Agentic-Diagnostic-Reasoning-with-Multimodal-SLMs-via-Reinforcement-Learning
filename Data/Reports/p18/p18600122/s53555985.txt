                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple fractures after bike accident,
 assess for interval change in left effusion and vascular congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea.  Right subclavian
 catheter has been introduced and terminates in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach with side hole just beyond the GE junction.  Moderate
 left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
 are increased.  Fullness in the hila and indistinctness of pulmonary
 vasculature suggests perhaps mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  Known rib fractures are not as well assessed on this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in moderate left and small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusions with unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
