                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:39 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple trauma, on positive pressure
 ventilation, with known pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 1:30 p.m.:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and increased caliber of previously normal size heart and
 pulmonary hila reflect volume resuscitation and relative cardiac
 insufficiency.  The left-sided rib fractures are more displaced now than
 earlier, but pleural effusion, if present, is only small, and I see no
 appreciable pneumothorax.  The ET tube is in standard placement and
 nasogastric tube ends above the level of the carina.
