                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval in vascular congestion/edema.   The patient
 has a history of trauma with left hemopneumothorax and multiple fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  The most recent chest radiograph from ___ and a series
 of older studies dating back to admission radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP bedside radiograph demonstrates markedly low lung volumes. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, when followed over time, particularly from
 ___ to today's study, shows steady progressive enlargement,
 particularly of the right contour.  This raises concern for an enlarging
 mediastinal fluid collection or hematoma.  Mild cardiomegaly which is
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema persists, as well as more prominent
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  An endotracheal tube lies 1.3 cm above the
 carina, and although the neck is flexed, the tube should be withdrawn by at
 least 1 cm to ensure proper positioning.  An NG tube courses into the stomach
 and inferiorly out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Progressive widening of the mediastinum raises concern for mediastinal
 hematoma or fluid collection given the patient's history of trauma.  If there
 is clinical suspicion for this occurrence, a CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 2.  Stable mild congestive heart failure.
 3.  The endotracheal tube should be withdrawn by at least 1 cm to ensure
 proper positioning.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone
 on ___ at 9:55 a.m., immediately after discovery.
