                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Previously noted right lower
 lobe patchy ill-defined opacity has improved.  Previously described nodular
 opacity measuring 12 mm projecting over the right mid lung field may reflect
 the end of the right anterior 6th rib.  Left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Resolving right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 2. Previously described 12 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid
 lung field may reflect the end of the anterior right 6th rib.  Oblique views
 can be obtained for further evaluation as suggested previously.
