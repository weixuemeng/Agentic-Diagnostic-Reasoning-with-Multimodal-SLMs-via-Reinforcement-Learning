                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status  // ? acute cardipulm
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion with mild edema.  Likely small bilateral effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Bibasilar patchy opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and small pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but
 repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more
 complete assessment of these findings when the patient's condition permits.  .
