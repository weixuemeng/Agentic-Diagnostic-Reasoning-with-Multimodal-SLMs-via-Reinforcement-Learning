                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is new crowded appearance
 of the pulmonary vasculature with hazy infiltrate in the right lower lobe
 posterior segment consistent with early pneumonia.  The previously suspected
 nodular infiltrate in the right mid lung is not identified on this exam;
 however, recommend followup exam to ensure resolution of current opacity and
 further evaluate previously seen nodular infiltrate.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax are present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New right lower lobe posterior segment early pneumonia. Previous exam
 recommended oblique films to evaluate suspected nodular infiltrate which is
 not seen on this film; however, recommend follow up exam to ensure resolution
 of current pneumonia and further evaluate the previously seen nodular
 infiltrate.
