                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pleuritic chest pain.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There are low lung
 volumes, unchanged from prior.  There is increase in the interstitial markings
 more so in the lower lobes bilaterally.  These raise a possibility of
 interstitial lung disease.  If clinically indicated, CT can be performed for
 further evaluation.  There is no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
