                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of lung cancer
 and pleural effusion, now with cough and dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Left mediastinal shift is unchanged.  Left basal and apical pleural effusion
 appear to be slightly increased since the prior study.  Left lower lobe
 consolidation has slightly increased.  The left mid lung and right lung are
 essentially clear except for unchanged chronic linear opacities.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Overall, the findings might represent interval development of
 left lower lobe new process, potentially infectious, please correlate
 clinically.
