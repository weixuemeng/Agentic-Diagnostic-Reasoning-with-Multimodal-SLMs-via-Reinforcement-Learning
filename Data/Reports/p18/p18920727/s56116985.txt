                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with non-small cell lung cancer. 
 Study requested for evaluation of tumor burden and progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___,
 pleural density on the left is somewhat increased and is obliterating the left
 hemidiaphragm.  It is difficult to say if there is overlying pleural effusion
 or if the lung is being encased by chronic or malignant changes.  There is
 moderate further loss of left-sided lung volumes, although the upper portions
 of the left lung are aerated. The right lung remains aerated, but there is a
 small pleural effusion in the right and posterior pleural sinuses.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased pleural density on the left with interval decrease of left lung
 volume.
 
 2.  New small right pleural effusion.
