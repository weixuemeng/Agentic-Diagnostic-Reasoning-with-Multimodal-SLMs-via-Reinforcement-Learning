                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer with chest pain.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT chest from ___.  The exam was reported after a subsequent CT of the chest was obtained
 today on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there appears to be increased opacification
 at the left base.  When compared to the subsquent CT, this is likely due to
 increasing atelectasis, predominantly in the lingula.  There is a moderate
 left pleural effusion which is stable.  There is a small right effusion.  The
 left apex and right lung are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is
 difficult to evaluate given the surrounding opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification of the left base, likely due to a
 combination of a stable pleural effusion and increasing atelectasis.  These
 abnormalities are better characterized on the subsequent CT.
