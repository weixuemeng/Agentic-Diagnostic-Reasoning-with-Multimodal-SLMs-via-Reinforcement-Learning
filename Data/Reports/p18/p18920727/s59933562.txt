                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with Pleurx, VATS, decreasing oxygen
 saturation, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the
 same day.  The female patient with history of lung cancer, is status post VATS
 procedure with left pleurodesis and Pleurx catheter placement.  Comparison of
 the present portable chest examination demonstrates grossly unchanged position
 of a previously described left-sided pleural catheter.  The pleural density
 along the lateral and apical chest wall has increased.  Also noted is an air
 distended stomach with elevated right atrium, a factor, which may contribute
 to the patient's overall poor respiratory condition.  As before, low pulmonary
 volumes are seen.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest tube remains in place, increasing evidence of pleural
 densities surrounding the left hemithorax.  Poor inspirational lung volume, as
 before.  No pneumothorax.
