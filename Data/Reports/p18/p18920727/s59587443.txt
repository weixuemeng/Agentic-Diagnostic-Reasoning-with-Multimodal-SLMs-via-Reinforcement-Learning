                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with non-small cell lung cancer and
 known pleural effusions.  Evaluate for worsening tumor progression versus
 heart failure. Dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the similar PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  Comparison of the frontal views
 indicates a lesser inspirational volume and generally higher positioned
 diaphragms.  The previously described pleural thickening surrounding the left
 lung remains rather unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature in the right
 hemithorax does not disclose typical pattern for cardiogenic pulmonary
 congestion.  Scattered nodular densities in the right lung highly suggestive
 of secondary metastases.  Comparison of the lateral views discloses increase
 of pleural effusion accumulating in the left lower pleural space.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of increasing pleural effusion on the left side.No
 significant pulmonary vascular congestion as observed in the right hemithorax
 does not favor diagnosis of heart failure.
