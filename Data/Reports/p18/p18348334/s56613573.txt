 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding along the
 thoracic aorta.  Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic arch.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear. 
 Small-to-moderate anterior partly flowing anterior osteophytes are present
 along several lower thoracic levels, but the vertebral body heights and
 interspaces appear preserved.  Slight rightward convex curvature is oriented
 toward the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
