                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Progressively worsening productive cough
 with right-sided posterior chest discomfort associated with fevers and
 myalgias  // please evaluate for pneumonia     please evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  .  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lateral view suggests a very small region of abnormal Lung at one of the
 bases, probably the right.  I hesitate to call this pneumonia since the
 inspiration is less than complete.  If more radiographic certainty is needed
 to decide whether tube treat pneumonia, repeat lateral view at full
 inspiration should be obtained, supplemented by oblique views if necessary.
 
 
 Upper lungs are clear.  Heart is normal size and there is no pleural effusion
 or evidence of central lymph node enlargement
