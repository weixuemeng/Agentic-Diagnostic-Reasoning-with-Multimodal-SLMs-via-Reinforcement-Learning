                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Slight increased opacity at the right lung base, best seen on the frontal view
 may relate to atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting,
 infectious process is not excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Chest
 radiography is inappropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolism.  The aorta
 is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarge.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Hyperinflated lungs suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 2.  Slight increase in opacity at the right lung base may relate to
 atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting, infectious process
 is not excluded.
