                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Axillary access for pacemaker.  Please assess lead position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided pacemaker noted terminating in the right  ventricle;
 however, the right atrial lead is positioned laterally and the right heart
 border is not completely evident at this level.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pacemaker leads positioned in the right atrium and ventricle. 
 However, right atrial lead tip position cannot be clearly related to right
 heart border.  Finding likely reflects patient position though cannot exclude
 perforation. Could be further evaluated with repeat radiograph or noncontrast
 chest CT.
 
 ___ communicated these findings to Dr ___ at 17:40 on ___
 via telephone.
