                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Relative opacity projecting over the mid to lower thorax bilaterally most
 likely relates to overlying soft tissue although underlying pleural effusion
 or consolidation is difficult to exclude on this study.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly stable, with the cardiac silhouette top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal study due to patient body habitus.  Relative increased opacity
 projecting over the mid to lower thorax most likely relates to overlying soft
 tissue although underlying consolidation or pleural effusion is difficult to
 entirely exclude.  Top-normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
