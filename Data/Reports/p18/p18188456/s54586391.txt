                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 and the pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal interstitial opacities
 in lung bases may reflect chronic interstitial abnormality, as noted on the
 prior chest CT.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic interstitial lung abnormality
 at the lung bases persists, as better seen on prior CT.
