                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sarcoid with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.  Specifically, no hilar or mediastinal adenopathy or
 interstitial prominence to radiographically suggest sarcoidosis.
 
 There is a curious appearance of the medial cortex of the right humeral
 diaphysis.  Specific views of this region and the right shoulder are
 suggested, and any comparison studies that would contain this region should be
 urgently sought.
