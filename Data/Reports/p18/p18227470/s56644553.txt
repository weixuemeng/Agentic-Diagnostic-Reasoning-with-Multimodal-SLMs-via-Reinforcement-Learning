                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent falls, fever, leg pain  // eval for
 PNA      eval for PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the right base, but there is no
 evidence rib abnormality or pneumothorax.
 On the limited lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased
 opacification in the retrocardiac region, though this is not confirmed on the
 frontal projection.  Nevertheless, the possibility of pneumonia cannot be
 definitely excluded.
