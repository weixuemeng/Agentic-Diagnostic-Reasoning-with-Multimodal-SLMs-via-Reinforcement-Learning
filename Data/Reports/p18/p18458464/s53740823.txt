                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of remote TB, severe COPD with
 hemoptysis, question pneumonia or mass.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as CT chest
 from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is no significant
 interval change from the recent CT and chest radiographs.  Extensive fibrosis
 and upper lobe scarring is unchanged.  An ovoid density in the right mid lung
 corresponds to a calcification on prior CT.  There is slight upward retraction
 of the pulmonary hila, unchanged.  The heart and mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  No evidence of superimposed pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive scarring without superimposed pneumonia. Ovoid nodular opacity in
 the right mid lung corresponds with known calcification on prior CT.
