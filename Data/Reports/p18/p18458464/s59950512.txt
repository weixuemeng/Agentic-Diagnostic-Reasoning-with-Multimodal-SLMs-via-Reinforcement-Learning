                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hemoptysis, history of prior TB.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with evidence of severe emphysema, most pronounced in the right
 lung base.  Superior hilar retraction with biapical scarring, architectural
 distortion, and calcified granulomas are compatible with prior tuberculosis
 infection.  Diffuse bronchiectasis with airway wall thickening and ill-defined
 nodular opacities are compatible with the airways inflammation and/or
 infection, similar compared to the previous exam.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation are definitively noted.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings compatible with prior tuberculosis infection and diffuse
 bronchiectasis with evidence of airways inflammation or infection.  Severe
 emphysema.  No new areas of focal consolidation demonstrated.
