                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 about 4.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Streaky opacity
 at the right base suggests minor atelectasis, but otherwise there is better
 aeration, particularly at the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
