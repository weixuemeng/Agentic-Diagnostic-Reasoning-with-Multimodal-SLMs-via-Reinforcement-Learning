                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, in a patient with a history of asthma. Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two views of the chest demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 well-aerated lungs. Perihilar bronchial wall thickening could be consistent
 with a viral/ reactive airways process. Prominence of the hilar structures
 could potentially represent reactive lymphadenopathy or prominent vessels. No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar bronchial wall thickening, which could represent a viral/reactive
 airways process.  Prominence of the hilar structures could potentially
 represent reactive lymphadenopathy or prominent vessels. No focal
 consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.
