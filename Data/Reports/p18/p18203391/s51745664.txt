                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Epilepsy, difficulty feeding, query NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube coursing
 below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not well seen, but likely
 within the body of the stomach.  A right-sided PICC is seen, terminating in
 the proximal SVC and appears slightly withdrawn in position as compared to the
 prior study.  There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles may be due to low lung volumes, although trace
 pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  A battery pack overlies the
 lateral left lower hemithorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  No pneumothorax.
