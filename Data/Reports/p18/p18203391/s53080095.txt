                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Left
 lower chest implanted neurostimulator is again seen and obscures the left
 costophrenic angle.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Patchy left base
 retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration or infection not excluded.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen but trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Basilar atelectasis.  Subtle patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may be due
 to atelectasis, although an early consolidation due to aspiration or infection
 is not excluded.
