                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes with some decrease in the bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite evidence
 of acute focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
