                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent seizure activity, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. 
 
 Technique:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A device is again noted in the left hemi thorax with wires coursing toward the
 neck, which may represent a deep nerve stimulator.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes remain low.  On this single view, there is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Bibasilar opacities are most compatible with
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although potentially pneumonia
 or aspiration in the left mid to lower lung. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung
 volumes but likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits and unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy basilary opacities which are non-specific, increased; with low lung
 volumes atelectasis is perhaps most likely, but pneumonia and aspiration are
 additional potential etiologies.  Standard PA and lateral radiographs with
 good inspiration might be helpful for short-term follow-up if practical.
