                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased somnolence and cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are newly appeared
 bilateral parenchymal opacities.  These are better seen on the lateral than on
 the frontal radiographs and are both located in the lower lobes.  The
 opacities are ill-defined and show multiple air bronchograms as well as
 bronchocentric predominance.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the
 opacities are highly suggestive for pneumonia.
 
 At the time of dictation, the referring physician, ___. ___, was paged to
 notification, 12:18 p.m. on ___.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Unchanged left pectoral pacing
 devices, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
