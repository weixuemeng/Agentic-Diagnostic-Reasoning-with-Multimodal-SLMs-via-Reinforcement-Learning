                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epilepsy, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is suggestion of some
 more indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, some of which may merely reflect
 even lower lung volumes.  The possibility of worsening pulmonary vascular
 congestion should be considered.  Otherwise, little change from the previous
 study.
