                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male presenting with low-grade fever and
 desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Tracheostomy catheter and right approach
 PICC are in unchanged expected position.  A generator overlies the left chest
 wall, unchanged from prior.  There has been interval re-expansion of the right
 middle and bilateral lower lobes since most recent prior.  Mild atelectasis
 persists at the right base, though overall aeration is much improved.  Lung
 volumes remain low exaggerating bronchovascular markings, though there is
 probable mild pulmonary edema, though no large effusions.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits given the portable supine
 technique of the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Improved aeration right middle and lower lobes.
