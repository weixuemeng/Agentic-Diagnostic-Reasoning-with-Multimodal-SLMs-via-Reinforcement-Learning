                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Agitated with crackles at the bases.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Multiple wires external to the patient
 limits evaluation of the left lung base.  Heart size and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  Lung volumes remain very low.  Bibasilar opacities have slightly
 increased since the prior exam and are very symmetric with sharply distinct
 margins, entirely consistent with atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Very low lung volumes with slight interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis.
