 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturations, evaluation for respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  There is a new
 tracheostomy tube and a right PICC line in situ.  The lung volumes are low and
 areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases.  These are slightly more
 severe than on the previous examination.  However, there is no pulmonary
 edema, pneumonia or pneumothorax.  Larger pleural effusions are not present. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position of a pacemaker
 device projecting over the left costophrenic sinus.
