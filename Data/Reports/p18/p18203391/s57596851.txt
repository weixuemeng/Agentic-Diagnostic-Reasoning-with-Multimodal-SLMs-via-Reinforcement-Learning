                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated patient.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.3 cm above the level of the carina.  Enteric
 tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm and partially imaged
 coiled in the stomach.  A right-sided PICC is seen terminating in the
 proximal-to-mid SVC.  There are relatively low lung volumes in right greater
 than left bibasilar atelectasis.  Right base opacities again most likely due
 to atelectasis, although attention at followup advised.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Vagal nerve stimulator is also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.
 
 Likely bibasilar atelectasis.  Right base opacity is felt to most likely
 represent atelectasis; however, continued attention at followup.
