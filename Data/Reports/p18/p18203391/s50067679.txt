                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures. Rule out cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs. 
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval removal of a right sided PICC line. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits. Lung volumes remain decreased
 accentuating the bronchovascular structures. Bibasilar opacities likely
 represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A generator overlying the left chest wall,
 remains unchanged from prior examination. Note is made of chronic injury to
 the right distal clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
