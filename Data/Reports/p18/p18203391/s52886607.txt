                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Lethargy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Patient's chin obscures the right
 apex.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally increased.  Increasing
 opacities in the left lower lobe could be atelectasis but superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
