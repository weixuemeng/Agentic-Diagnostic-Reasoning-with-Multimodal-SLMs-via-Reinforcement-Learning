                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG and AVR.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mediastinal widening and perihilar opacification on the left have largely
 resolved. There is suspected minor atelectasis at the left lung base and
 probably small subpulmonic pleural effusions as well as thickening of
 fissures.  However, parenchymal edema has resolved.  The patient is status
 post coronary artery bypass graft surgery, aortic valve replacement, and
 placement of a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device. In addition, transcutaneous
 pacer leads remain still visible. Suture anchors are present in each humeral
 head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Decreased mediastinal widening. Resolution of pulmonary edema and decreased
 pleural effusions.
