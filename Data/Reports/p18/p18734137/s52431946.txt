                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pericardial effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged, increased
 compared to the previous radiograph.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No focal consolidation
 is identified.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen with scarring noted at the lung
 apices.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Increased size of the cardiac silhouette compatible with a history of
 pericardial effusion.  Correlation with echocardiogram is recommended.
 2. Trace right pleural effusion.
