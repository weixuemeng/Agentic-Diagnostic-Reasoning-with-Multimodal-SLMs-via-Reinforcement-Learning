                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post transplant, prior for multiple myeloma with
 fever to 102.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Streaky
 lateral left base opacities may be due to atelectasis, although infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The right lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Posterior cervicothoracic
 spinal fusion hardware and spacer grossly stable as compared to the prior
 study.  Osseous changes are better assessed on the CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy lateral left basilar opacity could relate to atelectasis,
 but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
