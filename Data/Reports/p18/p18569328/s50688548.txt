 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:49 PM
  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  No
  focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  A
  skin fold projecting over the right lateral chest simulates a pneumothorax. 
  Known left anterior rib soft tissue lesion is less apparent on the present
  study.
