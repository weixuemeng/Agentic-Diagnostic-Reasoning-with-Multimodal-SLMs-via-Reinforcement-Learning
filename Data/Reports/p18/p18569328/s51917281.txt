                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post bone marrow transplant with fever,
 diarrhea, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly
 tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky
 atelectasis is demonstrated in both lung bases, more pronounced on the left. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Known soft tissue lesion involving the
 left seventh anterolateral rib likely accounts for the somewhat triangular
 opacity projecting over the left costophrenic angle, better assessed on the
 previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes.
