                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is mildly tortuous without change. 
 Lungs are clear, and there are no pleural effusions.  Bones are demineralized,
 and note is made of post-operative changes in the upper thoracic spine as well
 as a mild compression deformity in the lower thoracic spine.  Healed lateral
 left rib fracture is unchanged, and may potentially be related to known
 history of myeloma.  More subtle healed right rib fractures are seen to better
 detail on recent PET-CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
