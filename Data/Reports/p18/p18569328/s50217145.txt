                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of multiple myeloma.  Evaluate prior to bone marrow
 transplant.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  There is no consolidation, pleural effusions,
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Again noted is hardware from a prior spinal
 fusion in the upper thoracic spine with a metallic cage at T3.  This is
 unchanged from prior exam.  The spine appears more lucent than expected, and
 is likely due to known multiple myeloma as shown on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
