                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post posterior spinal fusion of the upper thoracic spine
 with an interbody spacer.  There is a right-sided PICC line which terminates
 in the mid right atrium.  The lungs are well inflated.  Linear opacities at
 the left lung base and along the posterior aspect of the lungs on the lateral
 view are slightly worse compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but
 have a waxing and waning appearance over other prior imaging studies.  This
 could represent fluctuating atelectasis.  There is no strong evidence for
 pneumonia.  Osseous structures are intact.  Heart size and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid right atrium.
 2. Fluctuating opacities at the left lung base may represent atelectasis or a
 component of organizing pneumonia as was suggested on a prior CT.
 3. No strong evidence for pneumonia.
