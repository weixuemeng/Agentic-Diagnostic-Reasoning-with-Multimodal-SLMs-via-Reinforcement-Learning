                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ulcerative colitis
 after total colectomy with ileoanal pouch and ileus, confirm NG tube
 placement.
 
 AP view of the chest is focused on the mid and lower lungs and upper abdomen.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Dilated small bowel loops up to 6 cm are
 noted.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Small amount of intraperitoneal air is
 most likely consistent with recent laparotomy.
