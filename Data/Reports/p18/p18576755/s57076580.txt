 ADDENDUM  SEVERAL TYPE ALL HAVE OCCURRED DURING DICTATION OF THE PREVIOUS
 REPORT.  PLEASE READ THE REPORT AS FOLLOWING:
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. New right lower lung
 opacity is noted, most likely in the lingula, potentially representing
 infectious process but with element of atelectasis. No other abnormalities
 seen and the rest of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Assessment of the patient with chest CT is to be considered for presize
 characterization of the abnormality and to exclude the possibility of post
 obstructing pneumonia giving the appearance of the finding on the chest
 radiograph.
