 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 An ___ x 8 mm calcified granuloma is noted in the left lingula, which is
 similar in appearance to the most recent prior study.  Mild increased opacity
 in the infrahilar region on the lateral radiograph likely reflects
 atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
