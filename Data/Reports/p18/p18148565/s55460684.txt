                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Right-sided
 indentation upon the trachea with fullness of the superior mediastinum may
 reflect a thyroid goiter.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes
 seen within the thoracic spine without acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 2. Probable thyroid goiter accounting for the superior mediastinal widening
 and indentation upon the right aspect of the trachea.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended and further assessment with thyroid ultrasound can be obtained.
