                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dizziness, HTN; ?infectious process  // ?infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Correlation is made to neck CTA
 from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the left midlung is likely due to pleural
 based scarring visualized on CT scans.  Increased interstitial markings in the
 lungs this likely due to patient's known underlying bronchiectasis.  There is
 no new focal consolidation or effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 similar compared to prior. Tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is
 noted. Old healed left posterior rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Changes compatible with scarring and bronchiectasis in the lungs without new
 confluent consolidation.
