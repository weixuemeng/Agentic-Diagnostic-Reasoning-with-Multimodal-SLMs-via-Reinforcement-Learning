                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate pleural effusion. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT Chest report ___ from Atrius. No images were available
 for viewing at the time of interpretation.
 
 FINDINGS: There is no large pleural effusion.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is only seen on the frontal view and may reflect
 atelectasis/scarring.  Multiple pulmonary nodules described on the CT chest
 report from Atrius dated ___ are better evaluated on that study since
 CT is more sensitive.  No pneumothorax or focal air space consolidation.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours and hilar
 structures are unremarkable.  Chronic to sub-acute left-sided rib fractures
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is only seen on the
 frontal view and may reflect atelectasis/scarring, small pleural effusion
 difficult to entirely exclude, but no moderate or large pleural effusion is
 seen.
