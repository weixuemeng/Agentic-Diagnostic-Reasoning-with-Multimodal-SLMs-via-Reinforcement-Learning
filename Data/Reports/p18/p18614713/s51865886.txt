                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with status epilepticus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung
 bases, potentially atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  There may
 be a trace left pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is seen, though
 the left apex is somewhat obscured by an oxygen face mask over this region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible trace left
 pleural effusion.
