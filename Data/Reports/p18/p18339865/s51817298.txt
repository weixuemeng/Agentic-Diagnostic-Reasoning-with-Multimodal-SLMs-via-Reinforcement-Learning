                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with desaturations to 40s.  // Any acute
 cardiopulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ line ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are
 noted in the lung bases, present on the previous examinations, perhaps worse
 when compared to the most recent chest radiograph.  These findings may reflect
 atelectasis and/or recurrent aspiration pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may be perhaps worse when compared to the
 most recent chest radiograph.  These findings may reflect atelectasis and/ or
 recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
