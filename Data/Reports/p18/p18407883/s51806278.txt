                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In the left upper lobe, there is a poorly defined small nodular opacity which
 warrants further evalution.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.No pleural
 abnormality is seen. Osseous structure demonstrate generalized
 demineralization, with some loss of height in the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small nodular opacity in left upper lobe could potentially be due to an early
 focus of pneumonia, but lung cancer is an additional consideration. Short-term
 followup radiograph after antibiotic therapy may be helpful to assess for
 resolution. Alternatively, chest CT could be considered for further
 characterization, particularly the patient has risk factors for lung cancer
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
