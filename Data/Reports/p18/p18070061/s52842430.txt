 Confluent bilateral hilar opacities may represent increasing adenopathy. 
 Right upper lung nodule is partially obscured by metallic fiducials. 
 Fiducials are seen in the right lower lung, projecting over ill-defined
 opacities.  There is mild increase reticular opacities, likely due to low lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left-sided infusion
 port terminates mid SVC.
