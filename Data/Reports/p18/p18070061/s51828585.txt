 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness

 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. Reference made to chest CT
 from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating in the proximal to mid SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax. Right upper lung nodular opacity likely corresponds
 to that seen on chest CT from ___, not seen on chest radiograph
 earlier from ___. Additional pulmonary nodules noted from ___ chest CT are better assessed on the CT. No lobar consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The
