                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Empyema, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pigtail catheter
 has been removed.  There is a small amount of left pleural fluid that remains
 visible.  At the posterior aspects of the right hemithorax, an indistinct zone
 of increased radiodensity is seen, potentially scar tissue or remnant
 subpleural opacity.  Resolution of this zone needs to be documented on
 radiographs.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 appearance of the left lung base.
