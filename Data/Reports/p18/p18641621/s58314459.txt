                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and lung abscess, status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A chest tube appears unchanged in the right hemithorax.  Residual
 bibasilar opacities appear unchanged.  The only discernable change is an
 increased coarsening of lung markings in the right mid-to-upper lung and, to a
 lesser degree, in the left mid lung.  This appearance may be associated with
 superimposed mild fluid overload or alternatively an inflammatory process of
 airways.  Correlation with clinical course is suggested.
