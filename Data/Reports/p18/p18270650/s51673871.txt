                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post central line placement, evaluate for line position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph and semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the upper SVC. The
 endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea 4 cm above the carina. Enteric
 tube projects over the left upper quadrant likely within the gastric body.
 
 There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  Focal opacity at the right upper
 lobe may represent pneumonia/aspiration pneumonitis.  Cardiac silhouette is
 stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple known bilateral
 anterior rib fractures are better appreciated on CT torso.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right IJ terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 2.  Probable right upper lobe pneumonia/aspiration.
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
