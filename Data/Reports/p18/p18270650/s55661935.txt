                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man recently extubated s/p cardiac arrest now with
 some respiratory distress  // Eval for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube was removed. As expected, the lung volumes have slightly
 decreased, causing crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at the
 lung bases. However, in addition, minimal fluid overload is now present. The
 right internal jugular venous introduction sheet is constant. Mild
 cardiomegaly. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
