                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of pulmonary
 TB treated in ___, establishing of the baseline before initiation of
 immunosuppressive therapy.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 No prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Multiple nodular opacities are
 projecting over the upper lungs with areas of scarring and volume loss in the
 right upper lobe and focal nodular, most likely calcified granulomas seen in
 the left upper lobe.  No consolidations to suggest current active tuberculosis
 are demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Sutures are noted along the left neck consistent with known prior
 thyroidectomy.
