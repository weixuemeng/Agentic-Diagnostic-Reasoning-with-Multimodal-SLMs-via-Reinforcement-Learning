                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new right IJ  // Eval for new line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 11:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter which terminates at the cavoatrial junction/ right atrium.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The right costophrenic angle is not fully
 included.  Patchy left basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection or
 aspiration.  Suggestion of ovoid lucency projecting over the lateral left
 hemidiaphragm may be artifactual due the adjacent atelectasis although
 superimposed bowel is not entirely excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
