  No focal consolidation.  Linear left base opacity is most consistent with
  atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with a
  small pleural effusion which appears to extend superiorly along the left chest
  wall.

 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleuritic chest pain on immunosuppression 
 // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low bilaterally. Linear opacity in the left lung base, likely
 represents platelike atelectasis.  There is a small left-sided pleural
 effusion.  There are no focal consolidations or pneumothorax.  The hila,
 mediastinum, and heart are within normal limits. Also noted is chronic
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
