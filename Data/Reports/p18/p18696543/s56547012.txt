                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of treated TB, now with chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs and CTA chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared with the prior examination, there has been no significant interval
 change.  Redemonstrated is scarring within the right upper lobe, compatible
 with the patient's previous granulomatous disease.  The previously identified
 right middle lobe nodule is not well visualized on the current exam.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary
 edema.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Stable right upper lobe scarring, better evaluated on the prior CTA chest.
 
 
 3.  The previously visualized 7 mm right middle lobe nodule is not well
 appreciated on this exam. However, prior CT follow-up recommendations still
 apply since it might not be consistently visible on radiographs.
