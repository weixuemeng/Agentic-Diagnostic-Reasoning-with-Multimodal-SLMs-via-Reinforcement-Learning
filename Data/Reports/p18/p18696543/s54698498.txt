                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachypnea, left pleural effusion  // Eval for
 infiltrate, worsening effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 Patchy left basilar opacity is seen, increased from prior. As well, there is a
 relative linear area of opacity at the more lateral left lung bases may be due
 to increased atelectasis. . The patchy opacities could be due to infection,
 aspiration, or atelectasis. There is subtle blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, similar to prior, suggesting a small left pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar retrocardiac opacity appears increased from the prior
 study and may be due to infection, aspiration, and or atelectasis. More linear
 opacity in the lateral left lung base, increased from prior, may relate to
 atelectasis.
 
 Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggest a small left
 pleural effusion.
