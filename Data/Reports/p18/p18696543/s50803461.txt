                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain and low-grade fever as well as tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for rightward rotation and portable technique.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the right mid lung is a nodular
 focus, perhaps an artifact involving confluence of normal vascular shadows,
 although a lung nodule should be considered and excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Potential nodule projecting over
 the right mid lung.  As a first step in further assessment, when clinically
 appropriate, standard PA and lateral radiographs are suggested to evaluate
 further when feasible versus chest CT.
