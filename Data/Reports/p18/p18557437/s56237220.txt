                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M transferred from an OSH with intracranial bleed, now with
 aspiration  // to look for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the current study common the endotracheal tube appears to be within 2 cm of
 the carina however this may in part be due to positioning.  Lung volumes are
 unchanged.  There is persistent severe cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar consolidation
 again noted.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  Bibasal
 consolidation may reflect pulmonary edema or aspiration/pneumonia.
 
 The endotracheal tube does appear to have migrated distally however this may
 be due to patient positioning.  Recommend continued attention on followup.
