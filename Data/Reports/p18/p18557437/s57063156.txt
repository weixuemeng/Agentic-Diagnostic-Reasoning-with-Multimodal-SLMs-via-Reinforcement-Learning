                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p trach peg  // eval trach      eval trach
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube is
 been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube that appears to be well
 seated without evidence of complication.  Nasogastric tube has been removed.
 Substantially lower lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the
 substantially enlarged heart.  There is poor definition of the hemidiaphragms,
 which could represent small pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
