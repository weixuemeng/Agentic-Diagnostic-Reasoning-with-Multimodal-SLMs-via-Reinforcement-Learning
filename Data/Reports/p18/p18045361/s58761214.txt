                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear metallic density projects over the upper trachea on a
 single image.  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well aerated.  No
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 right mediastinal border is prominent with soft tissue density along the right
 paratracheal stripe.  The remainder of the mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged from ___.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Prominent soft tissue density along the right paratracheal stripe is
 incompletely evaluated and could be due to rotation. Recommend non-emergent CT
 chest for further evaluation.
 3.  Metallic density projecting over the upper trachea may lie external to the
 patient.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
