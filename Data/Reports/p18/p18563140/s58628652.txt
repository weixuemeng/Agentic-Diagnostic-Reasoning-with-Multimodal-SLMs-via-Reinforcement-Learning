                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Current film is obtained supine, compared with a film from ___ at 21:30
 p.m., which was obtained upright.  
 
 Allowing for this, there are diffuse alveolar opacities, possibly with small
 bilateral effusions. The alveolar opacities are diffusely somewhat worse,
 though possibly accentuated by differences in positioning. The most likely
 etiology is CHF with pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting, other alveolar processes could account for this appearance.   The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly unchanged.
 
 The left IJ central line overlies the brachiocephalic vein near the confluence
 with the SVC, unchanged.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath
 diaphragm, off film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse alveolar opacities, worse compared with one day earlier,
 though the current film was obtained supine.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this is compatible with pulmonary edema.
