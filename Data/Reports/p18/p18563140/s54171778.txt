                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, unresponsive.  Check ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Endotracheal tube is
 seen with tip approximately 5.5 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes are
 noted. There are, however, diffuse hazy opacities in the lungs, potentially
 related to diffuse edema.  Clinical correlation regarding possibility of
 diffuse infection is warranted.  There is prominence of the upper mediastinum.
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for positioning and
 technique.Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube 5.5 cm from the carina.  Diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, potentially due to diffuse edema versus bilateral infection. 
 Clinical correlation suggested.
 2. Prominent upper mediastinal contour, potentialy in part due to technique
 and position or prominent mediastinal fat however if clinical concern, CT can
 be performed to further evaluate.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:30 am on ___ via phone.
