                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILMS ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left IJ repositioned, check placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 311.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest films, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The left internal jugular central line has been repositioned so that its tip
 now lies in the proximal SVC.  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and
 right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter are unchanged in position.  The
 diffuse airspace process appears to have somewhat cleared, although there is a
 persistent opacity throughout both lungs and therefore this would favor
 resolving pulmonary edema rather than diffuse pneumonia or ARDS.  Stable
 overall cardiac and mediastinal contours.  No pneumothorax.  Probable small
 bilateral layering effusions.
