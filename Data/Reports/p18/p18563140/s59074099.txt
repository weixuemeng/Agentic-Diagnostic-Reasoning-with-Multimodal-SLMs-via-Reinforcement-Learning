 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post PEA arrest, intubated status post
 rewarming, check ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is provided.  ET tube is
 approximately 3 cm from the carina.  NG tube courses below the diaphragm.  The
 left internal jugular catheter is now in the left brachiocephalic vein.  A
 right triple-lumen catheter has been removed.  Again seen are bilateral
 diffuse opacities similar in appearance to the prior study which may be due to
 pulmonary edema.  There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and slightly enlarged.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 3 cm above the carina.
 2.  Left internal jugular catheter now in the brachiocephalic vein.
 3.  Bilateral opacities are likely pulmonary edema.
