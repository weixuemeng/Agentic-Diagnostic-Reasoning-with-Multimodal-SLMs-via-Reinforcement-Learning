 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:18 PM
  Right internal jugular catheter tip projects at level of low superior vena
  cava. No pneumothorax evident on this view. No other change. Low lung volumes
  with bilateral pulmonary opacities, cardiomegaly, and stable endotracheal tube
  position. Esophageal catheter tip is out of view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 18:41
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old dialysis catheter placed and right IJ.  Check
 position.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 17:39.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 18:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of a right internal jugular central line with placement
 of a large-bore hemodialysis catheter which has its tip in the mid-to-lower
 superior vena cava.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at thoracic inlet,
 unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  Lung volumes remain low with patchy bilateral opacities which
 could reflect pulmonary edema, bilateral pneumonia, or ARDS.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity for detecting
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
