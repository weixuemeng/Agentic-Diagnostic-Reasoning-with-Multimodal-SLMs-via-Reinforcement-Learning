                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Two subtle
 adjacent areas of patchy opacity projecting over the left upper lung could be
 sites of infection.  Additionally, projecting over the posterior lower lung
 bases posteriorly, there is subtle opacity which could be due to atelectasis
 or consolidation, no definite correlate on the frontal view.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two subtle areas of opacity projecting over the left upper lung
 may be sites of infection, correlate to see if there is any external artifact
 that could be in that area.  Additional subtle focal opacity projecting over
 the posterior lung bases on the lateral view without a clear correlate on the
 frontal view, may be due to atelectasis; however, consolidation or infection
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The above findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 5:50 p.m.
