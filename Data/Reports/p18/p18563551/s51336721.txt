                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:33
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, intubated, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 2:07.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:33 is submitted.  Both of the
 costophrenic angles are not entirely included on the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.8 cm above the carina, unchanged.  A left
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and likely coiled within
 the stomach, although the entire tube is not visualized on this study.
 
 2.  There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar patchy
 opacity which likely reflects atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  Right paratracheal soft tissue may represent
 lymphadenopathy or be related to a fluid replete state.  Clinical correlation
 is advised and this area can be further evaluated on followup imaging. 
 Interval improvement in pulmonary edema since the previous study.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Deformity of the right second anterior rib likely is
 related to prior trauma.
