                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  On the lateral view, however,
 there is suggestion of some increased opacification in the retrocardiac region
 that does not definitely silhouette the hemidiaphragm.  This is not clearly
 appreciated on the frontal view.  Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, the possibility of a developing consolidation in this region would
 have to be considered.
 
 No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
