 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough.
 
 AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Bilateral prominence of pulmonary arteries is most
 likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension, although some degree of
 lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  Coronary and aortic valve calcifications
 are noted.
 
 Patient is in interstitial pulmonary edema associated with bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Re-evaluation of the patient is
 recommended to assess the hila for the presence of lymphadenopathy versus
 enlarged pulmonary arteries.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the phone at 2:50 p.m. on
