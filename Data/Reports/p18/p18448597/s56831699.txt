                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube.  Evaluate placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carinal.  A nasogastric tube ends in
 the stomach.  The lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are slightly widened which may be due to technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.
