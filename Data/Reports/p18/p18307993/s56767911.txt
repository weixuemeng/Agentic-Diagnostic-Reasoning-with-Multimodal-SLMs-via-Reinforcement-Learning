                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic breast cancer, hypotensive now
 w/increased O2 requirement after IVF  // ? extent of pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior films, inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.  There
 is probable vascular plethora, slightly more than on the prior film, though
 this is presumably accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation as well as increased patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region.  Possible small left effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes, slightly worse compared with 611.
 2. Increase in the appearance of vascular plethora, suggestive of CHF, though
 the appearance is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and patchy opacity at the
 right base likely also reflect atelectasis accentuated by low lung volumes,
 but the possibility of an infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude
 in this setting.
