                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with DVT on apixaban who presents s/p mechanical
 fall  // ? Fracture, bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of osseous injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of trauma. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion
 is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
