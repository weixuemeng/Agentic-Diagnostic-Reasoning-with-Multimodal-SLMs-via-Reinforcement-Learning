                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 4:03.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PICC line, tracheostomy tube, left basilar chest tube remain in
 place.  There is a stable left apicolateral pneumothorax.  There is persistent
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle with associated lower lobe air space
 disease which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  The right lung demonstrates patchy opacity at the medial base
 which also likely reflects patchy atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  Cardiac
 mediastinal contours are likely stable.  No pulmonary edema.
