 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:07 AM
  Pt with known left apical bullous and prior left basilar hydropneumothorax. Pt
  also with history of prior left apical pleurodesis.  S/p chest tube removal
  today with acute brief desaturation that has now resolved. Question recurrence
  of PTX.  Findings: left basilar pleural effusion is stable.  No sign of
  basilar pleural air.  In left lung apex, a new linear contour is visualized
  without clear correlate on multiple recent prior examinations.  Though this
  could reflect a pleural line, an apical PTX is less likely given the hx.
  Alternatively, this may be due to a septation of the known bullous simply
  imaged at a different angle.  Possibilities were discussed with ICU resident
  ___ at 1:03 am on ___ by telephone. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST AT 11:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Previous pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:37 p.m.:
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is distinguishable from large pneumatoceles,
 but I cannot tell if it has developed since 5:37 p.m.  Small left pleural
 effusion is stable.  Aside from mild right basal atelectasis that lung is
 clear.  Heart size normal.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Left PIC
 line ends low in the SVC.
