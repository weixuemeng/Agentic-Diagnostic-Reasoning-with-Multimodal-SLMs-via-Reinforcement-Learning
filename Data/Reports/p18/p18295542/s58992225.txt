                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:14 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  COPD and tracheobronchomalacia with tracheostomy, now with worsening
 dyspnea.  Assess pneumonia, pulmonary edema and pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is the same or slightly larger.  New
 heterogeneity in the opacification in both lung bases, particularly the right
 raises serious concern for widespread pneumonia.  Nodular opacities in the
 suprahilar regions of both lungs could be vessels on end, or there may be new
 small lung nodules.  Small left pleural effusion and moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone at 8:25 a.m. with doctor caring for this
 patient in the NICU.
