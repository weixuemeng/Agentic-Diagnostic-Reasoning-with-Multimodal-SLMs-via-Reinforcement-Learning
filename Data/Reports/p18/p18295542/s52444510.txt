                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Large opacity in the left upper lung is
 concerning for pneumonia; however, possibility of mass lesion cannot be ruled
 out.  Left-sided pleural effusion is minimal.  Heart size, mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  Minimal opacity at the right lung base is likely
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Large left upper lung consolidation is likely pneumonia; however, a
 possibility of lung mass cannot be ruled out.  If prior chest radiographs are
 made available, a comparison can be made and addendum can be added to the
 report accordingly.  
 
 2. Small left pleural effusion and mild right lower lung atelectasis.
