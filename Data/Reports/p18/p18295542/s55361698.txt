                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Jammed chest tube, assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:17 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an approximately 1
 cm left apical pneumothorax.  It is possible that the pneumothorax was not
 fully appreciated because it was hidden on the previous image by an ECG
 electrode.
 
 Unchanged monitoring and support devices, including the known left chest tube.
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged appearance of the right
 lung.
