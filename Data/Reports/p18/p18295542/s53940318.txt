                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Stable scarring and fibrosis is seen in
 the left upper lobe.  Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, more prominent on
 the left, consistent with the known bronchiectasis and scarring.
 
 No evidence of acute focal consolidation, though this could be hidden in the
 patient's other chronic changes and must be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
