                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // ? tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine frontal image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left central line terminates in the proximal right atrium.  The ET tube
 terminates approximately 8.5 cm above the carina and could be advanced 4 cm
 for more optimal position.  A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC.  A
 feeding tube terminates in the stomach.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Alveolar opacities are seen diffusely through the
 bilateral lungs, along with cardiomegaly, consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema. Bilateral pleural effusions likely present.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with probable bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  ET tube terminates approximately 8.5 cm above the carina and could be
 advanced 4 cm for more optimal position.
