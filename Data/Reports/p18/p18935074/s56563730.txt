                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCV, ESRD, HIV presents with productive
 cough and fever  // Eval PNA      Eval PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.  The
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive pulmonary abnormality has developed and/or progressed since ___.
 8 consists of consolidation in the lingula, and nodules and small irregular
 opacities distributed throughout the remainder of both lungs.  This is
 presumably largely multifocal infection, perhaps with more than one pathogen,
 including Pneumocystis, but con current malignancy should be considered, for
 example Kaposi sarcoma.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Hilar enlargement, particular on the right could be due to both
 vascular and nodal enlargement, and lateral view suggests subcarinal
 mediastinal adenopathy.
 
 Indwelling right jugular central venous infusion port ends in the upper SVC as
 before, and indwelling large 4 left trans jugular catheter ends close to the
 superior cavoatrial junction, partially withdrawn from its previous location. 
 No pneumothorax.  Minimal left pleural effusion.
