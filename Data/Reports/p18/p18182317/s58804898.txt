 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes remain low but are improved
 as compared to the previous examination.  On neither the frontal nor the
 lateral radiograph, there is convincing evidence of substantial pleural
 effusions.  Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with subsequent
 basal areas of atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  The alignment of the sternal wires is normal.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or other complications.  Paralleling the lower border of the second
 left rib, there is unchanged evidence of a minimal curvilinear structure that
 might represent a minimal remnant left apical pneumothorax.
