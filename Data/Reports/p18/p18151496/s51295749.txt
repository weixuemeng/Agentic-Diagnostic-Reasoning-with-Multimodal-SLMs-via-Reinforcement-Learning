                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, fever and aches.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  The
 lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of
 underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There are interstitial
 changes within the lung bases, with no new focal opacity demonstrated. 
 Additionally there is a suggestion of punctate high density material within
 the right lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic interstitial abnormality within the lung bases which could reflect
 chronic aspiration given the presence of punctate radiopaque material in the
 right lung base possibly representing aspirated barium.  Findings could be
 better characterized with a dedicated chest CT on a nonemergent basis.
