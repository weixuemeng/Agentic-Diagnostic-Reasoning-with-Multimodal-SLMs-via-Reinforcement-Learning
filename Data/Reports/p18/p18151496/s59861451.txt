  Improvement in the appearance of the pulmonary edema when compared to prior. 
  Persistent bibasilar opacities are likely chronic.  Some residual right apical
  opacity could represent continued resolving edema although superimposed
  infection is also possible.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, question volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There has been interval improvement
 in the appearance of the pulmonary edema seen on prior.  There is residual
 bibasilar interstitial opacity which may be chronic in nature given its
 appearance on ___.  Additional right apical opacity persists since
 most recent and could represent resolving edema although infection is not
 excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Left chest wall dual lead
 pacing device is again seen.  Vascular stent projects over the right
 subclavian region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement in the appearance of the pulmonary edema when compared to prior. 
 Persistent bibasilar opacities are likely chronic.  Some residual right apical
 opacity could represent continued resolving edema although superimposed
 infection is also possible.
