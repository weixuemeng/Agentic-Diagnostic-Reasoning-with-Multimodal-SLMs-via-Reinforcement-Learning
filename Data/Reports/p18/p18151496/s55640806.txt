                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___ 
 
 FINDINGS: The left pectoral pacemaker is again seen unchanged in position. 
 Pacemaker leads are seen terminating adjacent to the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is no evidence of lead fracture.  A right subclavian vein
 stent is unchanged in position.  Finally, sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips are unchanged.  
 
 The heart is enlarged but unchanged in size from the prior study.  The aorta
 is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Compared to prior, there are new diffuse
 alveolar opacities and septal thickening, suggestive of new mild pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis or possibly
 chronic aspiration.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar opacities, which may represent
 atelectasis or chronic aspiration.
