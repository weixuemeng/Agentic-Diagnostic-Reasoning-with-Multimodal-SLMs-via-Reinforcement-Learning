                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of end-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis, now presenting with acute dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Pacemaker generator and leads appear in
 unchanged position.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  A mesh metallic
 stent projects over the right lung apex.  As compared to most recent prior
 examination, there are new diffuse alveolar opacities and septal thickening
 with probable new moderate bilateral pleural effusions and increasing
 cardiomegaly, findings consistent with new moderate pulmonary edema.  Basilar
 opacities may reflect atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 New moderate pulmonary edema with probable bilateral pleural effusions and
 atelectasis
