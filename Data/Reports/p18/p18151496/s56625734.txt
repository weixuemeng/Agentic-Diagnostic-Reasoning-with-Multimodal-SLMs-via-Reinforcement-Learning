                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male on dialysis with bacteremia.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:   A right-sided tunneled hemodialysis
 catheter terminates at the right atrium.  There is a left-sided pacemaker
 generator projecting leads into the right atrium and ventricle.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The aorta is moderately calcified
 and tortuous.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The diaphragms
 are flattened, reflecting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Increased
 bibasilar linear and hazy opacity may reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 interstitial edema. Slightly increased density at the right base may reflect
 an early consolidation.  There is moderate atelectasis of the right middle
 lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: Appearance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with
 atelectasis and edema at the bases.  Possible early consolidation at the right
 base.
