 INDICATION:  Patient with history of stroke and aspiration.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate slightly hyperexpanded
 lungs.  Pulmonary edema seen on ___ exam has resolved.  Minimal
 bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The descending aorta appears
 tortuous.  Aortic arch calcifications are present.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  There is mild blunting of the costophrenic angle, suggestive of
 trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacities are not seen on
 appreciated on the lateral view.  The bones are diffusely demineralized. 
 Extensive degenerative joint changes of thoracic and bilateral shoulder joints
 are noted.
  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to ___ exam, there is interval resolution of pulmonary
 edema.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
