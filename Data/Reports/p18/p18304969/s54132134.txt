                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally worrisome for moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities are
 seen which could be due to infection and/or aspiration.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen although trace effusions would be difficult to exclude.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities, could pulmonary edema however,
 may also relate to underlying infection and/or aspiration.  Enlarged cardiac
 silhouette.
