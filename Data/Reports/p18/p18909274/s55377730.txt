                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  HIV and concern for tuberculosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Attenuation of
 upper lung markings and a large suspected bulla in the right upper lung
 suggest emphysema.  There is again widespread scarring in the lower lungs
 bilaterally with a very similar pattern.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearance of the chest.  Sequela of tuberculosis is not excluded
 regarding lung opacities. The pattern suggests stable scarring probably
 related to emphysema and prior infections.
