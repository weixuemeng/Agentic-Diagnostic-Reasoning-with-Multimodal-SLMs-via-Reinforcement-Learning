                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with severe dementia and unable to hold still. 
 With low-grade fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 Study is very limited due to patient's positioning and likely element of
 scoliosis. There is increased density projecting over the right lung as well
 as there is volume loss and calcification of the pleura on the right side.  It
 is difficult to exclude pneumothorax based on these images and if there is
 high clinical concern for pathology, would recommend a chest CT.  The left
 lung appears well aerated.  Heart size is upper limits of normal.  Overall,
 allowing for differences in technique and patient's positioning, there is no
 appreciable change since the ___ study.
