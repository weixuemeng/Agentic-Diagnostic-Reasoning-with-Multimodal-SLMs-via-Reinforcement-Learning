                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall and pelvic fracture. Pre-operative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal chest radiograph is markedly rotated to the right side. 
 Thoracic scoliosis also limits the study.  Extensive pleural calcifications
 throughout the right hemithorax are of unknown chronicity.  Additionally, a
 pleural effusion is likely present on the right, but the size is difficult to
 determine due to positioning.  The left lung is clear and there is no
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is not well evaluated due to patient positioning. 
 Superior subluxation of the right glenohumeral joint is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Extensive right pleural calcifications of unclear etiology.  If prior
 imaging is available, a direct comparison can be made.  
 
 2. Probable small right pleural effusion.
