                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Retrocardiac
 air-fluid level is likely due to a hiatal hernia, with adjacent atelectasis. 
 No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hiatal hernia.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
