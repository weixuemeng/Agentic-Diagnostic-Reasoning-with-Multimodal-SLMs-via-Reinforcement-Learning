 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous examination, the miniscule left pneumothorax has
 completely resolved.  The pre-existing right pneumothorax is smaller but still
 clearly visualized.  There is no evidence of tension.  Improved transparent
 see of the lung parenchyma reflect improved ventilation.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette has decreased.  Increased density at the lateral aspect of
 the seventh right rib is unchanged.
