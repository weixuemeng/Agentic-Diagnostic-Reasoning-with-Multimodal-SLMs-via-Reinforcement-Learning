                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with leukocytosis  // PNA?      PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 22:07 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with interval increase in
 size of the right effusion.  Associated bibasilar opacities, left greater than
 right.  Findings more likely reflect compressive atelectasis given the overall
 lack of change, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is some fluid
 loculated within the horizontal fissure.  A single lead left-sided pacer is
 unchanged in position with the lead terminating over the expected location of
 the right ventricle.  A right internal jugular large bore catheter is
 unchanged in position.  Stable deformity of the right humeral head with anchor
 sutures.
