                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening cough  // eval effusion vs pna    
 eval effusion vs pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are well expanded and clear.  Heart is normal size.  Pulmonary and
 mediastinal vasculature are normal.
 
 An abnormal mediastinal contour, a left lateral convexity obliterating the
 aortopulmonic window has been present for many years.  Presumably this is
 mediastinal fat deposition or an indolent thymic lesion.  I doubt it is
 connected to the current problem of cough.
 
 Transvenous pacer lead is unchanged in position, looped in the right atrium
 and terminating in the right ventricle, continuous from the left pectoral
 generator.  .
