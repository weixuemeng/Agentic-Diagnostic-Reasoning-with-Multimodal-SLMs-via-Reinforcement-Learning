                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with progressive shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature, limiting evaluation of
 early changes related to vascular congestion.  There is no overt interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  There are no focal opacities concerning for pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of overt interstitial pulmonary edema but low lung
 volumes limit assessment of cardiovascular status.  If continued clinical
 concern for fluid overload, repeat radiographs can be performed after with
 improved lung volumes.
