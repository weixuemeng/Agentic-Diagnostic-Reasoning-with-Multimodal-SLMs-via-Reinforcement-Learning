                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a ___-year-old man with chest pain and
 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, resulting
 in exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette.  Allowing for this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely within normal limits.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  On lateral view,
 there are apparent diffuse increased opacities likely related to extremely low
 lung volumes.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes.
