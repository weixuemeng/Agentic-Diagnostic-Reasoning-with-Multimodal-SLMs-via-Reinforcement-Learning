 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  A streaky right lower lung opacification suggest
 minor atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Calcified chondroid matrix is partly visualized in
 the proximal right humerus consistent with an enchondroma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  No evidence of free air.
 
 3.  Enchondroma in the proximal right humerus.
