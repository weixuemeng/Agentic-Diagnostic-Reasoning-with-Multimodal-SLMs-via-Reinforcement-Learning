                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of motor vehicle collision after
 shootout and right pneumothorax, status post right chest tube removal.  Study
 requested for assessment of pneumothorax resolvement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and abdominal/pelvic CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval improvement of a residual tiny right apical pneumothorax.  There
 is a cluster of cavitary lesions in the right lower lobe. In the setting of
 recent trauma and given the presence of a larger contusion in this area
 previously, these findings are consistent with pulmonary laceration injury. 
 Left lower lobe opacity remains unchanged and likely represents a pleural
 effusion.  There is right juxtahilar linear atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. 
 Subcutaneous air within the right chest wall is improving.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improving residual tiny right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Right lung base cavitary lesions consistent with pulmonary laceration
 injury.
