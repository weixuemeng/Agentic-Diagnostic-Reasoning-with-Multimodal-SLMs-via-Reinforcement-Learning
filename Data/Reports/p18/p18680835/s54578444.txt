                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina, and a
 recently placed nasogastric tube terminates in the region of the
 gastroduodenal junction.  Right chest tube continues to have a low lying
 termination, with tip located adjacent to the right twelfth rib, as discussed
 by telephone with Dr. ___ at 7:40 a.m. at the time of discovery on ___.  Very small right apical pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Rapidly improving multifocal pulmonary opacity in the
 right upper and both lower lobes likely represent multifocal contusion with or
 without co-existing aspiration.  Rounded lucency within the dominant right
 lower lobe area of consolidation could potentially represent co-existing
 pulmonary laceration.  Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the
 right chest wall.  Lucency in right upper quadrant of the abdomen may
 potentially represent free intraperitoneal air in this patient who is status
 post recent abdominal surgery.
