                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after removal of the chest
 tube.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is minimal questionable right
 apical pneumothorax, and there is subcutaneous air within the right chest wall
 as well as left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion.  Within the
 right lower lung, most likely at the mid portion, there is a pre-existing
 lucency, similar to the prior examination, on the left more pronounced as
 compared to the right.  Cavitation is of concern and examination with chest CT
 is required.
