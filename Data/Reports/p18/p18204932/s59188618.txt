                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with trauma, evaluate for injuries, pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  Linear opacities near the left lung base are probably
 platelike atelectasis.  More diffuse airspace in the right lower lung medially
 obscuring the right heart border may represent atelectasis, developing
 infection or sequelae of aspiration, or possibly small pulmonary contusions in
 the setting of recent trauma.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lung consolidation, either pneumonia, aspiration, or possibly
 pulmonary contusions from recent trauma.
 2. Left lower lung platelike atelectasis.
 3. No evidence of displaced rib fracture.  Note, chest x-ray is not sensitive
 for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib fractures.
