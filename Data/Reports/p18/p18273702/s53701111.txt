                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is technically limited by low lung volumes and inability to
 raise the left arm for the lateral view.
 
 A 2.6 cm diameter, well-defined rounded opacity is present in the right upper
 lobe overlying the intersection of the right first anterior and right fourth
 posterior ribs, just above the right hilum.  The lungs are otherwise
 remarkable for patchy and linear opacities at the left base suggestive of
 atelectasis or scarring.  Heart size is normal, and mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits allowing for accentuation by low lung
 volumes.  There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  2.6 cm diameter right upper lobe nodule, for which chest CT is
 recommended for further characterization as communicated by telephone to Dr.
 ___ at 10:10 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
