                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with an outside hospital chest CT scan from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Subtle PE with fever and chills, myalgia, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment of the lungs is more thoroughly performed on the outside
 hospital CT, though there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax
 seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.
