                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with worsening hypertension,
 rhonchorous lungs making it difficult to assess for _____.  ? developing
 volume overload/CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  There is marked progression of the left-sided
 pulmonary abnormalities now resulting in practically total whiteout of the
 left hemithorax.  Degree of mediastinal shift towards the right, which existed
 already before has further increased.  There is no evidence of new parenchymal
 abnormalities in the right hemithorax beyond those described earlier and
 interpreted as most likely representing some pulmonary congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression to complete opacification of the left hemithorax
 _____ previously diagnosed Aspergillus pneumonia.  Some degree of pulmonary
 congestion is present in the right hemithorax, but has not increased
 significantly in comparison with previous study.  The now demonstrated new
 densities in the left hemithorax cannot be explained by fluid overload alone.
