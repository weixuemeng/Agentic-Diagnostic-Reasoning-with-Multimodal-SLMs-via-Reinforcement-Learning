 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:04 PM
   Improved aeration of left apex suggestive of decrease in left upper lobe
  colaapse.  Large consolidation persists in the left mid lung zone with
  probable collaspe or effusion in the left lower lung zone.  Probable small
  right effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia in setting of transfusion, also
 with necrotizing pneumonia, question flash pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison made to patient's prior study of ___ at 8:22.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.
 2.  Interval improvement in aeration in the left upper lung with persistent
 more consolidative mass-like area in the left mid lung and suggestion of a
 layering effusion. These findings are consistent with the known necrotizing
 pneumonia.   There is also likely a right pleural effusion.  However, the
 areas of ill-defined opacity in the right lung have somewhat improved, which
 likely reflects resolving superimposed interstitial edema.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to patient rotation and a
 diffuse left hemithorax process.  No pneumothorax.
