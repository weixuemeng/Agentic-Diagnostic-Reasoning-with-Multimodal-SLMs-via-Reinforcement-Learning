 pneumonia.  Moderate right pleural effusion and right lower lobe consolidation
 has not improved.  There may have been mild interstitial edema in the right
 lung, over the past several days.  If so, this has improved.  Cardiac
 silhouette is substantially obscured and cannot be evaluated.  No
 pneumothorax.  Left PIC line ends low in the SVC.
