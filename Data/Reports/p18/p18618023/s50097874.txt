                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with neutropenic fever and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ and ___, abdominal CT
 of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are lower with basilar bronchovascular crowding.  This could
 also explain the mild cardiac enlargement and venous vein widening; however,
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema could also be possible.  Small pleural
 effusion is new if any.  There is no focal pneumonia.  The patient is known
 with prior exposure to asbestos and bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
 
 Right-sided PIC line ends in upper right atrium, advanced since the previous
 exam where it was in lower SVC.  It could be pulled back 2.5 cm.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pneumonia.
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar bronchovascular crowding.
 3.  Possible mild pulmonary edema with cardiac enlargement and widening of the
 azygous vein.
 4.  Right-sided PIC line is in mid atrium and could be pulled back around 2.5
 cm.
 
 Dr. ___ has been contacted for the results.
