 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  MDS, fevers, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase
 in number and extent as well as in size of the pre-existing pulmonary
 opacities.  In addition, the vascular structures have increased in diameter so
 that a combination of infectious process with fluid overload is likely.  This
 is supported by an increase in size of the cardiac silhouette and by newly
 appeared small pleural effusions, best appreciated on the lateral radiograph.
