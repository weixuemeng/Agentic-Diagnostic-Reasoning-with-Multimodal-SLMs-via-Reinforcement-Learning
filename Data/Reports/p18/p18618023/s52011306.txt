                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, fungal pneumonia, evaluation of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is lesser inspiration
 and, as a consequence, lower lung volumes than on the previous image.  The
 extent of the pre-existing right parenchymal opacities are constant.  The left
 lung apex has increased in transparency, potentially reflecting improved
 ventilation and reduced pleural effusion.  The large left perihilar mass is
 unchanged.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position and course of
 the left PICC line.
