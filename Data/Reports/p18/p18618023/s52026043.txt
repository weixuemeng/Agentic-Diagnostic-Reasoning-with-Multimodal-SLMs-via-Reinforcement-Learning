                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as one
 dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of MDS, presents with
 leukocytosis, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are stable
 nodular opacities projecting over the right and left lungs which are
 indeterminate, though appear stable from multiple prior studies and could
 represent calcified granulomas.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or
 CHF.  A fat-containing Bochdalek hernia accounts for the contour abnormality
 of the hemidiaphragm posteriorly.  There are somewhat coarsened interstitial
 markings, which could represent underlying scarring or emphysema.  No definite
 signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Tracheobronchial tree calcification noted.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Multiple small nodular opacities
 in the lungs, which appear stable compared with multiple prior exams and these
 could represent calcified granulomas.
