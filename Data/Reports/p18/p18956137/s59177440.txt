                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Report from chest radiograph ___.  Images are not
 available for direct comparison at this time.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Retrocardiac streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine with anterior osteophyte
 formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No evidence of mediastinal widening.
