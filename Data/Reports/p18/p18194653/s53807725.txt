                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Massive PE, right TandemHeart, worsening oxygenation, edema.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at ___, there is new patchy opacity in both lungs,
 scattered throughout the lung on the right and centered about the left hilum
 on the left.  The ET tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 3.4 cm
 above the carina.  Tubes over the right heart from both superior and inferior
 approach are unchanged.  Tubes coiled over the superior mediastinum noted.  No
 pneumothorax detected.  No effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Developing bibasilar patchy opacities, ? edema or other alveolar process,
 such as ARDS, infection, or possibly hemorrhage. Clinical correlation
 requested.
 
 2) Tubing coiled over superior mediastinum.  
 
 Findings discussed with the covering house officer, Dr. ___, at the
 time of discovery at approximately 12:55 p.m. on the day of the exam (___,
 phone). Based on that, the tubing coiled in the upper mediastinum is thought
 to represent a temperature probe, rather than an NG tube.
