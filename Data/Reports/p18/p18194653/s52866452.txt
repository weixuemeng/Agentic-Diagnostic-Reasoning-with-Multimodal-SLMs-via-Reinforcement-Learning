                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Massive PE on ECMO.  Interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung apices are not included on this study.  A large diameter right-sided
 central catheter terminates in the right atrium.  A left-sided central
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  An NG tube has its side port terminating
 in stomach however the tip travels inferiorly terminating out of few.  
 
 Low lung volumes are unchanged.  There is bilateral mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The small left pleural
 effusion is improved.  The right hemidiaphragm is obscured suggesting layering
 pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pulmonary infarct.  There are no new focal
 opacities.  Incompletely visualized coiled tubular structure in the upper
 esophagus is redemonstrated, and was previously described to be a temperature
 probe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
 
 2. Small left pleural effusion is improved.  
 
 3. Right lower lung opacity may represent pleural effusion, atelectasis, or
 pulmonary infarct.
