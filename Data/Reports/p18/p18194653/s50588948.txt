                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Marked interval improved aeration in the right lower lobe compared
 to the prior study, but continued diffuse airspace opacification throughout
 the majority of the left lung with relative sparing of the left lung base. 
 These findings may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema with or without
 co-existing infection.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance
 with persistent right-sided cardiac enlargement.
