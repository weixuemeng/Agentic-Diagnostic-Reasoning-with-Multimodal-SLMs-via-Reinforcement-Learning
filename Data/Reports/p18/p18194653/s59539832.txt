 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary embolism.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph from ___.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4 cm above the carina,
 appropriately sited.  There is a coiled tubular device projecting over the
 left superior mediastinum which is unchanged.  Previously seen large caliber
 catheter projecting over the right heart and into the main pulmonary outflow
 tract has been pulled back several centimeters with the distal lead tip in the
 proximal right atrium.  Please correlate clinically.  The patchy opacities
 throughout both lung fields described previously have improved somewhat, now
 less apparent.  There remains a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The
 endotracheal tip and side port are within the stomach.
