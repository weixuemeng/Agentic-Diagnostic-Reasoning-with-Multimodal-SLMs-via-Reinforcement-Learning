                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
