                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Atypical chest pain and fatigue.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal including prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No definitive abnormality is seen.  Prominence of the pulmonary artery is
 noted that might potentially reflect pulmonary hypertension and correlation
 with echocardiography is suggested.
