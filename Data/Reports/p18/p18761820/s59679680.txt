                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with intubated transfer.  Evaluate endotracheal and
 orogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina.  The orogastric tube ends
 off of the radiographs.  There are bibasilar linear opacities.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified.  The heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Linear bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 2. Appropriately positioned endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
