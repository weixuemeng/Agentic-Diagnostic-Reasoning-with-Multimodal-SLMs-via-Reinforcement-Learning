                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with CP  // CP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased opacity at the right lung base with a configuration of the
 diaphragm with peak relatively lateral compatible with subpulmonic effusion. 
 Linear right midlung opacity is similar to prior, potentially combination of
 fluid in the fissure and atelectasis.  Left basilar atelectasis is noted. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips project over
 the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  Right midlung opacity as on recent
 prior, potentially fluid within a fissure or atelectasis.
