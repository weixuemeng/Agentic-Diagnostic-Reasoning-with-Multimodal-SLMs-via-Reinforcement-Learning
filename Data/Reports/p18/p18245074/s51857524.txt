                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough, invasive klebsiella
 bacteremia, evaluate for infiltrate.  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___. Targeted review of chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous. No CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion is identified. There
 is minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles. There is minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis at the left lung base and possible minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis at the right base. A pigtail type drain projects over the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen, similar to the prior radiograph.
 
 The peripheral pulmonary nodule in the lower portion of the right upper lobe,
 immediately above the minor fissure, is again seen, and is in keeping with
 findings on the ___ CT scan. This nodule was described is stable
 compared with a outside reference CT from ___, but long-term
 stability remains to be established.
 
 Mild anterior wedging of the T11 and T12 bodies is unchanged compared with a
 ___ CT scan. Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the visualized portion of the spine.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no frank consolidation identified.
 2. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles could reflect trace pleural
 effusions.
 3. 7- 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper zone peripherally,  near the
 minor fissure. If this patient is at low risk for lung cancer, then a followup
 CT in ___ months would be recommended. If this patient is at high-risk for
 lung cancer, then followup CT in ___ months would be recommended. (___
 criteria).
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 20:09 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
