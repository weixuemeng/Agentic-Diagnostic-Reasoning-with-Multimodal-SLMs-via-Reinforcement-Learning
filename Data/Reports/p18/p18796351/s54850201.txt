                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent MI and pulmonary edema, now resolving.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  When compared to prior study the ET tube has been removed.  The NG
 tube has also been removed.  There is improvement in the amount of bibasilar
 changes and  bilateral pleural effusions with left retrocardiac atelectasis
 persists.  There is modeling deformity of some right ribs suggestive of
 fractures.  There is improvement in the overall amount of pulmonary edema
 present.  A left-sided Swan catheter appears in unchanged position with the
 proximal right pulmonary artery.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Interval improvement in amount of pulmonary edema.  Swan-Ganz catheter in good
 position.  Ongoing bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
