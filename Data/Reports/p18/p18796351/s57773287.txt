                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset atrial fibrillation and epigastric discomfort, here to
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is vague increased density projecting over the medial right apex, which
 is indeterminant but a nodule is possible at this site.  Otherwise the lungs
 appear clear including unchanged but striking bilateral apical pleural
 thickening.   The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Deformities involving several
 right lateral ribs are unchanged and compatible with remote prior fractures.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Vague density at the medial right apex, potentially a lung nodule. 
 Evaluation with chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate. 
 
 Preliminary interpretation placed to ED dashboard at 3:30 pm while the patient
 was still in the ER.
