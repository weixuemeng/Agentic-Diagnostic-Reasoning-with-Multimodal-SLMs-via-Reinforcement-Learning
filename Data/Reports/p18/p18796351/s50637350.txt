                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from approximately one hour earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubation, check ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  There has been
 interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing
 approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is seen coursing inferiorly
 along the midline with its tip excluded from view.  There is diffuse pulmonary
 edema redemonstrated with bilateral pleural effusions likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube positioned appropriately.  NG tube appears also
 to be positioned appropriately, though the tip is excluded from view.  Diffuse
 pulmonary edema with pleural effusions again seen.
