                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, and chest CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Rightward
 deviation of the upper trachea is secondary to a known left sided thyroid
 nodule.  Ill-defined right middle lobe opacity correlating to a known
 spiculated nodule with adjacent scarring is similar to the prior radiograph
 and is better depicted on the prior CT. No new areas of focal consolidation,
 mass lesion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax are present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right middle lobe ill-defined opacity compatible with known carcinoid
 pulmonary metastasis.  No new areas of focal consolidation or mass lesions
 identified.
 2.  Rightward deviation of the upper trachea due to known left sided thyroid
 nodule.
