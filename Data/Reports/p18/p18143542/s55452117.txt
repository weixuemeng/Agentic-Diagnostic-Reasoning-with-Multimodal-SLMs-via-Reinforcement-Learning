                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post paraesophageal repair, in ED with
 dilated stomach  // evaluate placement of NGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and outside hospital CT abdomen
 pelvis ___ at 06:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube tip and side port are within a massively distended stomach. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Bulging of the distal
 mediastinal contours likely reflects the paraesophageal complex collection, as
 seen on the previous CT.  Coronary artery stents are re- demonstrated. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob are again noted.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases
 without focal consolidation.  Trace left pleural effusion is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Radiopaque foci in the upper abdomen likely reflect retained
 barium within colonic diverticula.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Nasogastric tube in standard position within the stomach, however the
 stomach remains massively distended.
 2. Small left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Bulging of the distal mediastinal contour compatible with apparent
 paraesophageal complex fluid collection, as seen on CT.
