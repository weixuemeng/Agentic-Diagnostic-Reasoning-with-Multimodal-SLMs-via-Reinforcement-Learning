                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent PICC placement.  Evaluate
 positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new right PICC tip projects in the proximal right atrium, 7.8 cm below the
 carina.  It should be withdrawn approximately 2-2.5 cm for optimal placement. 
 Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter tip are unchanged in position.
 
 The large layering left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and right
 lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged from the prior study.  There is probably
 a small right pleural effusion.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  No new
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The new right PICC tip projects in the proximal right atrium, and should
 be withdrawn approximately 2-2.5 cm for optimal placement.
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Unchanged large layering left pleural
 effusion with atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
