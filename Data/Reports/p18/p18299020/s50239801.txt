 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal PNA and complicated
 parapneumonic effusion s/p chest tube placement  // ?change in complicated
 parapneumonic effusion; ?hest tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is again seen a left-sided pigtail catheter in unchanged position. 
 There are no pneumothoraces.  There is slight decrease in the left-sided
 pleural effusion.  There has been worsening of the perihilar opacities
 particularly about the right side.  Although this may be related to pulmonary
 edema, the vascular pedicle is not widened, therefore, infectious etiologies
 should also be considered.
