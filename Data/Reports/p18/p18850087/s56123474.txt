                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new left sided chest tube  // r/o PTX     
 r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 00:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ 23:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a left basilar pigtail chest tube with improving
 aeration in the left mid to lower lung and near complete resolution of the
 pleural effusion.  There are residual patchy opacities within the left mid and
 lower lung as well as at the right base favoring resolving atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated on this semi upright study.  Heart remains stably
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stably widened, although this may be
 related to portable technique and positioning.  This can be better evaluated
 on followup imaging.  No pulmonary edema.
