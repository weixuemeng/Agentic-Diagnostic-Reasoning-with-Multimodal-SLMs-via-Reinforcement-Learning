 INDICATION:  Patient with right-sided rib fractures, evaluation for developing
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___ through ___.  Chest CT ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pneumothorax. Increase in minimal pleural thickening, effusion or
 hemothorax is due to multiple right-sided rib fractures from the lateral fifth
 through ninht ribs.  The left lung is unremarkable.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are mildly enlarged but stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild increased in pleural thickening, pleural effusion or hemothorax is
 reactive to multiple right-sided rib fractures.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 2.  By reviewing the CT ___ ___, a left lower lobe round consolidation
 measuring 2 cm was described.  As said earlier, a chest CT could be done to
 re-assess this abnormality if not already done.
