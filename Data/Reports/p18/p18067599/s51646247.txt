                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today as well as a chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, possible aspiration, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is no clear sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Known pulmonary
 nodules seen on prior CT are too small to visualize on radiograph. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures appear intact
 with AC joint arthropathy noted bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative for acute abnormality.  Please note, known lung
 nodules as seen on prior CT compatible with metastatic disease, cannot be
 clearly visualized on radiograph.
