                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // pna?      pna?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  There is again diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications,
 more prominent on the left and slightly less prominent than on the prior
 study.  The appearance is consistent with bilateral layering effusions and
 volume loss, probably with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia.
