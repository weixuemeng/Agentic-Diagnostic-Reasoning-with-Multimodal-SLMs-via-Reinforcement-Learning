                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dysphagia and hypernatremia to 166 and
 hypoxic respiratory distress  // evaluate for pulmonary edema, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Improved bibasilar airspace opacities are most likely due to improving
 aspiration.  Prominence of the ascending thoracic aorta is stable. There are
 no new consolidations or pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Resolving bibasilar opacities, possibly representing clinically suspect
 aspiration.  Continued radiographic followup recommended to ensure resolution
 and to exclude infectious pneumonia at the right lung base.
