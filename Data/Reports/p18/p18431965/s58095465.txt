 COMPARISON:  ___ and prior chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Overlying EKG leads are present.
 Lungs are hyperinflated. There is a vague residual opacity spurs projecting
 over the right and left lung base. While this may represent atelectasis/
 partially layering effusion, the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude. Otherwise the lungs appear well aerated. No evidence of edema,
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are
 intact. Residual barium is noted within bowel in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal opacity projecting over the lung bases, question effusion/atelectasis.
 Cannot exclude pneumonia.
