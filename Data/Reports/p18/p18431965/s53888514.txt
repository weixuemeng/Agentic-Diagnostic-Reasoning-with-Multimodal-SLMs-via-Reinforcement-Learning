                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately half an hour prior, as well
 as ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the
 endotracheal tube, which now terminates in the mid thoracic trachea. A
 nasogastric tube again courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge
 of the image. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, with patchy opacity at
 the right base which could represent a combination of pneumonia and vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which now terminates in the
 mid thoracic trachea.
