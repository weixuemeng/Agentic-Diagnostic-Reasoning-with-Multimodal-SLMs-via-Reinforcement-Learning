 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 3 hours prior, as well as ___, ___, and ___.

 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 an endotracheal tube, which terminates at the carina. A nasogastric tube
 courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image.  The
 remainder of the exam is similar, with patchy opacity at the right base is
 concerning for pneumonia.

 Interval intubation, with the endotracheal tube terminating at the carinal.
 The tube can be pulled back approximately 3 cm to terminate in the mid
 thoracic trachea.
