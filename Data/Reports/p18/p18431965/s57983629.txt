 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:25 AM
  The NG tube has been removed. Since the prior exam, the bilateral pleural
  effusions have increased in size, particularly on the left. Otherwise there is
  no change, including no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 12:59 AM

 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 8:24 AM
  The NG tube has been removed. Since the prior exam, the bilateral pleural
  effusions have increased in size, particularly on the left. Otherwise there is
  no change, including no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
  
  FINDINGS:  At the base of the right hemithorax have been present since
  ___.  It may be necessary to obtain lateral radiographs or even Chest
  CT 2 distinguish between these possibilities.
  Heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is generally large and somewhat
  calcified but not clearly focally aneurysmal.
  Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is
  no pneumothorax.  Large and small bowel in the upper abdomen are distended but
  not fully evaluated by this study.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p removed NGT, s/p EGD today, new onset
 tachypnea and desats  // ?acute process      ?acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 8:30 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New U density opacification at the base of the left lung could be explained by
 moderate left pleural effusion and/or left lower lobe atelectasis. Similar
 abnormalities at the base of the right hemithorax have been present since
 ___.  It may be necessary to obtain lateral radiographs or even Chest
 CT in order to distinguish between these possibilities.
 
 Heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is generally large and heavily calcified
 but not clearly focally aneurysmal.
  There is no pneumothorax.  Large and small bowel in the upper abdomen are
 distended but not fully evaluated by this study.  There is no evidence of
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC.
