                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with femur fracture and new hypoxia  // r/o
 PNA, source of hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 The patient has a large hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia containing
 stomach, colon, and peritoneal fat.  This likely accounts for the opacity seen
 in the right mid and lower zones.  The right paratracheal opacity is likely
 accounted for by a large right thyroid nodule.
 
 Allowing for these opacities on the right, no definite superimposed infiltrate
 is identified.  Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 No focal infiltrate or effusion detected in the left lung.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 There is cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and very mild
 vascular plethora which could either relate to COPD for represent early CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Possible early CHF.
 
 No obvious infiltrate.  However, much of the right lung is obscured by the
 patient's extremely large hernia as well as the large right thyroid nodule.
 
 Note is made that the CT obtained on ___ at 01:17 did not show a
 pulmonary infiltrate, only mild right sided atelectasis.
