                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided pleural effusion, status
 post uncomplicated thoracocentesis with 750 cc of serous fluid removed. 
 Evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  During the examination interval,
 successful and uncomplicated left-sided thoracocentesis was performed.  The
 lung fields have cleared up and the left diaphragmatic contour is now visible.
 The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any blunting pleural effusion. 
 Volume of left hemithorax still remains reduced in comparison to the more
 normal appearing right-sided hemithorax.  This most likely is related to the
 earlier described paramediastinal mass in the left hilar area.  Previously
 described permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position with dual
 intracavitary electrode system is unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed on
 either side.
