                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Long smoking history with recurrent small cell carcinoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again, there is a left hilar mass with volume loss and opacification
 in the left upper lobe, consistent with a post-obstructive pneumonia or
 collapse.  The right lung is essentially clear.
