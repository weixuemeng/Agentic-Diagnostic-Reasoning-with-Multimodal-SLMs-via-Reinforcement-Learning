                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest burning, to rule out worsening
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  In comparison to the prior study, there has
 been no significant interval change in the left hilar mass with volume loss
 and opacification in left upper lobe, which likely represents postobstructive
 pneumonia/collapse.  The right lung is clear.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since the prior study in the
 extensive left upper lobe consolidation and  hilar mass.  No large pleural
 effusions.
