                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited as the left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the field-of-view.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle is unchanged.  Again noted is a left upper lobe paramediastinal
 mass.  Opacification in the left lung base likely reflects a combination of a
 moderate-to-large pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior exam.  No evidence
 of congestive heart failure.  Persistent left pleural effusion and left
 basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis.  Left upper lobe
 paramediastinal mass compatible with known malignancy.
