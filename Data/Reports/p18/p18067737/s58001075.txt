                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and CTA chest on ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is clear.  There is new diffuse patchy opacities
 throughout the left upper lobe and lingula.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 slightly elevated.  There is a more dense opacity compared to the prior study
 and is concerning for either a mass or more confluent consolidation.  Prior
 radiation changes are also seen within the left lung.  There is a small
 pleural effusion on the left.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours on the
 left are blurred by superimposed lung opacification.  The right mediastinal
 and hilar and cardiac contours are normal.  Pacemaker is in place with
 biventricular leads in the appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe opacification with mild volume loss concerning
 for pneumonic consolidation and possibly post-obstructive pneumonitis
 associated with a new central mass, radiation stricture, or mucus plug.  More
 central denser opacity may represent mass or particularly dense area of
 consolidation.  CT is recommended to better assess if needed clinically,
 preferably with intravenous contrast if no contraindications exist.   
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:30 p.m. on ___ by telephone.
