                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with tia/stroke symptoms  // eval for cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to portable technique, relatively low lung volumes
 and patient body habitus. That said, there increased interstitial markings
 throughout the lungs bilaterally, similar compared to prior. This could be due
 to pulmonary edema or chronic interstitial process and is not significantly
 changed from prior. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may be due
 to atelectasis or effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly
 changed especially in light of rotation to the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings despite limitations of technique which could
 represent edema although chronic underlying interstitial process or
 combination both is possible.
