                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is again a
 perihilar opacification, and a mild interstitial abnormality is present, worse
 in the right lung than left, but diffuse.  Vascularity is also indistinct,
 suggestive of mild vascular congestion on this examination, similar to
 improved, but apparent differences may be largely due to technique.  A focal
 right lower lung opacity, apparently in the right lower lobe, persists,
 worrisome for pneumonia without definite change.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present along the lower
 thoracic spine.  In addition, there is an irregular appearance along the
 course of the right anterolateral fifth and possibly sixth ribs, suggestive of
 possible remote prior rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Focal right lower lung opacity, possibly pneumonia (atelectasis could also
 be considered).  Correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended and
 consideration of followup imaging is suggested if clinically indicated.
