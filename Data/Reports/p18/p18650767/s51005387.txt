                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is mild unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  There is perihilar fullness bilaterally with
 indistinct central pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary vascular
 congestion or fluid overload.  In addition, within the right lower lung, there
 is a potential focal developing opacity, so coinciding pneumonia could be
 considered.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate vascular congestion with a
 potential developing focal opacity in the right lower lung, possibly pneumonia
 in the right lower lobe in the appropriate clinical setting (although
 atelectasis could also be considered).
