 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Diabetes mellitus, hypoxia and night sweats, concern for
 pulmonary changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are high.  There is minimal loss of lung
 structure, in particular at the lung apices, left more than right.  At the
 bases of the left lung, a minimal area of atelectasis and scarring is seen. 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable and shows no evidence of acute
 or chronic changes, notably no evidence of pneumonia, TB, or pulmonary edema. 
 There are no pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.
