 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:23 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in position.  There are slightly
 worsening bilateral layering pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities likely
 reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Slight interval improvement in mild interstitial edema.  Due to
 marked patient rotation, assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is
 not possible on this study.  No pneumothorax.
