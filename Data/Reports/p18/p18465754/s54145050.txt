                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and cough, shortness of breath; evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior study.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  As seen on
 prior examination, there is a suggestion of increased density in the right
 lower lung without a lateral correlate and this likely represents a summation
 effect from overlying soft tissues.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
