                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea on exertion in a patient with a history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the prior
 study.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened
 consistent with the provided history of COPD.  A suggestion of increased
 opacity in the right lung base on the frontal view could not be not confirmed
 on the lateral view.  There is no pulmonary edema, vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Unchanged cardiac and mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible increased opacity in the right lung base could not be confirmed on
 the lateral view, however, in the correct clinical setting could represent
 pneumonia.
