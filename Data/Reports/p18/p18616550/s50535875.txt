                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube
 position.
 
 Comparison to prior study, ___ at 7:25.
 
 Portable supine chest film, ___ at 13:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax which would be
 concerning for an increase in pleural fluid or hemorrhage within the pleural
 space with associated near complete collpase of the left lung.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip projecting over the stomach.  The left subclavian central line
 terminates in the distal SVC, unchanged.  Interval intubation with the
 endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The
 right lung remains inflated and is grossly clear.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy for a CABG with assessment of cardiac and mediastinal
 contours limited due to the near-complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax.  The patient is also rotated markedly to the left, limiting
 evaluation.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Results were communicated
 directly to the patient's nurse, ___ by phone on ___ at 2:10 p.m. who
 informed us that the patient is currently undergoing bronchoscopy for lung
 collapse, possibly related to mucus plugging.  Followup chest film will be
 ordered shortly.
