                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, rule out pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged.  The patient is strongly
 rotated to the left, which makes an assessment and a direct comparison
 difficult.  There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions.  A U-shaped
 hyperlucent line reflects part of a postoperative pneumopericardium.  The
 right lung is unremarkable.  A linear lucency is caused by a skinfold.
