                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with opacification of the left hemithorax
 status post bronch, evaluate for change.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted and compared to the
 prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, feeding tube and left subclavian central line remain
 unchanged.  There continues to be near-complete opacification of the left
 hemithorax with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in the upper
 region.  These findings would be concerning for a re-accumulated pleural fluid
 or hemorrhage into the pleural space.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Right
 lung remains grossly clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There has been a prior
 median sternotomy, although the cardiac and mediastinal contours are not able
 to be assessed due to the left hemithorax opacification and patient rotation
 on the current study.  Np pneumothorax.
