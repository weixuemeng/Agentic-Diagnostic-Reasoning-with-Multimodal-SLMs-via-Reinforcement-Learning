                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent bronchoscopy.  Evaluate for aeration in
 the left lung.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 improvement in the aeration of the left upper lung, with persistent
 opacification of the left lower lung, likely representing a combination of
 pleural effusion and atalectasis.  There is a small right-sided pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Endotracheal tube ends 2.3 cm from the carina.  The left-sided
 subclavian central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in aeration of the left upper lung with
 persistent left sided pleural effusion and adjacent atalectasis.
