  Interval improvement of near-complete opacification of the left lung, with
  increased aeration of the left upper lobe.  Retrocardiac opacity and left lung
  opacity still remain, which could reflect persistent pleural fluid and or
  hemorrhage within associated lung collapse.  The right lung is clear.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lung collapse, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved expansion
 of the left lung.  However, a relatively large area of predominantly basal
 lung parenchyma is still collapsed.  The appearance of the monitoring and
 support devices and of the normal right lung are constant and unchanged.
