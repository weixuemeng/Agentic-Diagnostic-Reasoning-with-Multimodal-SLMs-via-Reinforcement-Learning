                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of ventricular tachycardia; now intubated.  Assess line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 5.5
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip
 out of the field-of-view.  Fluffy central perihilar infiltrates are most
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema, slightly more prominent on the right
 than left.  There is no focal airspace consolidation.  There is no definite
 pleural effuion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours appear slightly
 widened, possibly due to position.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of lines and tubes.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Nediastinal contours appear slightly widened, possibly
 due to position.
