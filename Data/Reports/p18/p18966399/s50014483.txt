                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable, allowing differences in lung volumes. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and edema has nearly resolved with
 minimal residual interstitial edema remaining.  Prominent lucency in left
 upper quadrant of abdomen may be due to effects of rotation, but attention to
 this region on short-term followup radiograph is suggested to exclude the
 possibility of basilar pneumothorax or atypical manifestation of free
 intraperitoneal air.
