                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with ventricular tachycardia status post
 extubation.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight improvement in
 pulmonary edema following extubation, which may indicate increased cardiac
 function.  If present, pleural effusions are small in size.  Mediastinal
 contour is wide, but unchanged, and this is likely due in part to distention
 of mediastinal vessels.  The right internal jugular central venous line is
 seen with the tip ending at the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight improvement in pulmonary edema following extubation may indicate
 improved cardiac function.
