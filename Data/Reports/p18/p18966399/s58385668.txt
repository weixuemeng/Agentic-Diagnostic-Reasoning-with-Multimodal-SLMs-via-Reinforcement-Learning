                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New right internal jugular central venous catheter.  Evaluate
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 13:45.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, a new right central venous catheter has been
 placed.  The tip is in the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory
 position, 4.8 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm
 with the tip out of the field of view.  Again, there is mild pulmonary edema. 
 There is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged, and remain prominent..  The heart size is
 unchanged and mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of the new right internal jugular central
 venous catheter.  No pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no change.  Mediastinal
 contours remain prominent, which may relate to patient positioning and body
 habitus, but if concern for an acute mediastinal process, consider CT, which
 would provide more detail.
