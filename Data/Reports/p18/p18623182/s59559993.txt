                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and new PICC
 line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 04:33 hours.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and Dobbhoff tube are unchanged and in standard
 positions.  A new left upper extremity PICC tip projects 8.5 cm below the
 level of the carina, and should be withdrawn 3 cm for more optimal positioning
 at the cavoatrial junction.  Airspace opacities bilaterally, right greater
 than left and favoring the upper lobes, likely represent a combination of
 aspiration and atelectasis and are improving from yesterday's CTA except for
 focal worsening in left lower lobe. Mild perihilar pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours remain
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left upper extremity PICC placement, terminating in the right atrium;
 the tip could be withdrawn 3 cm for more optimal positioning.
 2.  Improving bilateral opacities likely reflecting a combination of
 aspiration pneumonitis and atelectasis.
 
 Findings with respect to the PICC placement were discussed with ___, ___
 nurse, at 3:30 p.m. by phone.
