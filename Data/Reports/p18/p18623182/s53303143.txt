                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for worsening pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is a
 mild increase in the right basilar opacification.  Although this could merely
 reflect atelectasis, supervening aspiration or pneumonia must be seriously
 considered.
 
 Remainder of the study is unchanged.
