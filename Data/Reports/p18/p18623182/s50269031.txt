 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous examination, the course and position of
 the Dobbhoff catheter are not substantially changed.  The pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities appear comparable in distribution and severity.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is also stable.  The lungs show no evidence of
 pneumothorax or other complications.
