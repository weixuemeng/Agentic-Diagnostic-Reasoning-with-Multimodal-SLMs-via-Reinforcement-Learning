 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory decompensation, acute vascular problems.
 
 FINDINGS:  The examination is compared to ___, 2:37.
 
 As compared to this radiograph, the patient has been extubated.  The other
 monitoring and support devices are in constant position.  The bilateral
 relatively widespread parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination
 of fluid overload and pneumonia, have not substantially changed, with
 exception of the retrocardiac lung areas were the opacities are minimally
 improved.  No pneumothorax.  No other pathologic changes.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette.
