                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with vertigo and left
 vertebral artery dissection.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.  The NG tube has been
 removed.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Slight
 interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Right
 lower lobe consolidation is currently more conspicuous than on the prior study
 and might be concerning for infectious process or aspiration pneumonia.  Left
 basal atelectasis is redemonstrated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
