                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Additional history gathered from the patient and his wife includes a
 remote prior right-sided pulmonary resection and the changes detailed in the
 report may reflect chronic changes from that procedure.

  Focal opacity at the lateral aspect of the right lung. Associated right
  lateral fourth rib appears focally eroded and could be related therefore chest
  CT is suggested to further assess for underlying mass. Otherwise, no acute
  cardiopulmonary process
