 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 There has been interval placement of a left pectoral pacemaker with dual leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The course of the leads
 is unremarkable and there is no pneumothorax.  The inspiratory lung volumes
 are appropriate. The hazy left basilar opacity corresponds to a large fat
 containing diaphragmatic hernia. There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.

 No pneumothorax.  Unchanged left basilar opacification due to large
 fat-containing diaphragmatic hernia.
