                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and recent upper respiratory tract infection.  Room air
 saturation at 92%.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are slightly low.  There
 are patchy opacities in the lung bases, similar to the prior study likely
 reflecting areas of atelectasis.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
