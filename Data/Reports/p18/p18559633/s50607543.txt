                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with massive anasarca up to his mid-abdomen with
 wheezing on exam with a brief desat episode.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lung
 volumes are low which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the
 lung bases, as seen on the previous radiograph, and not substantially changed.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.  Mild degenerative changes are noted to the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued bibasilar patchy opacities.  This may reflect atelectasis but
 pneumonia is not excluded.  No pulmonary edema.
