 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  There is asymmetric opacification more prominent at the left
 base. Although this could merely reflect atelectatic changes, this appearance
 raises the possibility of left lower lung pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting. Atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
 Right subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
