                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PEA arrest s/p CPR due to hypoxemia.  //
 Interval change, pulmonary HTN
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 8.9 cm above the carina on this
 lordotic film. Pacemaker type leads overlie the chest.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent, but likely accentuated by technique and unchanged. Hazy density at
 the left lung base is consistent with a small to moderate left effusion, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal patchy opacity again noted
 in the right cardiophrenic region. There is vascular plethora, though this is
 likely also accentuated by technique and appears slightly improved compared
 with the earlier study. No right effusion identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar
 prior study. CHF findings appear slightly improved.
