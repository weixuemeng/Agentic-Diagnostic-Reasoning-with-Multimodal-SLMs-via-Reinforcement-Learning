                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are extremely low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 pulmonary vasculature.  Within this context, heart size is likely normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 Bibasilar opacities are present, likely representing atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely representing
 atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider repeat examination with better inspiration and
 lateral view, if possible.
