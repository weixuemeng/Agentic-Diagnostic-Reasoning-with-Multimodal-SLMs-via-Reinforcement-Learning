                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chronic cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Two calcified nodular opacities
 project in the left lower hemithorax medially in the frontal view, difficult
 to localize in the lateral view.  There are probably calcified granulomas in
 the left hilum.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax, or
 pleural effusion.  Mild degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Calcified lung nodules.  Compare to prior studies if available. 
 If no prior studies are available for comparison, evaluation with CT is
 recommended.
