                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with R-CVL placement  // evaluate R-subclavian
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 03:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 hr earlier, there has been
 interval placement of a right subclavian line which terminates just below the
 expected level of the cavoatrial junction.  Enteric tube terminates in the
 body of the stomach.
 
 Right lung base opacity is similar.  Slight interval improvement and left lung
 base opacity, suggesting atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right subclavian line terminates just below the expected level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
