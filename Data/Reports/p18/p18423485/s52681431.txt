                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dementia here after fall  // ?fx ?bleed
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited by patient positioning. Heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle has improved, now small, consistent with residual
 pleural effusion or thickening.  Thoracic spine degenerative changes appear
 stable.  Mild irregularity along a right mid thoracic lateral rib is
 nonspecific and may represent a fracture of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild irregularity of a right mid thoracic lateral rib may represent a rib
 fracture of indeterminate age. Dedicated rib films could be obtained for
 further evaluation if warranted clinically.
 
 2.  Interval improvement of now small left costophrenic angle blunting, either
 residual pleural effusion or thickening.
