                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after motor vehicle crash, evaluate for rib fractures.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 There is a focal patchy opacity in the right upper lobe.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
 There is slight blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle but the
 posterior costophrenic angles are clear.  There is no pneumothorax. Note is
 made of tortuosity of the desending thoracic aorta.
 
 No rib fracture is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No rib fracture seen.  However if there is continued clinical suspicion, a
 dedicated rib series with localized area of pain may be obtained for further
 evaluation. 
 
 2.  Small focal patchy opacity in the right upper lobe.  If previous studies
 elsewhere do not become available for comparison, a dedicated non-emergent
 chest CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude underlying mass.
