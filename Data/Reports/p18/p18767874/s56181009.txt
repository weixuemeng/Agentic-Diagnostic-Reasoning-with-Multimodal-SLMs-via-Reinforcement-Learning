                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Uremia and pericardial effusion with possible lung consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Central catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
 
 There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, especially
 considering that this is a PA rather than AP view.  Opacification in the
 retrocardiac area most likely represents volume loss in the lower lobe and
 effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, a supervening
 pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.  No evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
