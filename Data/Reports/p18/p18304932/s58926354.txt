                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute shortness of breath and chest
 pressure.
 
 STUDY:  AP portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to prior exam, there is now marked elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with right basilar atelectasis.  Additionally, there is shift of
 the heart and mediastinum towards the left, also with retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculatures is present.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle raises the question of a small pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Right hemidiaphragmatic elevation with associated atelectasis, but no
 pneumothorax - findings raise the question of right phrenic nerve abnormality,
 volume loss, or mass effect from abdominal ascites.
