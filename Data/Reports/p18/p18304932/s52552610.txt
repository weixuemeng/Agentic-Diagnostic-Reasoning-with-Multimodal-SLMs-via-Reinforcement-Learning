 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Given slightly low lung volumes, the lungs appear clear aside from minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 Cardiac size is within normal limits.  No large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The right upper hemi thorax is not
 completely evaluated due to the overlying external line.  A small triangular
 opacity appears to be overlying this line projecting above the fifth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. A small triangular opacity appears to projecting above the fifth rib,
 probably external to the patient but consider repeat PA lateral to assure no
 lesion in this area without the wire in place.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:
 Results posted to the ED dashboard including recommendation for additional
 imaging.
