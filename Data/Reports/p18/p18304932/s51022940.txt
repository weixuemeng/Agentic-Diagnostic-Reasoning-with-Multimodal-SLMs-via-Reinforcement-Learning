                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shakiness and shortness of breath, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate slightly
 decreased inspiratory lung volumes with lower lobe opacification likely
 related to bronchovascular crowding, greater on the right than the left.  No
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette appears increased in size compared to the prior radiograph
 of ___, which may be related in part to low inspiratory lung volumes.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clear lungs.  Apparent increased heart size from ___ be
 due in part to low lung volumes.
