 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Acute hypoxemic respiratory distress, now intubated.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 about 5 cm above the carina.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable.  A very small pleural effusion is possible on the right.  The
 left costophrenic sulcus appears sharp.  There is no pneumothorax.  Aeration
 of the upper lungs has improved after intubation, but there is still a mild
 interstitial abnormality including bronchovascular thickening.  The appearance
 suggests improvement in pulmonary edema.
