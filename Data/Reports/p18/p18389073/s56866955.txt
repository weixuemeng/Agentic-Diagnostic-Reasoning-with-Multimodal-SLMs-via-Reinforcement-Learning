                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Heart size is
 within normal limits and stable.  There is a C-shaped calcification projecting
 over the left heart likely reflecting mitral annular calcifications.  Mild
 hilar fullness is noted with subtle interstitial thickening which could
 reflect minimal pulmonary interstitial edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is a mild compression deformity involving a mid
 thoracic vertebral body, stable from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mitral annular calcification, possible mild interstitial edema.
