                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___; a CT chest also
 available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, single AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Although asymmetric,
 widespread bilateral opacification includes interstitial and hazy opacities
 suggestive of pulmonary edema.  Opacity at the medial right lung base
 obscuring the right diaphragm is not completely specific but suggests
 atelectasis and was to some extent present before.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  A moderate lower thoracic compression fracture is probably
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread opacity suggesting pulmonary edema.  Right infrahilar
 opacity, probably unchanged and accordingly likely due to atelectasis. 
 Short-term follow-up radiographs are suggested to reassess, however.
