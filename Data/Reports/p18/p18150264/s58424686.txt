                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with BL leg swelling and need for dialysis  // PNA?
 Fluid overload?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in right base opacity representing increased
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not
 excluded.  There is now a small left pleural effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is
 not accurately assessed due to the large right base opacity, but likely
 remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in large right pleural effusion, underlying consolidation
 not excluded.
 
 New/ increased small left pleural effusion.
 
 Cardiac silhouette size difficult to accurately assess due to the right base
 opacity, but likely remains enlarged.
