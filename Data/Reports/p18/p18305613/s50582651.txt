                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of latent TB,
 now persistent cough and chest pressure, currently reassessment with nipple
 markers.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated, unchanged.  Lungs are
 substantially hyperinflated, most likely with present upper lung emphysema but
 no focal consolidation demonstrated.  No pulmonary nodule is seen.  Nipple
 markers correspond to the abnormality demonstrated on the prior chest
 radiograph.  Apical scarring is noted bilaterally.  Lateral view as well as PA
 view demonstrates the presence of dextroscoliosis, mild-to-moderate.
