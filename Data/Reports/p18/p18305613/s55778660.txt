                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, which can be seen in chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Subtle rounded opacity projecting over the
 right lung base may relate to a nipple shadow which should be confirmed with
 repeat with nipple markers.  Otherwise, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.    The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes are seen
 at the acromioclavicular joints and right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Subtle rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base measuring
 approximately 2.2 cm may relate to nipple shadow which should be confirmed
 with repeat frontal chest radiograph with nipple markers.  No evidence of
 focal consolidation elsewhere.
 
 2. Relatively hyperinflated lungs can be seen with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.
