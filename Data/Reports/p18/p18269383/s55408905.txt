                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post spinal surgery with cough
 and chest pain, evaluate for cardiopulmonary process such as effusion and
 consolidation?
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  The patient has recently
 undergone spinal surgery.  The single view chest examination demonstrates the
 presence of two ___ ___ rods reaching from the lower cervical area down
 to the lumbar spine and outside the lower image field.  There are multiple
 bilateral penetrating fixation screws penetrating into the dorsal pedicles of
 the vertebral bodies.  The overall alignment appears unremarkable.  The degree
 of scoliosis is mild.  There is evidence of pleural effusion in the right base
 obliterating the diaphragmatic contour and the fluid reaching into the minor
 fissure between middle and upper lobe.  The hazy density indicates pleural
 effusions layering posteriorly in the recumbent position patient, but evidence
 of acute infiltrates is not present.  The patient is slightly rotated towards
 the left, which explains the cardiac contours on the left side reaching more
 to the left chest wall in comparison to the previous examination.  It is
 unlikely that the heart is significantly enlarged and there is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear densities on the left base are
 consistent with minor postoperative atelectasis, but again acute infiltrates
 are not present and there is no sign of pneumothorax in the apical area. If
 quantification of the pleural effusion is important effort to obtain lateral
 view may be helpful.
