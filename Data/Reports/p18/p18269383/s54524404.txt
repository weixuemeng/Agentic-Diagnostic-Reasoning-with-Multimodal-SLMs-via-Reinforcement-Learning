                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural
 effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The current study demonstrates substantial interval decrease up to almost
 complete resolution of right pleural effusion.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in
 appearance, including mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.  Note is made that
 the patient's head is obscuring the lung apices.  Extensive hardware in the
 spine is redemonstrated, with no definitive abnormality.
