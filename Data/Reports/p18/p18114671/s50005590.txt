                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever and cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  Prominence of the hilar
 bilaterally is stable.  Dense opacity in the right mid lung and
 pleuroparenchymal scarring in the right apex is unchanged.  There is a new
 nodular opacity projecting over the anterior first right rib, could be
 superimposition of normal structures.  Followup with shallow obliques is
 recommended to exclude a lung nodule.  There is no evidence of pneumonia,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
