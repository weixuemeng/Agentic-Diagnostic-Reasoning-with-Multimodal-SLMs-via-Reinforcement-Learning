                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent cough, wheeze and
 lower lobe crackles, Aspergillus on sputum specimen.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examinations of
 ___ and followup of ___.
 
 The heart size, which can be considered borderline, is unchanged.  The
 thoracic aorta shows mild degree of elongation, but is otherwise unremarkable.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free.
 
 No new parenchymal abnormalities are seen.  Thus, in comparison with the next
 preceding two studies, no significant interval change can be identified.  It
 has to be pointed out that right apical linear scar formations in the
 parenchyma were identified and commented upon multiple previous chest
 examinations.  This is probably a scar formation and joins a local small
 apical thickening of the pleura.  The plain PA and lateral chest examination
 cannot detect any significant interval change.  Considering patient's history
 of immunosuppression and IgG subclass deficiency and the now reported
 Aspergillus in sputum, consider the performance of a high definition CT to
 evaluate in greater detail the otherwise stable scar formations in the right
 apical area.
