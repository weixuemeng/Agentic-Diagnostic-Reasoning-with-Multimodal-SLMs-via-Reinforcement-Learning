                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question apical scarring are overlapping shadows on prior chest
 x-ray.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Apical lordotic view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from 12:17 today.
 
 FINDINGS:  No abnormal right apical opacity is seen.  Questionable finding on
 the prior study was likely due to overlap of structures.  The lungs are
 unchanged and demonstrate evidence of chronic lung disease.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Again, the pulmonary nodules seen on the
 prior CT from ___ are too small to be appreciated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No apical abnormalities.  Questionable finding on the prior study
 may have been due to overlap of structures.
