                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion
 of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Coarse interstitial markings are again seen.  However,
 there is no evidence of acute focal consolidation.  No vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
