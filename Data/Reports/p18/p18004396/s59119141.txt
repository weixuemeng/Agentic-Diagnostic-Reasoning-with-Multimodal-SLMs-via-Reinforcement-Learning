                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with COPD, post-op day 2 for sacral decubitus ulcer
 debridement.  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 10:01
 p.m.
 
 There has been placement of the endotracheal tube.  The patient is rotated
 which limits evaluation; however, the tip appears to be 3 cm above the carina.
 There is a left-sided central line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally.  There
 is unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is an enteric tube whose side port is at the
 GE junction and this could be advanced 10 cm for more optimal placement.
