 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:08 AM
  
  
  
  Left central venous catheter remains in the right atrium but has been slightly
  withdrawn. There are worsening opacities especially in the right upper lobe
  and to a lesser extent the left upper lobe. The lung bases are relatively
  spared. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Again the trachea appears
  rightward deviated although the patient is relatively well centered. This
  cannot be completely accounted for by the aortic arch and as previously
  suggested a mediastinal hematoma may be present. The aforementioned opacities
  most likely reflect pneumonia however hemorrhage cannot be completely
  excluded. There is a background of mild pulmonary edema. Short interval
  followup radiographs are recommended with low threshold for CT of the chest as
  clinically indicated.
  
   The findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by ___ at 18:30,
  ___, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman new line placement  // ? medastinal hematoma
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___:43.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The extent of rightward displacement of the trachea bypossible mediastinal
 hematoma has not changed, and the question of hematoma associated with line
 placement is unresolved. Line has been partially withdrawn to the upper right
 atrium.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Major development over
 the past 13 hr is new severe consolidation in much of the right upper lobe and
 less extensive consolidation in the suprahilar left lung. Heart size is normal
 though slightly increasing in the antrum.
 
 This severe sudden consolidation is atypical bacterial pneumonia, though not
 impossible. Pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered. Occasionally asymmetric
 pulmonary edema in the setting of mitral regurgitation can have this
 distribution.
