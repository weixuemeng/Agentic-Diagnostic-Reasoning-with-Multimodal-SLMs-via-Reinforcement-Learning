 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  with COPD.  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from three hours
 earlier.  There is some worsening of the airspace opacities, particularly at
 the lung bases.  However, there is some mild improvement in the upper lung
 field.  The endotracheal tube and right IJ central line are unchanged in
 position.  Again, the patient appears slightly rotated on the film.
