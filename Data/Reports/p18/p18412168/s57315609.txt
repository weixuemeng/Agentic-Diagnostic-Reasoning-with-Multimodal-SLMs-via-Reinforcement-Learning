                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypoxia  //
 eval for colitis, diverticulitis, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is large area of opacity projecting over the right mid and lower hemi
 thorax worrisome for pneumonia with possible underlying pleural effusion.  The
 left lung is clear.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The right heart border is not well assessed to the right-sided
 opacity, however, the cardiac silhouette appears top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  Relative lucency projecting over portion of the right lung opacity
 felt to most likely represent aerated lung, less likely cavity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
