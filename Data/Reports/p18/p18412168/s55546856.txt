                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ttp over T4 T-spine pain  // eval for fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Increased prominence of the soft
 tissue along the lower right peritracheal region and right hilar region is
 nonspecific, but could be due to lymphadenopathy versus prominent vascular
 structures or mediastinal fat.  Right mid lung atelectasis/scarring is seen. 
 There is no definite focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  Degenerative changes seen along the thoracic spine without
 loss of vertebral body height.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively low lung volumes.  Increased prominence of the right lower
 paratracheal and hilar soft tissue could be due to lymphadenopathy versus
 prominent vasculature or mediastinal/ hilar fat.  This can be further assessed
 on nonurgent chest CT.
