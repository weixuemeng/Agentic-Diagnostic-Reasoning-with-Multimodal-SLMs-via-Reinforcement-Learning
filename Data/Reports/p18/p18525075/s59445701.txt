                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.  Of note is that the prior report was
 dictated for a wrong patient.  The current report should substitute the prior
 report.
 
 The current study demonstrates Port-A-Cath catheter with its tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The lung volumes are low.  There is questionable left
 basal opacity that might potentially represent atelectasis, but in the setup
 of fever, left lower lobe pneumonia is a possibility.   
 No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Pulmonary nodules seen in the apices on the CT torso from ___ are
 not well seen on the current chest radiograph.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___, approximately at
 2:30 p.m.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with chest pain, fever and
 tachycardia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The right PICC line has been inserted with its tip terminating at the level of
 proximal right atrium and should be pulled back approximately 2.5 cm.  The
 rest of the findings are unchanged.
