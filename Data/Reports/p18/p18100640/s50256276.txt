                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough with blood-tinged sputum, but no
 fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Given the patient's history of
 persistent blood tingled sputum, assessment with chest CT is recommended to
 exclude the possibility of radiographically occult abnormality. 
 Calcifications of the aortic arch are noted.
