                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain low with suggestion of volume loss in both lower lobes
 most consistent with atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests the presence of a small
 effusion or pleural thickening.  Scattered calcified nodules in both lungs are
 unchanged since ___ and are therefore consistent with calcified granulomas. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcification of the
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
