                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increasing fatigue and failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Significantly lower lower lung volumes
 seen on the frontal view.  Streaky left basilar opacity is seen potentially
 due to atelectasis.  There is blunting of posterior costophrenic angles which
 may be due to small effusions, new since prior.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is detected.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible small bilateral effusions.  Left basilar linear opacities likely due
 to atelectasis given the low lung volumes noting that infection is not
 completely excluded.
