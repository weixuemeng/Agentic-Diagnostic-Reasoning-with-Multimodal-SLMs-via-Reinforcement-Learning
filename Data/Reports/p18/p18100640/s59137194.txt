                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of edema, question of left pleural effusion.  Please
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There appears to be an opacity overlying the right lower lung. This
 could be secondary to crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, however a repeat
 with full inspiration is recommended for further evaluation. Note is made of a
 stable right upper lobe granuloma.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity over the right lower lung. This could be secondary to crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature, however a repeat radiograph with full inspiration is
 recommended to exclude an intrathoracic malignancy.
 
 Findings were placed in the critical results dashboard by Dr. ___ on the
 day of the exam.
