                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain, cough and left lower lung
 rales.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded with a very subtle opacity projecting
 over the lower thoracic spine.  The border of the left posterior diaphragm is
 also somewhat indistinct.  These findings together are suggestive of an early
 left lower lobe pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no pleural
 effusion, masses, lesions, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous and
 calcified.  Wedge compression of a lower thoracic vertebra of unknown
 chronicity is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity suspicious for early left lower lobe pneumonia.
