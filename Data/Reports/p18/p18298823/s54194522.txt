                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of NASH cirrhosis complicated by
 HCC, status post liver transplant now presenting with fever to 101.  Evaluate
 for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semiupright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Reference is made to
 the chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding.  A right pleural effusion
 is probably moderate in size.  There is likely associated compressive
 atelectasis.  No evidence of the left pleural effusion.  Opacity in the right
 lower lobe of consolidation is again seen.  Heart size cannot be accurately
 assessed on this single AP view and low lung volumes, probably normal.  No
 edema or pneumothorax.  Asymmetric right apical pleural thickening with an
 apical opacity/mass is better appreciated on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Right lower lobe opacity similar to prior chest CT.
 
 3.  Right apical pleural thickening and mass seen on prior chest CT.
 
 4.  Low lung volumes.
