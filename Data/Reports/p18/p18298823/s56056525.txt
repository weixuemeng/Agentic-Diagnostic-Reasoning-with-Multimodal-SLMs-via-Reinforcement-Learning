 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion appears decreased as compared to the
 prior study.  There appears to be some volume loss of the right lung although
 there is improved aeration as compared to the prior study. The left lung is
 clear.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  No definite focal consolidation. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small moderate right pleural effusion appears decreased compared to the prior
 study ; underlying right base consolidation/pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
 Some continued volume loss of the right lung, but with significantly improved
 aeration as compared to the prior study.
