                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post TIPS. Evaluate for subdiaphragmatic air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, there has been improved aeration of the right upper
 lobe.  There is still a large right pleural effusion and associated
 atelectasis.  The left lung is essentially clear. There is no left pleural
 effusion. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There
 is no free air below the hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
 2.  Interval improvement in the aeration of the right upper lung, likely due
 to a slightly decrease in size of the large right pleural effusion.
