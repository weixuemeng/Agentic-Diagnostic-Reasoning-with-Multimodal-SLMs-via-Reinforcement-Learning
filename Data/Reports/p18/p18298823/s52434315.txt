                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with confusion, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from ___, there is now complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax, likely due to reaccumulation of known
 large right pleural effusion/hepatic hydrothorax, with complete right lung
 collapse.  There is mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures, similar to
 prior exams. The visible cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Increased
 left central bronchovascular prominence and diffusely prominent interstitial
 markings throughout the left lung are compatible with pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild pulmonary edema. There are no focal lung consolidations.
 There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema involving left lung.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.
 2. Complete opacification of right hemithorax, consistent with re-accumulation
 of known large right pleural effusion.
