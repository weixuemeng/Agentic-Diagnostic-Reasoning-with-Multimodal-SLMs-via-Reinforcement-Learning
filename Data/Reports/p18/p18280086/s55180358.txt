                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new oxygen requirement, tachypnea  // eval
 for pna, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild fluid
 overload/ CHF. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Hazy density adjacent to this
 could represent a small left effusion. There is patchy opacity at the right
 lung base, which is more pronounced on the current examination, with minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. CHF, more pronounced on the current film, with small bilateral effusions.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and increased patchy opacity
 at the right base. While this could relate to the presence of CHF, the
 possibility of an associated infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
