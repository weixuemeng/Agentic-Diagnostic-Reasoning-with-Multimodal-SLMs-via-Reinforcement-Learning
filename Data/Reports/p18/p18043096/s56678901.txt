                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm with persistent right basilar opacities suggestive of
 atelectasis with possible trace effusion.  The lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear.  Faint opacities compatible with old healed rib fractures seen
 overlying the posterior right fourth, fifth and seventh ribs as well as the
 left anterior third ribs.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly is
 unchanged from prior.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve replacement
 again noted.  Right subclavian vascular stent is also seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Persistent elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm and right basilar opacity due to likely atelectasis
 and possible trace effusion, similar when compared to priors.
