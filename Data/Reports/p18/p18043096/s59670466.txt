  Findings suggest mild vascular congestion.  Nodular focus of 8 mm projecting
  over the right mid lung, suspected nipple shadow; when clinically appropriate
  a repeat PA view with nipple markers is suggested for confirmation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and atrial fibrillation.  Question congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified
 to a mild degree.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a
 mildly prominent central vascular and interstitial opacification, suggesting
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  In addition, projecting over the right
 lateral lung there is a nodular round density measuring 8 mm in diameter, but
 suspected to represent a nipple shadow.  Moderate degenerative osteophyte
 formation is noted along the anterior thoracic spine, probably unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Nodular
 density projecting over the right mid lung, most likely a nipple shadow, but a
 pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  When clinically appropriate, a repeat PA
 view with nipple markers is suggested for confirmation.
