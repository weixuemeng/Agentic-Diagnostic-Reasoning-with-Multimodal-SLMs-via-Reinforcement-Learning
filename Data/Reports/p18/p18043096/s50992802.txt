 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar opacification is consistent with
 pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis.
 On the current study, it is difficult to assess the possibility of residual
 sub diaphragmatic air on the right.  A true upright view would be necessary
 for this evaluation.
