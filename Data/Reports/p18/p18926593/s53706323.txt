                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with hemoptysis and shoulder pain; hx of lung mets  // r/o
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Region of consolidation is seen in the right infrahilar region extending to
 the right middle lobe.  Some of this is likely due to known underlying
 metastatic disease although postobstructive pneumonia would also be possible. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are relatively clear.  There is a nodular opacity
 projecting over the left lung base in the anterior left fifth and sixth rib
 interspace.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits given
 projection.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.  Right proximal
 humeral hardware identified as well as coil in the axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe consolidation in part due to known underlying metastatic
 disease with possible superimposed postobstructive infection or atelectasis.
 Nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base, potentially nipple shadow
 however continued followup of this region will be necessary especially in
 light of patient's history.
