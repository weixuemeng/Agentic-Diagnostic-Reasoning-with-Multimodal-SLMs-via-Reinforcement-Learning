                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hyperglycemia  // ?cpd      ?cpd
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  There is a new right basal medial parenchymal
 opacity, obliterating the right heart border.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, the finding might be suggestive of middle lobe pneumonia.  This is
 supported by a minimal increase in radiodensity in this area on the lateral
 radiograph.  Normal size of the heart.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.
