                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with HIV and cough.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Prominent left atrial appendage is incidentally noted,
 a normal variant in a young female.
 
 There is some minor nonspecific bronchial wall thickening.  Some focally
 unusually dilated enlarged vessels in the left upper lung zone are noted. 
 There is no definitive acute pneumonic process, however.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Mild bronchial wall thickening is nonspecific.  No definitive evidence of
 pneumonia.
