                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, shortness of breath, COPD
 exacerbation  // any infiltrate      any infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again severe
 hyperinflation of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There
 has been an interval increase in opacification at the right base, which
 appears relatively anterior on the lateral projection consistent with a middle
 lobe pneumonia.  There also may be some retrocardiac increase in
 opacification, which would reflect a lower lobe process as well.
 The remainder of the study is unchanged.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___.
