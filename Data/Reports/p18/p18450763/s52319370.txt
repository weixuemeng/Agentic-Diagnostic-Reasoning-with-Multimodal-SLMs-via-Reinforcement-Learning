                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lung cancer and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Neck CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are persistent
 opacities in the left perihilar region seen on prior, some of which may be
 accounted for by prior radiation changes.  There is however a region which
 appears more dense than on prior which raises possibility of superimposed mass
 growth or infection.  There is a new moderate left-sided pleural effusion. 
 Right upper lung parenchymal opacity has increased.  Increased interstitial
 markings also seen throughout the right lung which have slightly progressed
 since prior, potentially interstial edema although infection or tumor are
 possible.
 
 Given the significant change since prior, CT scan could be considered to
 further characterize these findings.
