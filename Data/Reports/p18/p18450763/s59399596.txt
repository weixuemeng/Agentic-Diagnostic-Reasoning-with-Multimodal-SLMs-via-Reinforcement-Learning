 No prior chest radiograph, reference made to PET-CT from ___.  Also
 reference made to chest CT plus scout image from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle right apical opacity is similar in appearance as compared to
 the scout image from CT from ___ and may relate to apical pleural
 thickening.  Left basilar opacities seen on recent prior CT are better
 assessed on CT.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated which may relate to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
