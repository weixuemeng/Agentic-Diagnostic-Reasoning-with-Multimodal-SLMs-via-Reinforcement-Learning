                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations, fever.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, PET-CT from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, more pronounced
 from ___, which is concerning for developing pneumonia rather
 than atelectasis superimposed on a pre-existing lesion as seen on the prior
 PET-CT.  A subtle right apical opacity is again seen and may relate to apical
 pleural thickening.  The lungs continue to be hyperinflated, likely
 representing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is concerning for
 developing pneumonia rather than atelectasis superimposed on a pre-existing
 lesion as seen on the prior PET-CT.
