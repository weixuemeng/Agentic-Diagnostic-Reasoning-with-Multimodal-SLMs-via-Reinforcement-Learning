                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS, cough, fever // focalopacity (s/p IVF
 resuscitation)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasalar opacification likely
 represents atelectasis or aspiration. Superimposed infection could be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small left-sided pleural
 effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasalar opacification likely represents atelectasis or aspiration, however
 superimposed infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
