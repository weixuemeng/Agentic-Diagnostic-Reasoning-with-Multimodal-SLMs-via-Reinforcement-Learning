                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no priors for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm obscuring the view.  Given
 this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly
 unremarkable.  There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process seen, given that the patient's arm overlies the chest
 on the lateral view.
