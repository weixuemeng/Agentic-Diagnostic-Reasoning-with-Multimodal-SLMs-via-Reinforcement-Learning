                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and hyperglycemia.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a rotated
 patient to the left.  Apparent discrepancy in lung attenuation may be related
 to amount of overlying breast tissue.  Allowing for such, the lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion,
 particularly on the lateral view.  Assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is somewhat limited but likely within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence to suggest acute cardiopulmonary process.
