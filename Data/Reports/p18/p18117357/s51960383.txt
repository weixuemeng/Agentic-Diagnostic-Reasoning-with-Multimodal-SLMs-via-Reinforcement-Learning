                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness on chemotherapy to treat metastatic pancreatic
 cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 convex appearance of the right upper mediastinal contour appears unchanged and
 was shown to reflect tortuosity of the right innominate artery on the prior
 CT.  Streaky opacities in the lower lungs and plate-like opacification in the
 lingula appear similar and suggest minor atelectasis or scarring.  Streaky
 posterior opacities on the lateral view appears somewhat more prominent than
 on the prior radiographs, however, but appear fairly similar to a lateral
 scout view from a recent prior CT.  Accordingly atelectasis is suspected. 
 Moderate degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine. 
 Degenerative changes also which effect each shoulder, particularly the right
 side.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky posterior basilar opacification, somewhat increased but
 probably compatible with atelectasis; infection is doubted but hard to
 completely exclude, however.
