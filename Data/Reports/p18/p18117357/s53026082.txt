 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Small-to-moderate left pleural
 effusion with  mild pleural thickening and pleural scar, combined to a small
 atelectasis at the mid left lung level.  The aspect of the cardiac silhouette
 is not visible.
 
 Moderate widening of the right upper mediastinum, potentially caused by a
 vascular structure or a retrosternal goiter.  Additional ultrasound could
 clarify this change.
 
 No acute lung changes.  Minimal scarring at the lung apices.  No pneumonia, no
 pulmonary edema.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
