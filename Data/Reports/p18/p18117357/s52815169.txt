                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and complicated
 with pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for interval change since diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior chest radiographs, there is interval
 improvement in bilateral hilar prominence and bilateral interstitial markings.
 The right lung shows some discoid atelectasis in the mid and lower lung fields
 as well as a small pleural effusion. A moderate pleural effusion is
 redemonstrated in the left lung with associated moderate lower lobe
 atelectasis. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  A left-sided PICC line ends in the mid subclavian region in
 unchanged position compared with prior exam.
 
 Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Moderate
 left sided pleural effusion with associated moderate left lower lobe
 atelectasis is minimally improved.
