                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with AFib and pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
 now with shortness of breath.  Rule out pneumonia or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Compared to the prior radiograph, there is
 no significant change.  Small right pleural effusion and moderate left pleural
 effusion with associated bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.  Left PICC ends
 in the axillary vein, unchanged.  No new focal opacities are noted. Bulge in
 the right upper mediastinal conture and contralateral deviation of the trachea
 are caused by tortuous, and possibly dilated, head and neck vessels and
 possibly a goiter or less common cervicomediastinal mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Stable exam from the prior day and with no evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Possible goiter or, less commonly, other right cervicomediastinal mass
 displacing the trachea. Suggest clinical examination of the neck to see if
 ultrasound other imaging is necessary.
