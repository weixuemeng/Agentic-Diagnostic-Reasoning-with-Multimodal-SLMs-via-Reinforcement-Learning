 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 Multiple calcified densities are again visualized in bilateral hila consistent
 with calcified lymph nodes seen previously in ___.  Previously
 visualized bilateral lung nodules are also better delineated on prior
 dedicated chest CT.  Otherwise, the lungs are without any focal
 consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains normal.  Osseous structures are grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Again visualized are bilateral calcified hilar nodes consistent with
 patient's history of prior granulomatous disease.
