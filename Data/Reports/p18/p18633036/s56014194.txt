                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact, and the patient is status post CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild
 interstitial opacities are unchanged from ___.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions, not present on most recent prior, and left
 basilar opacification, possibly reflecting atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural
 effusions. Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
