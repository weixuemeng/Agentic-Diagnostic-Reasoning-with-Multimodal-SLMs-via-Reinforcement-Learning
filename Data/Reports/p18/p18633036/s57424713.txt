                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG with wheezing, question
 infiltrate, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 13:01.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:56 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours remain enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflecting a small
 effusion.  Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base is concerning for
 either atelectasis or an early pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 Followup imaging may be helpful to further delineate the etiology for this
 finding.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
