                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath  // Pulmonary
 pathology      Pulmonary pathology
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fibrosis in the right upper lobe is responsible for severe volume loss causing
 considerable rightward mediastinal shift and rotation.  This can be seen with
 previous tuberculosis or radiation.  Reactivation infection should be
 investigated clinically and by comparison to prior chest radiographs,
 currently unavailable.  Because of the change in orientation of the
 mediastinum dilatation of the ascending aorta is not excluded although the
 arch and descending aorta are normal.  The heart is normal size.
 
 Emphysema, most readily visible in the left upper lobe could be primary or
 entirely compensatory. The lower lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
 
 Lateral view shows irregularity and posterior displacement of the trachea,
 perhaps by a pretracheal mass Some of this may be artifactual due to
 mediastinal rotation, but it must be evaluated. Chest CT is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Nurse ___ in the
 abscence of Dr ___ by telephone on ___ at 3:55PM, 20 minutes after
 the doctor's office was called immediately following discovery of the
 findings.
