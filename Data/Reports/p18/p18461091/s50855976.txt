                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  Persistent cough.
 
 Two views.  Comparison with the previous study of ___.
 
 Opacities in the right upper lobe and middle lobe and evidence for volume loss
 in the right upper lobe persist.  The heart and mediastinal structures are
 unchanged.  There is now blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus and
 probably the left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly.  The bony thorax is grossly
 intact.  Compared with the previous study, blunting of the costophrenic angles
 is new.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lung opacities and volume loss.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic sulci, consistent with pleural fluid.
