                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with metastatic breast
 cancer, pleural effusion, recent pericardial effusion, requiring pericardial
 drain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears to be similar to the prior study including the right
 mediastinal shift.  Slight improvement in right lung aeration is present. 
 Pleural effusion is large on the right and moderate to large on the left. 
 Several pulmonary nodules are suspected in the left lung and potentially can
 be better seen on the cross-sectional imaging.  There is no pneumothorax.
