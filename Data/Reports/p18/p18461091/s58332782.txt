                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 8:10 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lung cancer, now status post drain for
 pericardial effusion and possible pneumonia.  Comparison is made to the
 patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable chest film dated ___ at 811 annotated as right side up is
 submitted for interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place.  There has been interval removal
 of a right basilar chest tube.  There is a catheter overlying the base of the
 heart, presumably related to a recently placed pericardial drain for a
 pericardial effusion.  There continues to be a right pleural effusion and soft
 tissue opacity in the right hilar and paratracheal areas, which could
 represent fluid which is layering dependently given patient's positioning on
 the study as well as in combination with a decrease in right lung aeration. 
 The medial opacities also could represent tumor progression or pneumonia. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  The left lung remains grossly clear with the
 exception of some streaky and patchy opacities at the base which likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Assessment of the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to the right-sided
 opacities.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
