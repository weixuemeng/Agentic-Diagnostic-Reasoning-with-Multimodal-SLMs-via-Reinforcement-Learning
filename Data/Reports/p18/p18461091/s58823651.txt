                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of effusion.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a left chest wall
 port with the catheter terminating in the low SVC, unchanged.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there is again a large right pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis and likely right middle and lower lobe collapse.  The left lung is
 well aerated and has no focal opacities.  No left-sided pleural effusion is
 seen.  The airway is midline.  The cardiac and mediastinal contour is normal. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion which taking into account changes in
 patient positioning, is relatively unchanged since the prior study from
 ___.  No left lung abnormality.
