                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic lung cancer with new right-sided
 thoracentesis.  Please assess for pneumothorax and/or residual right-sided
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 chest CT from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and Lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right heart border is obscured by the elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  Again seen are persistent coarse reticular opacities in the
 right upper and right middle lobes, likely secondary to residual tumor and/or
 radiation fibrosis.  Widened mediastinum is consistent with extensive
 lymphadenopathy.  There has been significant interval improvement of the large
 right pleural effusion compared to the recent CT; however, with residual
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung appears clear.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath which
 terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Significant interval improvement of the large right pleural effusion
 compared to the CT from ___. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be secondary to
 subpulmonic fluid, phrenic nerve palsy, radiation fibrosis and/or volume loss.
