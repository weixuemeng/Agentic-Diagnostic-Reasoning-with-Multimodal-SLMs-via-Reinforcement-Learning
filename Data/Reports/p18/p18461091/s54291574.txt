                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Active breast cancer, tachycardia, and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is poorly assessed, but there appears to be
 interval slight enlargement of the left cardiac silhouette since the most
 recent prior study.  There has also been slight increase in the right pleural
 effusion with decrease in the right aerated lung.  Persistent right medial
 opacities may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia or tumor progression cannot
 be excluded. The left lung remains clear.  Again seen is a right Port-A-Cath
 with tip terminating in the low SVC. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight enlargement of the left cardiac silhouette with slight
 increase in right pleural effusion.
