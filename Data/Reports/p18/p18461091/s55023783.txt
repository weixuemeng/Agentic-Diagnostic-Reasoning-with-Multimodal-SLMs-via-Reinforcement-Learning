                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, while on chemotherapy, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CT performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable right upper lobe opacification likely representing a
 combination of tumor infiltration and collapse.  New opacifications of the
 bilateral lung bases, right greater than left, possibly representing
 lymphangitic spread of tumor versus superimposed infectious process.  Left
 border of the cardiomediastinal and hilar structures is unremarkable.  Right
 border is not well assessed due to opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right upper lobe opacification.  New bibasilar
 opacifications,right greater than left, likely represent tumor infiltrate
 versus infection.
