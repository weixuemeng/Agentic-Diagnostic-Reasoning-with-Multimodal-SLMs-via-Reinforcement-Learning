                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___ as well as a CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea on exertion for one week,
 status post pleural effusion drainage 1 month prior, question worsening
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Port-A-Cath is again
 seen overlying the left chest wall with catheter tip extending to the level of
 the low SVC.  There is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax
 which is concerning for large pleural effusion.  Slight shift of midline
 structures to the left is evident.  There is minimal residual aeration within
 the right mid lung.  The left lung remains clear.  Heart size cannot be
 accurately assessed.  Bony structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax is most
 compatible with large right pleural effusion.
