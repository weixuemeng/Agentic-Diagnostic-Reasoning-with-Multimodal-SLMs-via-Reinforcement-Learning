                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs on chemotherapy,
 now with fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is decreased opacification at the right upper lobe from
 ___ with persistent coarse reticular opacities in the right
 upper and middle lobes, which may represent lymphangitic spread of tumor
 versus resolving post-obstructive pneumonia.  There is no significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The left cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  A left Port-A-Cath is unchanged with the tip
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved right upper lobe opacification from ___.
 2.  Persistent coarse reticular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes
 may represent resolving post-obstructive pneumonia although tumor infiltrate
 is not excluded.
