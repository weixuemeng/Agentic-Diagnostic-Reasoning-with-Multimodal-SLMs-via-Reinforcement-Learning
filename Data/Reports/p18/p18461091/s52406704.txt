 consolidation.  A small right pleural effusion is noted on the lateral view. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged.  A left Port-A-Cath is in similar position with the tip
 terminating in the low SVC.

 from ___, likely represent infiltrative tumor though a superimposed
