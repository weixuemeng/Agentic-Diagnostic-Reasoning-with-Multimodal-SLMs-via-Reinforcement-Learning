                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Faint opacity in the right
 costophrenic angle is seen only on the AP view.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, hilar, and
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal opacity in the right costophrenic sulcus could
 represent pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
