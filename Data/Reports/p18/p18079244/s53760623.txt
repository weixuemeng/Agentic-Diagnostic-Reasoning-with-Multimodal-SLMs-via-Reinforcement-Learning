                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral lower extremity edema and shortness of breath with chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The lung volumes are low.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions, which are best depicted on the lateral
 view.  A band-like opacity in the right mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions; these appear decreased,
 however, since the most recent prior examination.
