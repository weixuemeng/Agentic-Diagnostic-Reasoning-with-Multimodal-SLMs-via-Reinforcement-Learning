                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and PA and lateral
 chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Patchy opacities within the bilateral lung
 bases are new from prior examination.  Differential considerations include
 early developing pneumonia and/or pulmonary congestion.  Upper lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion is identified.  There is no overt interstitial
 edema.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged from prior.  A previously described nodular opacity within the left
 mid lung is not well seen on the current examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Patchy bibasilar opacities may be due to early pneumonia and/or vascular
 congestion.
