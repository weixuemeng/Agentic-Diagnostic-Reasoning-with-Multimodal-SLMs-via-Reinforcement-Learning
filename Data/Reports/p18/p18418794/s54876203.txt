 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:25 PM
  Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis and right mid-lung linear
  atelectasis.   Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, allowing for
  supine technique on current radiograph.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
  persists.  NG tube passes at least below the level of the diaphragm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing O2 requirement, question mucus plugs versus agitation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is marked prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Splaying of the carina suggests prominent left
 atrial enlargement.  There is blurring, likely reflecting motion.  Allowing
 for this, there is patchy retrocardiac opacity and scattered plate-like
 atelectasis. There is possible subtle pulmonary congesion, as before, but
 doubt overt CHF.  No gross effusion.  Doubt pneumothorax. Increased rightward
 bowing of the trachea may be an artifact of oblique and lordotic positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Allowing for differences in technique, the
 appearances are similar to ___ at 13:50 p.m.
