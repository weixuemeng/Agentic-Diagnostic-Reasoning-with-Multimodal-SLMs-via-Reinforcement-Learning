                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post laminectomy, please evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes
 with interval resolution of pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is evident
 as well as bandlike atelectasis in the right upper lobe and retrocardiac
 region. Cardiomegaly is stable.  The appearance of widened mediastinum is
 decreased compared to prior study and is likely exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolved pulmonary edema.
