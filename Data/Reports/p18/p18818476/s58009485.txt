                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent pericardial
 effusion and shortness of breath and leukocytosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is noted, substantial, unchanged.  Pleural effusion is noted,
 bilateral.  Left lower lobe consolidation appears to be even more pronounced
 than on the prior study, most likely related to progression of infectious
 process.  Upper lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased cardiac silhouette, when compared to ___, appears to
 be unchanged, but there is interval progression of left lower lobe
 consolidation and still present bilateral pleural effusions.
