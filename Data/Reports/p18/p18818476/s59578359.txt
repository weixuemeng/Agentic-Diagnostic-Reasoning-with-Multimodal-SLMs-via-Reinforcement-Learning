 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and questionably wide mediastinum

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___
 obtained at an outside hospital (___).  Comparison
 is made to multiple radiographs, dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are
 relatively well expanded, with some atelectasis and either pleural scarring or
 a prominent epipericardial fat pad on the left.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusion on the right, and no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or focal
 air space consolidation is seen.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is no specific
 evidence of mediastinal widening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal mediastinum.   Left basilar atelectasis and possible left
 pleural scarring, along with mild cardiomegaly.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
