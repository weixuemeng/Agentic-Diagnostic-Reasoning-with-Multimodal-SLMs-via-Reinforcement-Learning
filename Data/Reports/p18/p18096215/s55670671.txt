                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagogectomy  // eval for pleural
 effusions, ptx, pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study, the small right apical pneumothorax
 and trace left apical hydropneumothorax are unchanged. There is persistent
 severe swelling at the surgical site at the level of the clavicles with
 leftward tracheal deviation. Decreased lung volumes on the right cause right
 basilar atelectasis, and there may be a new small left pleural effusion. The
 enteric tube ends within the remnant esophagus. A right-sided chest tube and a
 left paravertebral JP drain are in unchanged positions. There are no focal
 consolidations or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax and trace left apical
 hydropneumothorax.
 2. Probable new small left pleural effusion.
 3. No focal consolidations or edema.
