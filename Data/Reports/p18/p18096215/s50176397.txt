 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer // ptx, effusion

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study, the patient has undergone esophageal

 and ends within the gastroesophageal anastomosis. There is leftward tracheal
 deviation most likely due to postoperative swelling. A left paramidline drain
 is noted. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Allowing for rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is probably within normal limits.
