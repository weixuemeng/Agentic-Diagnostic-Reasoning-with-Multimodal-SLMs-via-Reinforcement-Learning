 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post esophagectomy with gastric pull-through. Large right
 superior mediastinal mass is re- demonstrated, unchanged from the previous
 exam, with deviation of the trachea leftward. Heart size appears unchanged,
 and within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
 There is a small to moderate right and small left, partially loculated,
 pleural effusions, not substantially changed in the interval. Bibasilar
 airspace opacities also persist, more pronounced on the right, likely
 reflective of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from prior. Status post esophagectomy with
 gastric pull-through. Right superior mediastinal mass and bilateral partially
 loculated pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis are relatively
 unchanged.
