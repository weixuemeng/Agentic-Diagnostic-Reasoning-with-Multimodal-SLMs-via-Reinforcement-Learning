                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with acute onset weakness, history of lymphoma, poor
 historian
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases which likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is present.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
