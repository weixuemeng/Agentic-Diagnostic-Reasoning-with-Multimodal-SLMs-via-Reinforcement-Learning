                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with
 mural calcification of the aortic arch.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Minimal streaky opacities are demonstrated in the right lung base
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  Clips are
 noted within the upper abdomen.  Deformity of the right distal clavicle is
 compatible with remote trauma.  Degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular
 and glenohumeral joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the right lung base.  No evidence for pneumonia or
 congestive heart failure.
