                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent operation.  Please evaluate for fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly has been stable compared to exams dated back

 has been an interval increase in left basilar opacification.  There is also an
 increase in small right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax. Nodule previously identified near the left hilus is not well
 visualized on this study, possibly obscured by vascular congenstion and
 infiltrate/atelectasis.

 1.  Interval increase in opacity at the left lung base is concerning for
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Interval increase in small right pleural effusion.
