                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of intracranial hemorrhage, presenting with
 altered mental status.
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are bilateral
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  There is mild interstitial
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 unfolded.  There is a single-lead left-sided pacemaker with leads in the
 expected position of the right ventricle.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and minimal
 interstitial edema suggests fluid overload.
