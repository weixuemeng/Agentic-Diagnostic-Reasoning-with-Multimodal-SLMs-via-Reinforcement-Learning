 hemorrhage.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe acute consolidation restricted virtually to the right lung

 Heart is normal size.  Minimal interstitial abnormality at the base of the
 left lung could represent the same process as more severely affects the right.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  ET tube in standard placement. 
 An upper enteric drainage tube would need to be advanced 6 cm to move all the
 side ports into the stomach.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by
