  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position ending approximately 3.1 cm above
  the carina. Bronchovascular crowding and apparent enlargement of the
  cardiomediastinal silhouette likely secondary to very low lung volumes. No
  pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Partially visualized oral contrast
  from prior CT within the abdomen.

 tube position, any cardiopulomonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by low lung volumes. ET tube is in
 standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  opacities in the lower lobes left greater than
 right could be atelectasis and or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or
