 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment.  Allowing for this, the lungs appear clear.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of edema.  The heart appears
 mildly prominent though this could in part reflect magnification given
 technique.  Tiny surgical clips are noted in the left axilla.  The imaged bony
 structures are intact.  No signs of free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings on this limited exam.
