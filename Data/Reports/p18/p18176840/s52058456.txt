 left greater than right, opacities consistent with atelectasis, though
 aspiration or infection can have a similar appearance. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.

 opacity may be atelectasis but additional area of aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
