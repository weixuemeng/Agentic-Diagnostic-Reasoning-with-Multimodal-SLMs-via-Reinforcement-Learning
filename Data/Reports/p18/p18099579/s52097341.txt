                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with coarse diffuse interstitial opacities and
 bronchiectasis noted bilaterally, concerning for chronic ___ infection as seen
 on the previous chest CT, and slightly progressed since the prior chest
 radiograph.  Additionally, a fiducial marker is noted within a spiculated
 opacity in the right lower lobe, which overall has increased in size compared
 to the previous study now measuring approximately 4.7 x 3.7 cm, previously 2.6
 x 2.3 cm on the prior chest radiograph.  There is mild volume loss in the
 right lung with a probable trace right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Scarring is seen within the lung apices,
 more pronounced on the right.  The osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval increase in size of right lower lobe spiculated opacity containing
 a fiducial marker, which previously was characterize as concerning for
 malignancy.
 2. Diffuse coarse interstitial opacities, slightly progressed from the prior
 chest radiograph, reflective of bronchiectasis, airways disease, and likely
 chronic ___ infection.
 3. Small right pleural effusion.
