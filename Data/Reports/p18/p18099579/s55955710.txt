                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dementia and white count of 17.  // rule
 out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely airways disease is similar to the prior examination, previously
 characterized as a combination of bronchiectasis and probable chronic
 mycobacterium avium infection.  There is no evidence of new, superimposed
 focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.
 
 A spiculated mass abutting the lateral wall of the right lower lobe contains a
 fiducial marker, and is grossly unchanged from prior examination. Blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles is unchanged and may represent pleural
 scarring versus trace pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged from prior examination.  Surgical clips overlie the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse airways disease is unchanged, and likely reflects a combination of
 bronchiectasis and small airways disease, possibly due to chronic mA by a.  No
 evidence for superimposed acute pneumonia.
 2.  Spiculated right lower lobe mass contains a fiducial marker and appears
 similar in size morphology as compared to the prior examination.
