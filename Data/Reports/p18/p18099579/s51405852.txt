                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with subdural hematoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with
 COPD.  Additionally, paraseptal emphysematous changes are present with bleb
 noted at the lung apices.  Linear calcification compatible with scarring is
 also seen in the right lung apex.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable and there is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Diffuse, coarse interstitial opacities are more pronounced in
 the right lung compared to the left with bronchial wall thickening and
 ill-defined nodular opacities, similar when compared to the previous exam.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No new focal opacities noted.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar appearance of diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease, likely
 reflective of bronchiectasis with chronic airways infection and/or
 inflammation.  
 
 A non-emergent chest CT can be obtained for further assessment.
