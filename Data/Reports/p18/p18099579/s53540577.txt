                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Found down on the ground, right eye swelling and coarse breath
 sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased retrosternal
 sternal clear space compatible with emphysema. Blebs are noted at the right
 lung apex.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Coarse interstitial
 opacities with bronchial wall thickening and ill-defined nodular opacities are
 demonstrated diffusely within the lungs, but appear slightly more progressed
 particularly in the right lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Multiple clips are
 seen within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities with bronchial wall thickening and nodularity
 likely reflective of diffuse bronchiectasis and chronic inflammatory or
 infectious small airways disease, which appears more progressed in the right
 lung base.
