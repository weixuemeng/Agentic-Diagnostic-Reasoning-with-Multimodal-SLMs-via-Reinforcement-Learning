                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of abdominal distention,
 status post EGD.  Rule out free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 is extensive scarring and bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe without
 significant interval change consistent with history of chronic tuberculosis. 
 Left mid lung chronic atelectasis/scarring again seen.  Evidence of
 mediastinal/hilar calcified nodes is also consistent with prior granulomatous
 disease as well as multiple calcified granulomas.  In the interval since the
 prior study, there has been development of a right upper to mid lung opacity,
 could relate to infection; however, underlying pulmonary nodule may be present
 and further evaluation with nonurgent chest CT is advised.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes in this patient with history of chronic
 tuberculous disease.  1.3 x 1.7 cm ovoid opacity in the right upper to mid
 lung, not definitively seen on the prior study, could be due to consolidation
 or underlying pulmonary nodule.  Findings suggest further evaluation with
 chest CT.
