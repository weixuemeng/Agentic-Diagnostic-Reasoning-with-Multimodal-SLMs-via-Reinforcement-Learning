 INDICATION:  Worsening ascites, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is chronic right upper lobe collapse with
 bronchiectasis, similar to prior study.  The left mid lung linear opacities
 likely from scarring have been present since ___.  There is increased
 pulmonary edema and fluid within the major fissures.  No definite pleural
 effusion.  Previously seen nodular opacity in the right lung is difficult to
 visualize due to overlying edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: New mild pulmonary edema.  Stable chronic changes in the right
 upper lobe and left mid lung. As previously suggested CT scan should be
 performed.
