 volume loss of the right lung apex. Calcific density in the left midlung is
 also likely chronic. Vague nodular opacities seen throughout the lungs, left
 greater than right. Overall, the appearance has not demonstrated significant
 interval change since most recent exams. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged. Calcified subcarinal lymph node is seen. Radiopaque densities in
 the left supraclavicular region are again noted.
