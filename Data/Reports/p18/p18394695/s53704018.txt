                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged, increased compared to the previous exam. The aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  Bronchiectasis with architectural distortion, scarring,
 and calcifications involving the right apex and left mid lung field as well as
 superior retraction of the right hila are again noted along with calcified
 mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, findings compatible with the sequela
 of prior granulomatous infection. New mild pulmonary edema is present. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Multiple punctate radiopaque
 densities again are seen overlying the left superior chest. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected. Calcifications in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen are compatible with gallstones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval development of mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Findings compatible with prior granulomatous infection.
