                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Questionable lung nodule on chest x-ray from ___, patient
 underwent for CT.  Re-evaluate lung nodules/opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right mid lung nodular opacity persists, not significantly changed in size
 since ___, but new since ___.  The chronic right upper lobe collapse
 with bronchiectasis demonstrates increased lucency compared with prior.  Left
 mid lung chronic scarring is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar calcified nodes
 are consistent with prior granulomatous disease as well as multiple calcified
 granulomas all of which are unchanged.  There has been interval enlargement of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette compared with ___, which could represent
 cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Metallic fragments overlying the left ___ and 2nd ribs are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent right mid lung nodular opacity is not significantly changed from
 recent CXR; however, further evaluation by a chest CT is recommended as it was
 not present on earlier studies.
 
 2. Increased lucency in chronically collapsed right upper lobe raises the
 possibility of a chronic cavitary process for which CT would also be helpful
 to evaluate.
 
 3. Interval enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette could be related
 to cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ was paged and called at her office; however, she was
 not available, so the findings were reported to the Critical Results Dashboard
 by Dr. ___ at 16:30 on ___.
