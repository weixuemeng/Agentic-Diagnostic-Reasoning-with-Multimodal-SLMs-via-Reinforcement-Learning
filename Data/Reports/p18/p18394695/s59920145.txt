                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM 
 
 This addendum complement s the report from the chest x-ray examination
 performed ___, 6:09 p.m.
 
 The chronic changes in the right upper lobe are likely related to prior TB. 
 Relatively extensive scarring in the right perihilar areas and around the left
 hilus could also be related to former tuberculous infection.  The lung volumes
 are low and several calcified granulomas are seen.  Overall, older and latent
 TB cannot be excluded, based on the chest radiographic findings.

 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:11 PM
  Mild pulmonary edema.  Stable chronic right upper lobe collapse, right mid
  lung nodule, and left mid lung opacities.  No new consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ethanol cirrhosis,
 rectal bleeding and hemodialysis.  Assessment prior to hemodialysis to rule
 out tuberculosis.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Right upper lobe chronic
 collapse as well as chronic left mid lung opacity can be seen on the
 examinations dating back to at least ___ and ___
 that is consistent with chronic changes.  No new consolidations to suggest
 active infection seen.  The right middle lung nodule is unchanged as well.  No
 pleural effusion is appreciated.  Opacities projecting over the left apex are
 unchanged and might reflect prior injury.
