                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and HE, s/p placement of NGT  //
 eval placement of NG tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP film
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The NG tube tip terminates in the region of the stomach having traversed
 through through the mediastinum. The radiograph is rotated. There is
 significant vascular calcification. Volume loss on the right apex is noted as
 well as a high-density subcarinal lesion presumptively lymph node.
 High-density material in the interpolar region on the left side there reflects
 some scarring as seen on prior radiographs. Patchy bilateral parenchymal
 infiltrates persist but not as pronounced on the prior study. Persistent high
 attenuation material projected over the apex.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tubes in good position. Findings suggestive of chronic fibrocalcific
 disease
 
 Patchy nonspecific infiltrate
