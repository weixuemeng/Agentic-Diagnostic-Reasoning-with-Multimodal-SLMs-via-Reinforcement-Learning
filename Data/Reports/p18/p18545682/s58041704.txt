                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now with
 PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate left-sided PICC line
 which appears to pass through the left subclavian vein before taking a sharp
 inferior and anterior turn.  It is unclear what vessel the tip of the PICC
 line is in but it is now within the SVC.  It is recommended that this PICC
 line be completely removed and re-insertion of a PICC line be attempted. 
 There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen.  The lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided PICC with tip in an uncertain anatomic location but
 not within the SVC.  Recommend completely removing the PICC line and
 attempting to re-insert a new PICC line.
 
 These findings were communicated to ___ with the IV nursing team
 at 9:00 a.m. on ___ by phone.
