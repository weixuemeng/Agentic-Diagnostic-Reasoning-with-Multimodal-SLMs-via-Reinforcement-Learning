                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post removal of chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the right chest tube has been removed.
 There is a new small right apical pneumothorax.  There is minimal retraction
 of the left apical lung edge, but no definite left-sided pneumothorax.  There
 is new slight tenting of the right hemidiaphragm.  No gross effusion. 
 Scattered subcutaneous emphysema noted along right chest wall.   Incidental
 note is made of a cluster of calcified granulomas at the left lung apex and a
 small right apical granuloma at the right lung apex. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion.
 
 Of note, there is a 17 mm rounded density in right mid lung, near the right
 hilum, and a 17 mm irregular curvilinear density in the right mid lung
 laterally. These are similar to the film from ___ at 9:42 a.m., though more
 visible due to differences in contrast and probable improvement in
 atelectasis.  Smaller rounded densities at both lung bases likely represent
 nipple shadows.
 
 Known right eighth rib fracture is not well seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small right pneumothorax, status post removal of right chest tube.
 2.  One rounded and one curvilinear density in the right mid-lung.  These are
 new compared with the original ___ chest x-rays, but similar to the film
 from earlier the same day.  These are not fully characterized on this exam. 
 While the curvilinear density may relate to prior lung laceration, the
 possibility of a small hematoma or pseudoaneurysm cannot be excluded. 
 Clinical correlation and, if indicated, further assessment with
 contrast-enhanced chest CT could be obtained.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr ___ at approximately 7:15 pm on the day of the
 exam (___, phone).
