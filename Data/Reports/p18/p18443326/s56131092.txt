                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Likely right-sided ischemic stroke.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is
 a central pulmonary vascular engorgement with moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  A right subclavian approach Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right
 atrium.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion with increased density
 at the right base.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema and
 small right-sided pleural effusion.  A confluent opacity at the right lung
 base may be secondary asymmetrical edema, though infection should also be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup
 radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard, if warranted
 clinically.  .
