                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the
 endotracheal tube is difficult to see.  The tip of the tube appears to be
 about 5.6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is lost within the
 mediastinum and cannot be followed into the stomach.  Continued hyperexpansion
 of the lungs with hazy opacification at the bases consistent with pleural
 effusions and compressive atelectasis.  Again, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
