                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating about
 5.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
 Previously reported right upper lobe opacity has resolved, but there is now
 worsening heterogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe which may
 correspond to the clinical history of pneumonia.  Heart is mildly enlarged and
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite pleural effusion.
