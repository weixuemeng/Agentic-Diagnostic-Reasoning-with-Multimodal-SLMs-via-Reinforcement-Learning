 AP CHEST, 4:48 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, intubated patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Relatively mild peribronchial opacification in the lower lungs has worsened. 
 Whether this represents progression of the presumed location of pneumonia or
 instead a decrease in positive pressure ventilation support, is
 radiographically indeterminate.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Heart
 size is normal.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard
 placements and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. 
 No pneumothorax.
