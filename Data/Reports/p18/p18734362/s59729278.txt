                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube lies
 about 5.7 cm above the level of the carina.  Some enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette persists with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, and
 there is hazy opacification at the bases consistent with pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
