                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices, partially
 obscuring the view.  In the lateral right upper lung, there is an area of more
 increased opacity which may relate to vascular structures and overlying
 osseous structures, although consolidation in this location may be present,
 due to aspiration and/or pneumonia.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Old bilateral rib deformities are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Area of increased opacity lateral right upper lung could be due to
 overlying vascular and osseous structures, although underlying consolidation
 may be present, due to infection or aspiration.
