                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of
 normal in size.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the
 possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 more sharply seen.  Mild bibasilar atelectatic change.  No definite acute
 focal pneumonia.
