                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS FROM ___ AT 9:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath and cough, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 9:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema.  On the
 frontal view, there are some streaky linear opacities at both lung bases with
 a more focal rounded opacity in the right costophrenic angle.  Although no
 definitive correlate is seen on the lateral projection, these findings could
 reflect an early pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised and
 followup imaging should be considered.  In addition, there is a 1.7 cm
 pulmonary nodule in the right medial lung base which when compared to a chest
 CT of ___ and a chest radiograph dating back to ___ is not
 significantly changed and therefore consistent with a benign finding.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Stable bilateral old rib fractures. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
