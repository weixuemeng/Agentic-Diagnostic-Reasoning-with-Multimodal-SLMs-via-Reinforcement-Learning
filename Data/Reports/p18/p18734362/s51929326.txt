                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old patient with cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs and ___ CT chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Small foci of linear atelectasis or scarring in bilateral basal
 lower lobes are stable.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary
 consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 The known 15 mm nodule in the posterior basal right lower lobe is only faintly
 visualized on the PA view, superimposed upon the right aspect of the heart.
 
 There appears to be a 5 mm nodular density projecting over the right upper to
 mid lung field on the PA view, similar to ___ chest radiographs
 but not seen on ___ chest radiographs.  This most likely
 represents a prominent blood vessel, since no nodule in this location was seen
 on the ___ chest CT.
 
 Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and degenerative changes
 are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
