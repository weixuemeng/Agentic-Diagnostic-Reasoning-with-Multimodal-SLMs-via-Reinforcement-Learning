                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Cough.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacities in the right middle lobe,
 lingula and left lower lobe could be due to atelectasis but potentially
 pneumonia or aspiration depending on clinical circumstances.  Bony structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities at the lung bases; atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration
 could be considered.
