                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube present, tip 1.8 cm above the carina.  An NG NG tube is present, tip
 extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Left central line tip overlies
 proximal/mid SVC.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  In addition, inspiratory volumes are low.  Allowing for
 this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Patchy opacity
 at the left lung base with air bronchograms is similar to the prior study. 
 Hazy opacity in the right lung, likely a combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis is also similar to prior study.  The possibility of an underlying
 pneumonic infiltrate at the right base would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Again seen is CHF with probable interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, right-sided effusion with
 underlying atelectasis and mild CHF are similar to ___.  Given
 right base opacity, an underlying right base infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
