                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress  // Interval change  
 Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 now measures approximately 2.6 cm above the carina.  Continued very low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is evidence of worsening
 pulmonary edema with bibasilar atelectatic changes and probable pleural
 effusions.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it
 would be very difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
