                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath for several
 weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic pulmonary disease.  Lucency in the
 lungs appears worse at the lung bases than at the apices, consistent with
 emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are also stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note that subcentimeter
 pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT from ___ are better seen/evaluated
 on that study, as CT is more sensitive, and followup recommendations per that
 study remain.
