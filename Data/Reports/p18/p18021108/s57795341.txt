                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, likely reflecting COPD.  Coarse bilateral opacities likely
 denote atelectasis and mild scarring.  Mild rightward deviation of the trachea
 at the thoracic inlet unchanged, secondary to reportedly known goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
