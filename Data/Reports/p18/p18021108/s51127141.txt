                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Relative lucency at the lung base is suggestive of an unusual pattern of
 lower-lung predominant severe bullous emphysema.  Hyperinflation is present. 
 Aside from unchanged bibasilar scarring, the lungs appear clera.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Similar findings associated with lower lung predominant but widespread
 emphysema.  With this pattern, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency could be
 considered as a possibility, but this might be lesser likely given the
 patient's age.
 
 2.  No evidence for pneumonia.
