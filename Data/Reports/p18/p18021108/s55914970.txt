                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute dyspnea before V/Q scan.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the area of linear
 opacifications in the right mid zone is less prominent.  Hyperexpansion of the
 lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, though there is no
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
