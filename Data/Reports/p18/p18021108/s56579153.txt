                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 5.5 cm above the
 carina.  However, there has been the development of a substantial right
 pneumothorax with volume loss in the right lung.  Persistent opacification is
 seen at the left base.  There may be some element of tension.
 
 This information was not telephoned to the provider because there was an
 examination with a right chest tube in place by the time this was read the
 next morning.
