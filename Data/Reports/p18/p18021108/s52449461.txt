                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, exacerbation, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The pre-described right mid lung pneumonia, the bilateral basal areas
 of scarring are constant.  Also constant is the normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette as well as the mildly enlarged bilateral hilar structures,
 suggesting enlarged pulmonary arteries and pulmonary hypertension.
 
 No new parenchymal opacities.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged rightward
 tracheal deviation, likely caused by an enlarged thyroid.
