                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup of pulmonary edema.  Patient with acute shortness
 of breath status post pericardiocentesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  It is obscured by the pleural parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Large bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged
 allowing for difference in positioning of the patient.  There is mild
 improvement in aeration of the right lower lobe.  Moderate pulmonary edema is
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right central catheter is in standard
 position.
