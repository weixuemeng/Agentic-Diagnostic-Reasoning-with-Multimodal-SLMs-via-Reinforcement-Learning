 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation after ERCP.  Dyspnea and

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Lung volumes are lower, making it difficult to
 exclude very mild interstitial edema.  There are no areas of likely pneumonia,
 and pleural effusions are small if any.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer
 lead unchanged.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, very tortuous and
 probably mildly dilated inferiorly.
