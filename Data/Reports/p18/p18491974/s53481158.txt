                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy with candidiasis and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the possible left retrocardiac
 opacification is less prominent and most likely represents merely atelectatic
 change.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again seen.
 
 No convincing evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
