                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New tracheoplasty.

 The tracheostomy is in place with its tip being approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Small amount of left pleural
 effusion is noted.  Left PICC line is inserted with its tip not clearly seen,
 potentially obscured by the tracheostomy and the mask.  Nephrostomy catheter
 is partially imaged in the left upper abdomen.
