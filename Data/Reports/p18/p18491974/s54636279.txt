                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 Dobbhoff tip is in the stomach.  ET tube is in standard position.  The cuff
 appears to be hyperinflated.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the
 projection and low lung volume.  Small left pleural effusion and probably
 small right pleural effusion are new.  Bibasilar atelectasis increased.  There
 appears to be an IVC filter.
