                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Candidiasis with aspiration risk.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, on the frontal view, there
 is a vague area of increased opacification at the left base medially that
 could be silhouetting the lower descending aorta.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could reflect an area of aspiration rather than merely
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is an appearance that
 may be related to overlying anterior ribs.
 
 No pulmonary vascular congestion.  The right lung and upper half of the left
 lung are entirely clear.
