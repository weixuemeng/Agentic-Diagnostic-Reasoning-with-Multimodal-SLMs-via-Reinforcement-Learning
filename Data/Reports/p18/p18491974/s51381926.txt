 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable allowing for low lung volumes.  Peripheral opacity at left
 lung base is probably due to a small left pleural effusion with adjacent
 basilar atelectasis.  Right lung is grossly clear.
