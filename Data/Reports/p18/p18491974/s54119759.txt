                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with nasopharyngeal intubation because of
 tracheomalacia.  The patient has a history of tongue cancer with local
 invasion.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a small-bore endotracheal tube
 with its tip sitting between the clavicular heads, approximately 7 cm above
 the carina - just at the thoracic inlet.  The heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip is just at the thoracic inlet - patient is
 imaged with the chin down, and the possibility for tube migration out of the
 thoracic cavity is likely with head repositioning - advancement of the tube is
 recommended.
