 PORTABLE CHEEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with AVR.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Widening of the mediastinum is unchanged and mostly compatible with bleeding
 which is not unexpected in a redo sternotomy for AVR.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 unchanged with left lower lobe atelectasis and minimal pneumopericardium.  ET
 tube ends 4.1 cm above carina.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Right-sided
 Swan-Ganz projects in main pulmonary artery.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Pleural effusion is small if any.
 
 CONCLUSION:  
 
 Stable postoperative widening of mediastinum is probably secondary to bleeding
 which is not unexpected in a redo sternotomy.
