 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the venous introduction
 sheath in the right internal jugular vein has been replaced by a right
 internal jugular vein central venous catheter.  Tip of the catheter projects
 over the mid SVC, there is no evidence of complication, notably no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has decreased.  The
 transparency of the lung parenchyma at the left lung base is also increased,
 potentially reflecting increased ventilation.  However, moderate cardiomegaly
 with minimal fluid overload and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persist.
