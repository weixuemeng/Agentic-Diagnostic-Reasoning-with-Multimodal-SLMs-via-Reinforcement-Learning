                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weakness.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exams from ___ and ___.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Best seen
 on the lateral view is increased density projecting over the spine inferiorly.
 There is adjacent linear opacity suggestive of associated atelectasis. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.  Median sternotomy wires
 again noted.  Multiple right lateral rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New basilar opacity projecting over the spine likely on the left
 level may be due to combination of effusion, consolidation or atelectasis.  No
 other change.
