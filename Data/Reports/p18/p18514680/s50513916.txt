                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o male with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there
 is decreased volume in the right upper chest along with right hilar surgical
 clips and rightward deviation of the trachea suggestive of prior right upper
 lobectomy. There are bibasilar patchy opacities with associated
 bronchiectasis. No pleural effusion is identified bilaterally. There is no
 pneumothorax. The heart is not enlarged. A thick calcification is seen
 abutting the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities with associated bronchiectasis may represent
 infectious/inflammatory process with a probably at least some contribution
 from chronic fibrosis/interstitial lung disease.
