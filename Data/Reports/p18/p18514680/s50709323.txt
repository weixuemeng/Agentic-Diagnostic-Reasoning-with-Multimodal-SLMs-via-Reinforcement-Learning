 stable postoperative changes in the right hemithorax.  The patient's mandible
 obscures the right apex.  Calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques
 consistent with prior asbestos exposure.  Residual  blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may reveal a tiny effusion or chronic pleural
 thickening.  No developing airspace consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable given differences in patient positioning.
