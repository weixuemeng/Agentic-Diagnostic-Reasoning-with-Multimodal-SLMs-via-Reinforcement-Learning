                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resolved pneumonia. repeat chest xray  // ?
 resolution of pna      ? resolution of pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left base is now quite
 clear. On the right, there is again blunting of the costophrenic angle with an
 area of opacification that has only partially decreased from the previous
 examination. The residual appearance could well represent superimposed
 segmental bronchiectasis in the right lower lobe that was seen on the CT
 examination of that date. A repeat CT examination would be the only definite
 way to determine the status at the right base, if this is clinically needed.
