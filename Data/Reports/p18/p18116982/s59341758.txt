                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with AML with neutropenic
 fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable.  Left subclavian
 line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.  Parenchymal opacities
 predominantly involving right upper and lower lobe but also seen to a lesser
 extent on the left are present, consistent with most likely infectious
 etiology but for precise description please review chest CT obtained the same
 day and corresponding report.
