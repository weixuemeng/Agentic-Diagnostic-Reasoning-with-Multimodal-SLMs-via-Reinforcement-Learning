                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 Single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained with comparison to the
 examination which was performed seven days previously.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new opacity involving the right lower lung zones, when compared to
 the prior examination, suspicious for infection.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain
 unchanged.  A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen,
 with the tip in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity in the right lower lung zones, suspicious for
 infection.
