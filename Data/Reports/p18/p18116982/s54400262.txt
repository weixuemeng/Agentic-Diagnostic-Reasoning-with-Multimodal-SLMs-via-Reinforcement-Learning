                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtly increased hazy opacification at the bilateral lung fields,
 predominantly in the bases is likely related to technique.  Within this
 limitation, there is subtly increased opacity in the right lung base on the
 frontal view, which may correspond to increased density over the spine on the
 lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is detected.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased opacity corresponding to the right lower lobe
 may represent an early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 context.
