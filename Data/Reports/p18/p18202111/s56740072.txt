                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Nodular opacities within the lingula and left lower
 lobe are similar in appearance when compared to the prior chest radiograph
 accounting for differences in technique. Additional patchy opacity within the
 left lung base is not significantly changed in the interval, and may reflect a
 combination of atelectasis and or scarring. No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy
 catheter is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively similar appearance of left basilar rheumatoid nodules. No new focal
 consolidation identified.
