                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis and
 rheumatoid nodules in lung, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 changes in mediastinal structures or appearance of thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The previously identified rather well
 described nodular-appearing densities in the left lower lobe area remain.  The
 same holds for an abnormal prominence in the lower portion of the left hilum. 
 These lesions have not increased in size significantly.  Detailed comparison,
 however, suggests that there is probably some development of new similar
 nodular densities highly above and to the left of the previously described
 lower lobe densities.  Lateral view suggests that these new nodules are
 located in the left lower lobe posterior segment whereas the previously
 existing nodules are located mostly to the anterior portion of the lower lobe
 area.  Comparison also reveals that no pleural effusion has developed on
 either side and no pneumothorax is present in the apical area.  The right
 hemithorax remains entirely normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent nodular densities previously identified as
 representing rheumatoid nodules.  Chest examination followup shows persistence
 of this lesion in rather unchanged appearance.  Newly similar nodules have
 developed in left lower lobe posterior segment.  They appear to be of same
 nature.  Further clinical workup with chest CT required will depend on
 patient's clinical presentation.
