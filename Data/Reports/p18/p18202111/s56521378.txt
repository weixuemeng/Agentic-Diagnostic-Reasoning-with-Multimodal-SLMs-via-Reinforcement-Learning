                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastroparesis, nausea, vomiting.  History of rheumatoid nodules.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Multiple chain sutures are demonstrated
 within the left lower lobe.  Increased nodular opacification is seen about the
 suture site as well as within the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. 
 The right lung appears clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased nodular opacities within the left lower lobe, particularly about the
 surgical site.  These previously have been suggested to be rheumatoid nodules,
 but a followup nonemergent chest CT is suggested.
