  1. No new focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
  2. Incomplete evaluation of the known pulmonary nodules. There may be a new 8
  mm nodule in the right upper lung from the chest CT of ___. Repeat
  evaluation with cross-sectional imaging would depend on the clinical
  circumstance.
  3. Right upper extremity PICC courses into the mid SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anemia, chronic kidney disease and right-sided pleuritic chest
 pain with hypertension. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right upper extremity PICC courses into the mid SVC.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is slightly larger. There is no right pleural
 effusion. No pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for
 pneumonia. The known pulmonary nodules, thought to be rheumatoid in nature,
 are partially visualized. The largest is seen in the left lobe lung and
 measures 3.2 x 2.1 cm, unchanged accounting for differences in technique. The
 known necrotic left lower lobe nodule is partially visualized through the left
 hemidiaphragm. There is an 8 mm nodular opacity seen in the right upper lung
 and a smaller, vague opacity in the left mid lung, which were not visualized
 on the chest CT from ___.
 
 The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. Heart size is normal.
 No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No new focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
 2. Small pleural effusion, slightly larger from ___.
 3. Incomplete evaluation of the known pulmonary nodules. There may be a new 8
 mm nodule in the right upper lung and a smaller nodule in the left midlung
 from the chest CT of ___.  Reassessment with non-emergent chest CT
 is suggested for further assessment.
 4. Right upper extremity PICC courses into the mid SVC.
