                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluate pneumothorax or air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from ___ at
 4:28 a.m.
 
 There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip in the proximal right
 atrium.  This could be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement. 
 There is a tracheostomy tube.  There are low lung volumes with crowding of the
 pulmonary vascular markings at the lung bases.  The free air in the abdomen is
 stable compared to the prior studies allowing for differences in position.  No
 pneumothoraces are seen.
