                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam this morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.  Since
 the prior exam at 6:00 a.m., rightward mediastinal shift has significantly
 increased.  There is increased atelectasis in the right middle lobe and
 partial collapse of the right lower lobe.  A vague opacity projecting over the
 bronchus intermedius may represent a mucus plug.  A tracheostomy tube is in
 stable position.  An enteric catheter extends inferiorly off the edge of the
 film.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rightward mediastinal shift secondary to right middle and lower
 lobe volume loss.  Bronchoscopy should be performed to assess for and treat
 potential mucus plugging in the bronchus intermedius.
