                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome, presenting with
 shortness of breath and altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___ and chest CT
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  However, there is new consolidation within the
 right lung base which is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Opacity
 within the retrocardiac region is similar to prior and likely reflects chronic
 infection as seen on prior chest CT.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no
 large pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Mild widening of the cardiac silhouette is likely secondary to the AP
 technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable new right lower lobe pneumonia/aspiration and persistent
 infection in the left lower lobe.
