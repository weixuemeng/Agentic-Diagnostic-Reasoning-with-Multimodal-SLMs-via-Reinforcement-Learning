                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Immunosuppression with weakness and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph.  There is a new left retrocardiac opacity with
 obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. Left hemidiaphragm is mildly
 elevated. However, there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.  PA and lateral chest
 radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation.  Alternatively,
 short-interval followup is recommended.
