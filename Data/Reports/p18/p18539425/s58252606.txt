                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New left retrocardiac opacity on yesterday's radiograph.  Further
 evaluation with PA and lateral radiographs recommended.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Again seen is a left
 retrocardiac opacity that is shown to be in the left lower lobe on the lateral
 view.  However, aeration has improved from prior with partial clearance of
 opacity and decreased volume loss.  The opacity may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate setting, although atelectasis is not excluded.  It may be that an
 atelectatic component has resolved leaving an opacity related to infection. 
 In addition to correlation with pulmonary symptoms, if any, continued short
 interval follow-up radiography is recommended to reassess.
