                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient after allogenic SCT with wheezing and
 shortness of breath, assess for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within normal
 limits.  Mild degree of aortic widening and elongation is present but no local
 contour abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 No evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.  The
 pleural spaces are free laterally and posteriorly.  No pneumothorax is present
 in the apical area on the frontal view.  Review of multiple previous studies
 indicates that the patient had a left lower lobe atelectasis in retrocardiac
 position of ___.  Chest CT examination two days later demonstrated
 findings of bronchiectasis in this area compatible with chronic infection. 
 There existed also multiple bilateral patchy confluent infiltrates which most
 likely represented GVHD in this patient who is undergoing stem cell
 transplant.  As there is presently no evidence on the plain chest examination
 that the latter type of infiltrates persist in the area of the left lower
 lobe, a crowded vascular pattern with some interstitial prominent structures
 remain and most likely represent scar formations after the left lower lobe
 posterior segment pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new acute infectious pneumonic infiltrates.
