 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior CT chest from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia and short of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Overall, there
 has been no change in the overall size of the large left pleural effusion
 Compared with several prior studies dating back to ___.  The lung volumes
 are low with left mid and lower lung collapse likely secondary to compressive
 effect from effusion.  No gross evidence for pulmonary edema.  The heart size
 cannot be assessed.  The overall mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Chronic-appearing deformity of the right humeral head/neck is noted. 
 Bilateral AC joint arthropathy noted.  Degenerative hypertrophic changes along
 the T-spine noted anteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged large left pleural effusion with collapse in the left
 mid and lower lung.
