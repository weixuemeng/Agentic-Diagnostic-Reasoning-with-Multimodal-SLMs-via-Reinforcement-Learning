                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with uterine cancer on
 chemotherapy, now with new cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for questionable opacity projecting over the left apex, most likely
 representing summation of shadows.  To exclude the possibility of developing
 infection in this location, repeated radiograph in lordotic projection is
 recommended.
 
 Nephrostomy is  projecting over the left upper quadrant.
