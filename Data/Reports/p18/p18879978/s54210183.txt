                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with AML on medication.  Short of breath. 
 Conventional radiographs obtained for baseline study and followup.
 
 IMPRESSION:  All the available chest radiographs since ___ are
 reviewed, compared to today's chest radiographs, read in conjunction with the
 chest CT findings on ___.
 
 Linear regions of opacity in the right middle lobe and lingula have been
 present since ___.  The middle lobe component has varied somewhat in
 thickness, but because of its persistence, I doubt that it is infection. 
 Third region of lung opacity cited on yesterday's chest CT is a pyramidal
 opacity in the anteromedial basal segment of the left lower lobe up against
 the major fissure extending to the hemidiaphragm.  This abnormality has
 appeared intermittently, see for example lateral view on ___.  As
 such, I doubt that any of these three lung lesions represents active infection
 and suspect, alternatively, that the patient has small airways obstruction
 predisposing her to atelectasis.  The tiny lung nodules appreciated on
 yesterday's chest CT are too small to see on conventional chest radiographs:
 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement. 
 Heart size and pulmonary vasculature are normal.  The left-sided infusion port
 ends in the mid SVC as before.
 
 Prior to obtaining subsequent chest CTs, I would recommend followup with
 conventional chest radiographs.  Please request that the technologist ask a
 chest radiologist to review them before the patient leaves the department. 
 Dr. ___ and I discussed the findings by telephone.
