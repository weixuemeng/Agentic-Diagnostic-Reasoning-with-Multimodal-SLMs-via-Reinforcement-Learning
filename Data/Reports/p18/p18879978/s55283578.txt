                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the mid and lower lungs
 have improved since the prior study with predominantly linear opacities
 remaining.  In particular, a previously described opacity in the anterior
 aspect of the left lower lobe near the major fissure has partially cleared. 
 No new or worsening areas of lung opacity are evident.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and without change.  Surgical clips are
 present in the left upper hemithorax and a right PICC remains in standard
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal patchy and linear opacities likely due to
 atelectasis.  No new or worsening opacities to suggest a site of infectious
 pneumonia.
