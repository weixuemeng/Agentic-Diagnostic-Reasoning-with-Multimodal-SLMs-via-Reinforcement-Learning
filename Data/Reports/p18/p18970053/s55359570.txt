 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, evaluation for ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase
 in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.  This increases
 particularly obvious in the right upper lobe, the right lung base and the
 retrocardiac lung areas.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is evidence of
 small bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.  Unchanged rightward
 deviation of the trachea.  Calcified degenerative left shoulder disease.
