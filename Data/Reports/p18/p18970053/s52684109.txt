                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions, evaluate change in opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube, right subclavian catheter and NG tube are unchanged in satisfactory
 position.  At least small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  Bilateral
 diffuse opacities, likely combination of infection and edema, are minimally
 better today since yesterday probably due to improvement in edema.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal improvement in bilateral diffuse opacities, likely combination of
 infection and edema, probably due to improvement in edema since yesterday.
