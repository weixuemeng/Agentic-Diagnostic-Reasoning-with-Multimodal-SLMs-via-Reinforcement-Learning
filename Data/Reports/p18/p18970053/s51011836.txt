                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with respiratory distress,
 pancreatitis, OGT, evaluate ETT position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  The patient is now
 intubated.  The tip of the ETT appears to have been advanced by 1 to 2 cm when
 comparison is made with the preceding study.  Thus, it is now just about 2 cm
 below the lower edge of the clavicular contour and appears to be just above
 the carina.  Observe that the diffuse haze in the lung parenchyma has
 progressed further and the central airways are poorly delineated.  Comparison
 is extended to the portable chest examination obtained at midnight when the
 position of the carina is better identifiable.  Thus it can be concluded that
 the tip of the ETT is just about 1 to 2 cm above the carina.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Previously identified subclavian approach central venous line
 remains in unchanged position.  NG tube reaches well below diaphragm as
 before.
