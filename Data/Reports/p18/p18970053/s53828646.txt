 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatitis, to assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable with mild cardiomegaly.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities
 predominantly in the perihilar regions have improved since the recent prior
 study indicating that this is pulmonary edema.  A small right pleural effusion
 is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right subclavian central venous
 catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  A Dobbhoff tube ends in the
 distal stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema.
