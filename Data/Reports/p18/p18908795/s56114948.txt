 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PTX s/p pigtail placement (r side)  //
 interval eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following insertion of the right apical pigtail pleural drainage catheter the
 previously large right pneumothorax has almost entirely resolved.
 Substantially distracted rib fractures of the right upper hemi thorax are
 unchanged.  There is no layering right pleural effusion. Mild consolidation in
 the right lung is improving.  Left lung is clear. Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette currently suggests the transient increase in heart size may have
 been related to volume rather than cardiac dysfunction.
