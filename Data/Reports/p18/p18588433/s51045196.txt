                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left lung fiducial and biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Left-sided pacemaker ends with
 leads in appropriate position.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The previously seen nodule in the left upper lobe
 may be obscured by the overlying pacemaker.  Previously seen right apical
 opacity has significantly decreased.   The fiducial marker is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  The fiducial marker is seen. 
 Known left upper lobe nodule is not well seen and may be due to overlying
 pacemaker.
