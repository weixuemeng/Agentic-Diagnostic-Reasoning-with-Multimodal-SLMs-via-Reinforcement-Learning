                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left VATS resection with left chest tube removed, to assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The endotracheal tube also
 has been withdrawn.  Dual-channel pacer device remains in place.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 There is some dilatation of what appears to be gas-filled stomach, for which a
 nasogastric tube could be helpful.
