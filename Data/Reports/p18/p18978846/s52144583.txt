                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lymphoma, query masses or acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences
 in patient positioning.  There is a new small left pleural effusion, and there
 may also be a small right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Continued indistinctness of pulmonary hila with increased interstitial
 markings is consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small left pleural effusion with a probable small right
 pleural effusion and mild vascular congestion.
