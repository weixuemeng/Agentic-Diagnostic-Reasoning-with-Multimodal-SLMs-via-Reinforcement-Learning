                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without
 change.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present, but there are no new areas
 of consolidation to suggest the presence of a new site of pneumonia. 
 Nasogastric tube continues to terminate in the stomach, but side port is in
 close proximity to the gastroesophageal junction.
