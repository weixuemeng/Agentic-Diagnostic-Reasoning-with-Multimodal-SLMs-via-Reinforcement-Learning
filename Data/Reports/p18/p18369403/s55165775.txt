                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of productive cough.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Large opacity in
 the right upper lobe is somewhat masslike and may represent infection, however
 neoplasm is also possible.  A nodule is present superior to the large opacity.
 Patchy lower lobe opacities are also noted, possibly infectious in nature.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe consolidation with adjacent nodule in addition
 to patchy bibasilar opacities. While this may be infectious in nature, a CT
 scan is recommended for further clarification. 
 
 The change in the recommendations was emailed to the ED QA nurses for direct
 communication with the patient's physician.
