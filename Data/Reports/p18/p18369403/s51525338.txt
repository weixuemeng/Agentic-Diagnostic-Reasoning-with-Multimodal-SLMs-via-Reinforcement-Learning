                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval essential resolution of previously seen right upper lobe
 consolidation with a possible minimal residual remaining.  Projecting between
 the posterior left sixth and seventh ribs, there is what appears to be a small
 cluster of tiny nodular opacities which potentially could represent vessels on
 end although not well evaluated on this study.  The above findings can be
 further assessed on a nonurgent chest CT.  No definite new focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essential resolution of previously seen large right-sided
 consolidation with possible minor residua remaining.  Acute tiny rounded
 opacity seen in the interspace between the left sixth and seventh ribs as well
 could represent vessels on end, tiny nodules are not excluded.  Suggest
 nonurgent chest CT for further assessment.
