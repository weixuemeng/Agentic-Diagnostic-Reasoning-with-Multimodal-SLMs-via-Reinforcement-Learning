 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, concern for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the frontal image shows
 clearing of pre-existing bilateral subtle opacities, potentially combined to
 small pleural effusions.  The lateral radiograph, however, shows persistence
 of these potentially organized pleural effusions as well as of adjacent
 paravertebral consolidation with small air bronchograms, likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
