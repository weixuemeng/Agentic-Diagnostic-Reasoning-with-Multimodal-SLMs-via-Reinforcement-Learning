                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  s/p intubation  // none
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 If compared with ___ at 04:26, an ET tube is been placed. The tip
 lies approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. The radiopaque tip of an enteric
 tube overlies the gastric fundus.
 
 Of note, there is new right-sided volume loss, which shift of the mediastinum
 to the right and new opacity at the right lung base, with obscuration of the
 right hemidiaphragm and right heart border. Increased markings of the right
 upper zone a slightly more pronounced 's and asymmetric to the left side. On
 the left, there is mild upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of
 CHF, focal infiltrate or left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip 5.8 cm above the carina, at the level of the upper clavicles.
 Clinical correlation regarding possible advancement is requested.
 2. Significant new volume loss on the right. Opacity at the right base likely
 represents in large part atelectasis, though the possibility of some pleural
 fluid cannot be excluded. Apparent asymmetric vascular plethora on the right.
