                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ETOH cirrhosis w/ low grade fever(100.1), cough,
 recently treated for aspiration PNA  // ?opacity
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by subtle diffuse
 interstitial abnormalities likely due to edema, as well as a more focal patchy
 right basilar opacity which appears slightly more pronounced than on the
 recent exam.  The latter could reflect localized atelectasis, asymmetrical
 edema, aspiration, or developing focus of pneumonia.
