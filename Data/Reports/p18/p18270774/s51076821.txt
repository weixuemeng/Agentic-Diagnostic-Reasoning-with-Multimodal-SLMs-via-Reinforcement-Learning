 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase in extent
 and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.  The opacities are
 perihilar and symmetrical in distribution, very likely reflecting acute
 centralized pulmonary edema.  This would be consistent by the increase in size
 of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. The
 monitoring and support devices are constant.
