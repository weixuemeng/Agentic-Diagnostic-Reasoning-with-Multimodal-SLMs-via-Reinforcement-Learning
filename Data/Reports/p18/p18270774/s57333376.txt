                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe dyspnea on bipap  // acute process   
 acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at 11:16,
 including chest CTA on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not improved since ___. 
 The dramatic fluctuations from day to day in the 2 weeks preceding suggest
 that pneumocystis infection is not sufficient to explain all of the recent
 radiographic abnormalities although it may well be present currently.  There
 were findings on sequential radiographs to suggest volume related pulmonary
 edema at one time and pulmonary hemorrhage another.
 
 Lung volumes are lower today than over the past several days exaggerating mild
 cardiomegaly. Pleural effusions are small if any, probably on the left.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction and a
 feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
