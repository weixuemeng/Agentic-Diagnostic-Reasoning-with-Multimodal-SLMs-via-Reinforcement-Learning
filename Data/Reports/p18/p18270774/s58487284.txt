                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS, hypoxia  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube with radio-opaque tip projects over the left upper quadrant
 as before.
 
 Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior comparison examination. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are probably similar  given differences
 in technique. The heart is normal in size. Bibasilar opacities and opacity in
 the right upper lobe are demonstrated.  This could represent early asymmetric
 CHF. An early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. No frank
 consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax or gross pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes when compared to the most recent prior examination.
 Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis, infection or mild asymmetric
 edema.
