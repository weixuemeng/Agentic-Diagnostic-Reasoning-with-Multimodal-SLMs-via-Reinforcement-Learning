                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, EKG changes, and b/l crackles to half-way up lungs 
 // Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again noted are bilateral calcified pleural plaques.  Right basilar opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is compatible with probable rounded
 atelectasis.  There are however probable new underlying interstitial markings
 as well small bilateral pleural effusions.   Small hiatal hernia is noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but grossly unchanged.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques as on prior.  Superimposed underlying
 parenchymal interstitial abnormalities and bilateral pleural effusions
 suggesting congestive failure.
