                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent pneumonia identified on
 chest examination in ___, post-treatment followup, evaluate for resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  Heart size remains normal.  Unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures.  The on previous
 examination identified parenchymal densities in the periphery of the left
 upper lobe lingula bordering the lateral heart border is clearly regressed. 
 The same holds for the previously identified suspicious hazy densities in
 right middle lobe and left lower lobe.  Presently there is thus no evidence of
 any acute ongoing parenchymal process.  However, patient's general appearance
 with low positioned flattened diaphragms, hypertranslucent lung bases and
 multiple linear interstitial increased markings are consistent with rather
 advanced COPD.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of previously identified episode with multifocal
 infiltrates one month ago.
