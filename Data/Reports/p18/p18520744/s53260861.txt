                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CNS lymphoma and renal and pancreatic
 transplant before chemotherapy.  Coughing.  History pneumonia?  
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:  Previous interstitial
 pulmonary abnormality has improved. A  new stellate opacity 19 mm wide
 projecting over the lower pole of the left hilus on the frontal view has no
 corresponding finding on the lateral view and therefore it may be a composite
 shadow.  I recommend oblique views for confirmation.  There are no other focal
 findings in the lungs.  Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and there is no
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal and the hilar and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 ascending vascular catheter crosses the tricuspid valve and ends in the
 proximal right ventricle.  I do not know its purpose.
