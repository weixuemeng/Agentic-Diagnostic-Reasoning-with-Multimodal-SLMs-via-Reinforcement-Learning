                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob and hypoxia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Perihilar opacities are concerning for underlying pulmonary edema although
 there are scattered patchy right lung opacities which could represent
 superimposed multifocal pneumonia versus asymmetric edema, underlying neoplasm
 not excluded Previously seen right upper lobe mass and numerous solid
 ground-glass pulmonary nodules were better assessed on CT.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 stable.
