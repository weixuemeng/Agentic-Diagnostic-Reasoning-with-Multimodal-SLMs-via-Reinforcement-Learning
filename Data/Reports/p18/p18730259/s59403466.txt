 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // Interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, semi upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse, bilateral, extensive parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms
 persist and are minimally changed from the prior exam when accounting for
 interval improved lung volumes.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 persists.  No large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous and ectatic, unchanged. 
 Dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is moderate with associated
