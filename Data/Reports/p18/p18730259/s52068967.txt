                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute upper abdominal pain, similar to prior myocardial
 infarction pain.  Evaluate for acute chest process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Aside from
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear.  The descending thoracic
 aorta is mildly tortuous, as before.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 otherwise normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Multiple old right posterior rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
