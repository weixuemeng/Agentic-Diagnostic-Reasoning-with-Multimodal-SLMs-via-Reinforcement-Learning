                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and abdominal pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  A heterogeneous opacity overlying
 the lower thoracic spine on the lateral radiograph could be atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart
 size is normal.  The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous, as before.  The
 mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  Old right posterior rib fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Heterogeneous opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral
 radiograph could be atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate setting.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
