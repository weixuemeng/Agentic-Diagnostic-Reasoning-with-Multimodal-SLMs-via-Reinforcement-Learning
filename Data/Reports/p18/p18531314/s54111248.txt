                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Left subclavian approach Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the high
 right atrium.  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No obvious evidence of pneumonia, though lung volumes are low and a lateral
 view would be helpful for more complete evaluation.
