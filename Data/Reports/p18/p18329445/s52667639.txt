                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary vein ablation for Afib with RVR
 now with dyspnea.  // eval for diaphragmatic paralysis     eval for
 diaphragmatic paralysis
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparisons.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:02 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral layering pleural effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Both diaphragms appear to be appropriately positioned given
 reasonable inspiratory effort for this exam.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Hardware is seen
 overlying the lower cervical spine.  Minimal biapical pleural thickening
 likely reflects postinflammatory changes.  No pneumothorax.
