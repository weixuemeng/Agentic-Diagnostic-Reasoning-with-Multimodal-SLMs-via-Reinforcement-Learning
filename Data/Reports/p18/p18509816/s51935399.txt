                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is complete
 resolution of all pre-existing parenchymal and pleural abnormalities.  The
 only notable finding is a relatively dense retrosternal space, seen on the
 lateral radiograph only, without evidence on the frontal image of any
 mediastinal abnormality.  Finding should be followed on the lateral radiograph
 in two to three months from now.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.
