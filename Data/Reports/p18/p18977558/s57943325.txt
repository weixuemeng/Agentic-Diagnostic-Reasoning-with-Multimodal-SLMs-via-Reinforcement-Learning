                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs are available from ___ and a CT of
 the torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dextropositioning appears similar to the prior examination.  Lung
 volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate tortuosity of the aorta, a large epicardial fat pad, and
 substantial hiatal hernia.  There is no definitive pleural effusion, but
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus suggests there may be a small
 effusion.  Streaky basilar opacities are more prominent in the right lower
 lung than left, but not striking and compatible with atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes, although early infection could be considered. 
 There is no frank congestive heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite congestive heart failure or pneumonia, but it is
 possible that there is a developing infection versus atelectasis at the right
 lung base, possibly with a very small pleural effusion.  
 
 It may be helpful, when feasible clinically, to obtain standard PA and lateral
 radiographs with optimal inspiratory effort, or alternatively chest CT might
 be of value, if symptoms were to persist without clear etiology.
