                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with intubation after tube
 placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The bibasal areas of atelectasis are slightly more
 pronounced than on the prior study but still might be followed and are
 unlikely to represent interval development of infectious process.
