 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of bicuspid aortic valve, chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The pre-existing and known aortic coarctation with subsequent
 double contour and enlargement of the left upper mediastinal aortal contour is
 not substantially changed as compared to the prior documentation of the
 alterations in ___.  The contour of the aortic arch looks slightly
 bigger than on the previous image, which, however, could be caused by patient
 rotation.  In any way, reevaluation with cross-sectional imaging should be
 considered.
 
 Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.  No parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
