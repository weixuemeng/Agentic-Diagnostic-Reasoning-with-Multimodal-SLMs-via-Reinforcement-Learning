                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lymphoma and pulmonary infection with persistent
 fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Evaluate for interval change in
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are widespread patchy nodular opacities in the right lower,
 left middle, and left lower lung zones.  In comparison to the recent CT
 performed two days ago, there is no significant change.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  The hila remain prominent, likely due to the the mild lymphadenopathy
 identified on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in the multifocal pneumonia in comparison
 to the recent chest CT.
