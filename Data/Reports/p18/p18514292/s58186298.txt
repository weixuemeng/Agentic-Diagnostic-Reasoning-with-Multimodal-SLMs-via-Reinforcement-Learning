                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  Mild patchy opacities at lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.
