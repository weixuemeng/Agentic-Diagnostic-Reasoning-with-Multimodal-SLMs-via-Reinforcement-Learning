 There is cardiomegaly present.  Some minor peribronchovascular cuffing is
 noted consistent with early pulmonary edema.  Neither lung bases well seen. 
 There is some patchy change in the left lower lung zone on the left side,
 possibly chronic as it was noted on prior studies.  No definitive acute
 findings noted.

 No definitive acute findings.  Probably early congestive change.  This is
 relatively minor.
