                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  As a consequence, there is an increase in interstitial and
 vascular markings, notably at the lung bases and at the retrocardiac lung
 area.  These manifest as a small retrocardiac atelectasis, but neither the
 frontal nor the lateral radiographs show unequivocal evidence of pneumonia.
 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
