 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Feeding tube remains in place with the tube coursing below the diaphragm
 and the tip appearing to project over the expected location of the stomach. 
 The heart remains enlarged with a somewhat globular appearance which may
 reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely
 excluded.  There continues to be pulmonary and interstitial edema as well as
 pulmonary venous hypertension.  Small left effusion is likely present.  No
 pneumothorax.  There has been a prior median sternotomy with CABG. 
 Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
