                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is unchanged.  The heart is again moderately
 enlarged with leftward axis shift.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Trace pleural effusions are suspected based on
 slight blunting of posterior costophrenic sulci.  The lungs appear clear.  Few
 suboptimally visualized lower thoracic compression deformities are probably
 not acute.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace pleural effusions, otherwise unremarkable.
