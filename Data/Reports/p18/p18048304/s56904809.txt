                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with history of pulmonary fibrosis, presenting
 with syncope and likely NSTEMI.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable, except for moderate calcification in
 the aortic knob.  Extensive interstitial opacities are seen in both lungs,
 most extensively in the right lung base and left mid lung.  While these
 changes could represent chronic interstitial lung disease, superimposed mild
 pulmonary edema cannot be excluded without a baseline radiograph for
 comparison.  No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive interstitial abnormalities in both lungs, with more
 confluent opacity in the right lower and left mid lung.  While these changes
 likely reflect chronic interstitial lung disease, superimposed mild
 interstitial edema is difficult to exclude given the lack of baseline studies
 for comparison.
