                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ CT abdomen and
 pelvis.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Hyperinflation of the
 lungs is unchanged.  Linear opacity within the left lung base likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 No pleural effusion is clearly noted, with minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the lateral view possibly attributable to minimal
 pleural fat as seen on the recent CT.  Mild loss of height of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  No
 free air is demonstrated under the diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
