                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a small to moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion.  Interstitial opacities are consistent with
 pulmonary edema. There may also be a small right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size is enlarged.  Aortic valve calcifications are present. 
 Peripheral opacities in the right midlung are present and may represent an
 early pneumonia.  Atypical edema or scarring would also be a possibility in
 this area.  Would correlate for patient's infectious symptoms.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.  vague
 asymmetric right midlung opacity may represent focal infection versus
 scarring.
