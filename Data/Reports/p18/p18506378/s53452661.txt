                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, hypoglycemia, found down  // evaluate for
 acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low. There is
 scarring in the right upper lobe likely related to old infection. Areas of
 presumed traction bronchiectasis in the lower lungs are seen medially which
 may also relate to chronic airways inflammation. A background of emphysema is
 suggested. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contour is
 grossly unremarkable. Old right rib deformities are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence for pneumonia. Areas of scarring in the right upper
 lobe and medial lung bases, likely reflect chronic inflammation/ infection. If
 there is strong clinical concern for acute intrathoracic process a CT may be
 obtained to further assess.
