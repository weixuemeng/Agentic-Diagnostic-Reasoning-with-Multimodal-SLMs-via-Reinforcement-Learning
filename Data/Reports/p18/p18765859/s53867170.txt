  difficult to trace.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of increasing abdominal
 girth, dyspnea, question evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In the
 interval since the prior study, there has been development of a rounded
 opacity involving the lateral right mid hemithorax with up to its margin,
 suggesting that it is pleural in origin and concerning for a mass.  The
 lateral fourth right rib at this location is not fully visualized, which may
 be technical; however, due to the above findings, chest CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.  The left lung is clear.  There is blunting of the
 posterior right costophrenic angle and a trace effusion cannot be excluded. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  There are degenerative changes along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rounded opacity in the lateral right mid hemithorax likely
 pleural-based, developed since the prior study with the adjacent bone
 difficult to trace.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
