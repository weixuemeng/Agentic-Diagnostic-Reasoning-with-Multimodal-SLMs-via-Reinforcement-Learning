                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal distention and respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility,
 there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, without
 definite pneumonia.
 
 Endotracheal tube lies at the upper clavicular level, approximately 7.5 cm
 above the carina.  Left IJ catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. 
 Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower
 margin of the image.
 
 Again, there is huge dilatation of what appears to be gas-filled loops of
 colon.
