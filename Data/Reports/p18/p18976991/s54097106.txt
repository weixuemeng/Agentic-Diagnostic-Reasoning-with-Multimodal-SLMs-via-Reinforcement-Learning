                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  ___-year-old, intubated, followup.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The patient continues to be
 slightly rotated, but there is also an atelectasis of the right lower lung,
 overall unchanged in appearance.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  The
 reason for the appearance of the right lower lung is unclear, and assessment
 with chest CT might be considered at certain point.
