                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female presenting with probable seizure.  Assess for
 pulmonary infection.
 
 COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from ___ and ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is increased retrocardiac density
 that is similar to most recent prior examination from ___ but increased
 from ___.  Though this could reflect vascular crowding, aspiration or
 pneumonia are within the differential.  No other confluent consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  There is no interstitial edema or large pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacification may reflect bronchovascular crowding
 though aspiration or pneumonia are possible.  Recommend dedicated PA and
 lateral chest radiographs when patient is able for further evaluation.
