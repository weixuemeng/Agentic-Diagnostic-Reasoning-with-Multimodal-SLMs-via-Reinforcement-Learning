 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ ILD s/p VATS biopsy, agitated on Ventilator  // Evaluate
 placement of ETT and OGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach which is
 substantially distended, as well as potentially the transverse colon. There is
 interval progression of pulmonary edema.  There is right chest tube in place,
 unchanged with no evidence of pneumothorax. Readjustment of the NG tube might
 be considered to improve the distension of the stomach.
