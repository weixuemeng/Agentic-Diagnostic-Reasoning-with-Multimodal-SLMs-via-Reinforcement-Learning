                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated slight to the left.  The patient status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There is persistent mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Subtle right base opacity is seen which may be due to
 atelectasis, but a mild consolidation due to aspiration or infection is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Dedicated PA and lateral views
 would be helpful for further evaluation if patient able.
 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
