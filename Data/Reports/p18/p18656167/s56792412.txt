 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, COPD, here with fever, SOB.  //
 evaluate for infiltrate/consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the frontal view there is still some peribronchial opacification in the
 right lower lung, and on the lateral the suggestion of a focus of
 consolidation or even a lung nodule anterior to the lower thoracic spine.
 Oblique views are recommended to better interrogate the lung bases. Upper
 lungs are clear.
 
 The hilar contours and radiodensity are borderline abnormal but long times
 stable, and not of active concern for adenopathy. Heart size is normal and
 there is no pleural effusion.
