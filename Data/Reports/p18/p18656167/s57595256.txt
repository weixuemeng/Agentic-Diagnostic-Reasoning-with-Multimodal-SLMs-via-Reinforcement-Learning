                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent admission for COPD exacerbation, status post MVC.  Rule out
 rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph from ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are
 decreased, accentuating the bronchovascular structures. Volume loss in the
 right lower lobe from ___ is better assessed on that CT, and is
 difficult to assess on chest radiograph. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process or acute osseous injury. Volume loss in the
 right lower lobe from ___ is better assessed on that CT.
