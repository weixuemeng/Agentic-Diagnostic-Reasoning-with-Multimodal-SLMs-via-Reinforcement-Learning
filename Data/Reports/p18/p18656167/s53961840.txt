                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Difficulty swallowing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  An
 opacity in the medial right lower lung has essentially resolved, using the
 earlier radiographs as a baseline reference.  The lateral view best depicts
 minimal residual opacification in the right middle lobe but nearly resolved. 
 Mild hyperinflation is present.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nearly resolved right middle lobe opacity.  No evidence for
 superimposed acute process.
