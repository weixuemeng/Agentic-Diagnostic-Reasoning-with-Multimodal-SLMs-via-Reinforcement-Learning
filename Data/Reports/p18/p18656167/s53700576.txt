                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leg cellulitis and rhonchi on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest
 CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged, with heart size within normal limits.  Linear opacities in both
 lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  Old right-sided
 rib fractures are present.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and/or scarring.  Otherwise, no
 radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
