                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with respiratory distress.  Evaluate for
 infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle opacity in the right medial lower lobe which is
 new from the prior two radiographs.  No other focal consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, similar to priors.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle right lower lobe opacity; while this could be atelectasis,
 a pneumonia is difficult to completely exclude.
