                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, shortness of breath, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases are slightly worse in the interval, and likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities likely atelectasis.
