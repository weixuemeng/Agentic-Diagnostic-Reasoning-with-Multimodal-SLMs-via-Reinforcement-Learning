                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with pleuritic chest pain and right lower lobe opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the opacification at the right base.  Area of increased
 opacification is also seen in the left basilar region.  Although both most
 likely reflect atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
