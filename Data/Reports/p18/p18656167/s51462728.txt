                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Linear opacities within the lung bases persist, and may reflect a combination
 of scarring with atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear opacities likely representing combination of
 atelectasis with scarring.
