                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GAVE, ESRD, on PD, now short of breath. (N.B. GAVE is apparently an
 abbreviation for gastric antral vascular ectasia.)
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, with small bilateral effusions.  Right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Small amount of air is seen beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm and there is additional atelectasis at the right base.  Some
 patchy opacity is present at both bases.  Doubt overt CHF.  Small left and
 question tiny right effusion present.
 
 A left-sided indwelling catheter is present, tip over mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  In this setting, an
 infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
 
 2.  Small left and ? tiny right effusion.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution.  Given low lung volumes, doubt overt CHF.
 
 4. Small amount of free intraperitoneal air deep to the right hemidiaphragm,
 for which clinical correlation is requested.  Has there been recent iatrogenic
 introduction of air into the abdomen?  Otherwise, viscus perforation would be
 considered. Addendum -- Review of the patient's orders refers to peritoneal
 dialysis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could account for the air
 seen beneath the diaphragm.
