                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  An opacity projecting over both
 the soft tissues of the left axilla and upper chest suggests an artifact. 
 Streaky opacity along a moderately elevated right hemidiaphragm is most
 consistent with minor atelectasis.  There is mild predominantly perihilar
 congestive change but no focal opacification.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is again severe degenerative change involving the right
 glenohumeral joint, which is incompletely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with mild vascular congestion.
