                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ F ESRD status post TAVR diaphoretic this  morning
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as
 right-sided pacemaker placement with leads in unchanged positions in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the
 upper SVC.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Low lung volumes result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without pulmonary edema.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Chronic deformity of the proximal
 right humerus is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
