                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath and poor air movement on
 exam.  Pneumonia vs pleural effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Increased retrocardiac opacity compared to the prior
 exam may reflect normal bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes; however, infection appropriate clinical situation
 cannot be excluded.  Left lower lung atelectasis has increased in the interim.
 No large pleural effusion.   The heart size is moderately enlarged, probably
 similar to the prior exam when accounting for lower lung volumes.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis but to be
 correlated clinically.
