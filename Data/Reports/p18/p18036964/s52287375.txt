 Comparison with a CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, cough, hypoxia, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are

 compatible with COPD.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is poorly
 defined opacity in the left lower lobe which is concerning for pneumonia.  In
 addition, there is a second area of vague opacity in the left mid lung. 
 Findings suggest multifocal pneumonia.  No large pleural effusions are seen. 
 No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures are
 intact, though demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left mid and lower lung concerning for pneumonia.
