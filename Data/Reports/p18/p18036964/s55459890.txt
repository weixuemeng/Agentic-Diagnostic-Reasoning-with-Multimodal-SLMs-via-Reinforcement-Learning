 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute change in mental status, TIA  //
 assess for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line was removed and
 the patient has received a left Port-A-Cath. The tip of the catheter projects
 over the upper to mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax. However, there is an increase in extent of the pre-existing left
 pleural effusion and a newly appeared retrocardiac atelectasis. Moderate fluid
 overload persists.
