                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right sided weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal SVC.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. A trace left pleural effusion is likely present,
 decreased in the interval.  No focal consolidation, right-sided pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multilevel moderate degenerative changes
 of the thoracic spine are again noted with mild loss of height of a mid and
 lower thoracic vertebral body. Clips are re- demonstrated in the upper
 abdomen.
