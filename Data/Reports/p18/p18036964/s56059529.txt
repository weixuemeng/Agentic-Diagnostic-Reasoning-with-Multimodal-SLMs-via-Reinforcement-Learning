 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased rhonchi, questionable pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, mild fluid overload but no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Presence of a small pleural effusion on the left
 cannot be excluded.  No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
