                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with new seizure and bleed, question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume but clear.  The cardiac silhouette is possibly
 mildly enlarged.  Low lung volumes may be responsible for mild widening of the
 mediastinal silhouette.  The hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. 
 No pleural effusion is present.  A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Non-standard placement of the right
 atrial lead is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  No acute intrathoracic process.
