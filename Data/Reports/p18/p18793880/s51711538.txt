                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Old rib
 fractures are noted on the left.  The appearance of the mediastinum is stable
 as compared to at least ___.
 
 The lateral view demonstrates questionable basal opacity, which is not seen on
 the PA view and might potentially reflect developing/resolving infection, thus
 reassessment of the patient four weeks after administration of antibiotics is
 recommended.
