                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  There are lower lung volumes when compared to prior, there is
 suggestion of abnormal increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs,
 most notably at the bases.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged
 but likely accentuated due to lower lung volumes and AP technique.  Multiple
 posterior right rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffusely increased interstitial markings in the lungs which can
 be seen with interstitial edema versus bilateral infection.
