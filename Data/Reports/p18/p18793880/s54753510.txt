                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:46 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided chest tube.  The right lung is now fully expanded.  However, there
 are signs of interstitial fluid overload, strongly suggestive of reexpansion
 pulmonary edema.  The crowding of the vascular structures on the left is
 unchanged.  Unchanged endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  Unchanged size
 of the cardiac silhouette.
