  Heterogeneous bibasilar opacities are not significantly changed compared to
  the most recent radiograph from ___, although are decreased compared
  to radiographs from ___, likely atelectasis versus resolving
  aspiration.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions, evidenced by blunting
  of the posterior costophrenic sulci.  No definite pneumothorax.  Right-sided
  rib fractures, as before.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
  ___ at 00:25 on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous, lower lobe predominant opacities are relatively
 similar compared to the prior exam, but are markedly improved compared to
 ___ radiograph.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and peribronchial cuffing. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small in size.  Linear atelectasis in the
 right middle lobe region is incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving heterogeneous bilateral lower lobe opacities, which could be due
 to atelectasis and/or aspiration.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
