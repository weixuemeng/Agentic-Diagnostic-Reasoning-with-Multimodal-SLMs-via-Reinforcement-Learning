                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is linear
 density in the region of the right middle lobe, similar to that seen
 previously, likely representing subsegmental right middle lobe atelectasis. 
 There is no definite consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour
 appears stable and within normal limits.  Mild compression deformities in the
 mid T-spine are noted on the lateral view.  These are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Subsegmental linear atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  Otherwise, normal.
