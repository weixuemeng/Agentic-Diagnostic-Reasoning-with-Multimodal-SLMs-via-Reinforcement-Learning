                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lung volumes
 are low which limits the evaluation.  There is mild subsegmental lower lung
 atelectasis without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony
 structures appear unchanged, with compression deformity again noted in the mid
 thoracic spine on lateral projection.
