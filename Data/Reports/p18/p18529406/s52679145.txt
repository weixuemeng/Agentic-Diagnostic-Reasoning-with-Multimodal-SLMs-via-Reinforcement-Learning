                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for differences in technique.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 lung volumes are low.  Streaky right basilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis, decreased since the prior study.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  Exaggerated kyphotic curvature and two mid thoracic compression
 deformities appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
