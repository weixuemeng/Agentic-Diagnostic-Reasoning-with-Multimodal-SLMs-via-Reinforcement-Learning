                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___. 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval improvement in aeration.  No focal airspace
 consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is marked thoracic kyphosis
 with loss of the vertebral body heights of two of the mid thoracic vertebrae. 
 Bones are osteopenic.  The heart remains enlarged, most likely reflecting
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There
 is slight fullness of the right hilum, which is felt to most likely be
 vascular given differences in positioning.  No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Deformity of the right mid to proximal
 clavicle consistent with previous fracture.
