  2. Stable right apical asymmetry for which dedicated PA and lateral view
  radiographs are recommended, when clinically feasible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with bilateral leg swelling, some SOB, and chest pain
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 He lateral views the chest provided.  A right breast implant likely accounts
 for opacity projecting over the right mid to lower lung.  The lungs are lucent
 consistent with emphysema.  There is equivocal hazy opacity projecting over
 the right upper lung which could reflect artifact though difficult to exclude
 a developing consolidation.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague opacity projecting over the right upper lung, question developing
 consolidation.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral view to better assess.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest are
 recommended when clinically feasible to evaluate vague right apical asymmetric
 density.
