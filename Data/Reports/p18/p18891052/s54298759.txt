                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with upper GI bleed, status post NG tube
 placement.  Study requested for assessment of tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, there has been
 interval placement of an NG tube with its tip terminating at the gastric
 fundus, and the sideport seen below the GE junction. Endotracheal tube
 terminates 5 cm above the carina and ___ tube has been removed.  There
 has been interval increase of vascular congestion and there is blunting of the
 left hemidiaphragm which is likely related to atelectasis.  Most likely, there
 are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are within normal limits. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  NG tube with tip in gastric fundus.
 
 2.  Interval increase of vascular congestion, with likely small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
