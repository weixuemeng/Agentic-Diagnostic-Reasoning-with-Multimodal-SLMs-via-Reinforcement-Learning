                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, presenting with fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.  ___ CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the
 heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Right upper lung
 heterogenous opacities are new compared to the prior study from ___,
 concerning for an infectious process.  An ___-mm ovoid opacity projecting over
 the anterior aspect of the second right rib was not seen on the prior chest
 radiograph from ___ or chest CT from ___, possibly a
 sclerotic bone lesion versus a pulmonary nodule.  There is subsegmental
 bilateral lower lung atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Aortic calcifications are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right upper lung heterogenous opacities, concerning for infection.
 
 2.  New ___-mm opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the second right
 rib, possibly a sclerotic bone lesion versus a pulmonary nodule.  Please refer
 to the subsequent CT torso report for additional details (a CT was ordered at
 the time of this dictation).
 
 Findings were entered into the ED critical results dashboard/database by Dr.
