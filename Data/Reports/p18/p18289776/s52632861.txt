                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new central line placement. Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new right-sided internal jugular central line, ending at the
 cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Otherwise there is
 no significant change in appearance of the thorax compared with the prior exam
 allowing for technical differences. Increased interstitial and vascular
 markings are redemonstrated. This AP view is not tailored for assessment of
 cardiac size. There is no pleural effusion. Rightward deviation of the trachea
 is likely secondary to a prominent aortic knob. Vertebroplasty cement in the
 lower thoracic spine is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right IJ line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 2.  Unchanged diffusely increased interstitial markings may be secondary to
 chronic interstitial lung disease.
