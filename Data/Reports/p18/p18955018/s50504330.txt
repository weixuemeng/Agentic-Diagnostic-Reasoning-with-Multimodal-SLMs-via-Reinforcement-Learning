 eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 22:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest from ___ at 09:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiacl
 contour remains stably enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered. Patchy bibasilar opacities are
 again seen which may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical
 correlation is advised. Low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and
 no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.  The right pleural effusion appears
 smaller but this may be related to differences in positioning.
