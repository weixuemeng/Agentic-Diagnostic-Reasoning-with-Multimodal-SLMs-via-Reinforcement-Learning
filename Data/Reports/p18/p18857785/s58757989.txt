 punctate calcifications projecting over the right upper lung field may reflect
 scarring or sequela of prior aspiration.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus may be due to chronic pleural thickening.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is seen.
