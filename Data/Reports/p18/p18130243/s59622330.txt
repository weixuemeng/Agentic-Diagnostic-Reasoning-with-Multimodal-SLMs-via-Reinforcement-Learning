                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobectomy.  Evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Preoperative chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are low, partially
 explained by the recent left upper lobectomy.  This results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures and apparent enlargement of the left pulmonary
 artery.  A left chest tube is directed superiorly.  There is no evidence for a
 pneumothorax on this semi erect supine chest radiograph.  Small amount of
 fluid is seen in the right minor fissure.  Heart size is unchanged. 
 Prominence of the mediastinum is probably postsurgical.
