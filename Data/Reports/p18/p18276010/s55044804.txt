 FINDINGS:
 
 The left jugular line has been removed, and there is a new right-sided jugular

 hole of the nasogastric tube is unchanged and still in the esophageal-gastric
 junction or slightly above it.  It could be advanced.  There is progression of
 the cephalization, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial markings
 compatible with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  The right-sided new jugular line is in adequate position.
 2.  The side port of the nasogastric tube is at the gastroesophageal junction
 or slightly above the junction.  It could be advanced.
 3.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
