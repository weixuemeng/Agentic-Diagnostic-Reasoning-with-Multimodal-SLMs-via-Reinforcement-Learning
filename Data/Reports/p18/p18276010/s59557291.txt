                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, chest pain, productive
 cough, aspiration and CHF.  Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The heart is of top
 normal size and the cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse
 pulmonary opacities are more pronounced compared with prior exams and there is
 prominence of the bilateral hilar bronchovascular markings, compatible with
 pulmonary congestion.  Focal bibasilar opacities are compatible with
 superimposed aspiration.  No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. 
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary congestion with probable superimposed aspiration.
