                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ETT placement.  Assess position.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 PROCEDURE:
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP semi upright portable chest radiograph obtained at.  The endotracheal tube
 tip is located approximately 6.3 centimeters above the carina.  The NG tube
 courses into the left upper quadrant though the tip is located just beyond the
 GE junction.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are concerning for consolidations
 in the lower lobes which could reflect aspiration given history of trauma. 
 Left CP angle is excluded.  No large pneumothorax.  Heart size appears within
 normal limits.  The mediastinal contour difficult to assess given patient
 rotation to the right.  No obvious osseous injury.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube position appropriately.  NG tube may be advanced for more optimal
 positioning.  Bilateral posterior lower lobe opacities likely reflect
 aspiration.
