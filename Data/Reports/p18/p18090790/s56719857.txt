 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the upper-to-mid superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate
 diffuse interstitial abnormality appears new.  There is persistent patchy
 opacity in the left retrocardiac area with air bronchograms.  There is likely
 a small pleural effusion on the left, but no convincing evidence for one on
 the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular catheter terminating in the superior vena
 cava.  New mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality, probably mild pulmonary
 edema.  Persistent patchy retrocardiac opacity; atelectasis or developing
 pneumonia could be considered.
