                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pontine stroke and recurrent aspiration
 s/p reintubation  // eval placement of ET tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is an ET tube which terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. There is
 stable position of right-sided PICC line whose distal tip projects over the
 low SVC versus cavoatrial junction.
 
 There is leftward rotation on the current radiograph. There is unchanged
 scoliosis of the thoracic spine. Again seen are age-related calcification of
 the bronchial tree. There is a tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta.
 
 There is essentially stable appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary edema
 with prominent central component, more notable on the left on the current
 radiograph, which likely represent development of asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 however infection cannot be fully excluded. Recommend repeat imaging after
 diuresis. There is unchanged retrocardiac opacification which obscures the
 left hemidiaphragm, representing either atelectasis or infectious
 consolidation.
 
 There is a stable small layering right pleural effusion.  There is no apparent
 left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carina.
 2.  Stable mild to moderate central pulmonary edema, appears asymmetric with
 more left lung involvement.  Recommend repeat imaging after diuresis to
 confirm this does not represent developing infection.
 3.  Continued left lower lobe opacification, atelectasis versus infectious
 consolidation.
 4.  Stable small right layering pleural effusion.
