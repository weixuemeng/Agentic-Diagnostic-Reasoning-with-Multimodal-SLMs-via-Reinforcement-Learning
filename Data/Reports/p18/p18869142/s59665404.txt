                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A streaky right mid lung opacity has increased, but suggests
 shifting morphology of pre-existing atelectasis or scarring.  The lateral view
 shows that streaky opacities refer to the anterior chest, probably in the
 right middle lobe.  The moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 appears unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild
 wedge compression deformity along a lower thoracic vertebral body appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
