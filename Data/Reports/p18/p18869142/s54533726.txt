                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is similar moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm associated
 with an eventration.  Streaky opacity in the right upper lobe suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring which is also stable.  Otherwise, the lung fields
 appear clear.  A mild anterior wedge compression fracture at the thoracolumbar
 junction appears unchanged.  There is similar mild-to-moderate rightward
 convex curvature centered along the thoracolumbar junction.  The bones are
 probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
