                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, presents with dyspnea and feeling unwell,
 leukocytosis, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is moderate
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which appears stable from prior exam. 
 Retrocardiac density likely reflects a hiatal hernia.  The heart is top normal
 in size.  There is no definite sign of focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  No signs of CHF.  Faint linear density in the right
 mid-to-upper lung is stable and likely represents an area of scarring.  Bony
 structures appear grossly intact.  An old mild compression in the upper lumbar
 spine is seen on the lateral view, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.
