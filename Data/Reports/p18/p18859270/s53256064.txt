                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Prolonged cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The configuration suggests
 a prominence of the left ventricular contour, a finding which in conjunction
 with the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests the
 possibility of systemic hypertension.  There is, however, no evidence of
 significant left atrial enlargement and the pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in
 apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits. 
 Mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine and mild
 degenerative changes are noted, but no vertebral body compression is seen.
 
 There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heart configuration consistent with systemic hypertension, but no
 signs of CHF or acute pulmonary infiltrates on this PA and lateral chest
 examination.
