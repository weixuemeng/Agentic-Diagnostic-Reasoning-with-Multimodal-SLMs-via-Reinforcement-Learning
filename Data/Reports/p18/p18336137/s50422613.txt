  1.  Patchy basilar opacities with low lung volumes, suspected atelectasis
  although infectious process not excluded.
  2.  Nodular focus projecting over the left lung apex; a true lung nodule of
  substantial size should be considered as a possible etiology and chest CT is
  suggested when clinically appropriate.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Episode of throat tightness and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart appears mildly enlarged but
 difficult to judge in the setting of low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are patchy streaky opacities at the
 lung bases that can probably be attributed to atelectasis.  At the extreme
 left lung apex there is a nodular focus that measures approximately 9 mm in
 diameter, potentially a lung nodule, although other possible explanations
 include subpleural scarring or a bony excrescence.  The possibility of a lung
 nodule needs to be considered, however.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Bony structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities which can probably be
 attributed to atelectasis, although pneumonia is difficult to completely
 exclude.  
 
 2.  Nodular focus at the left lung apex, not specific but potentially a true
 lung nodule of substantial size.  Particularly if prior radiographs are not
 available to show long-term stability of this appearance, then CT is suggested
 to evaluate further when clinically appropriate.
 
 Findings and recommendations posted to the ER dashboard while the patient was
 still in the ER.
