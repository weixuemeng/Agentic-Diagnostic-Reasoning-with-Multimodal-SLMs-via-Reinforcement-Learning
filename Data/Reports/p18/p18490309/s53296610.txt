                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC with mets, s/p transbronchial biopsy,. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive right lower lobe opacification, less so in the left lower lobe,
 corresponds with findings on the recent CT.  Left lower lobe opacification
 appears increased since the prior chest CT.  No evidence of pneumothorax or
 hemothorax.  The heart borders are obscured by the opacifications.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax or hemothorax.
 
 2.  If there is no transbronchial biopsy on the left, increased opacification
 in the left lung could be a progression of the process identified on the
 recent chest CT.  If the mass at the lingula was biopsied, then the left-sided
 opacification may represent resulting hemorrhage.
