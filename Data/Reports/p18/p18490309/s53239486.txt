 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Overlying EKG leads are present
 limiting assessment.  Lung volumes are low.  When compared with the prior CT
 effacement of the left heart border likely reflects known prominent epicardial
 fat pad.  There is persistent consolidation in the right medial lung base
 which remains concerning for pneumonia though a component of scarring and
 atelectasis may contribute to this opacity.  No large effusion is seen.  The
 heart size difficult to assess.  Mediastinal contour is stable and normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right medial lung base opacity is concerning for pneumonia though a
 component of scarring atelectasis may contribute.  Prominent epicardial fat
 pad accounting for loss of left heart border.
