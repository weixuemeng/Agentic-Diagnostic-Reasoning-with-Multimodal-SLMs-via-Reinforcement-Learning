                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pleural catheter is in place with a slight interval
 increase in size of a moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion
 extending into the minor fissure.  Curvilinear lucency at right lung base
 could potentially represent a loculated hydropneumothorax, but there is no
 evidence of apical pneumothorax.  Exam otherwise appears similar to the recent
 study with large right upper lobe lung mass, adjacent interstitial opacities
 and apicolateral pleural thickening or fluid.  Poorly defined opacity in left
 retrocardiac region may be due to either atelectasis or developing pneumonia. 
 Poorly defined left upper lobe nodule has been more fully characterized by
 recent CT.
