                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with newly diagnosed right upper lobe mass, presenting
 for further evaluation with shortness of breath.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right lung opacity measuring approximately ___ x 8
 cm, occupying nearly the totality of the paramediastinal region of the right
 lung. There is also an associated right-sided pleural effusion.  Assessment of
 neoplastic process versus pulmonary inflammation within this consolidation is
 limited due to the lack of comparison studies.  The left lung is unremarkable,
 without pleural effusion or focal opacity.  The heart is not enlarged.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring is
 present, right greater than left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right lung opacity is compatible with known right upper
 lobe mass. A component of post-obstructive pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Associated right-sided pleural effusion may be paraneoplastic or inflammatory.
 Right basilar opacity may also be in part from atelectasis or infection.
