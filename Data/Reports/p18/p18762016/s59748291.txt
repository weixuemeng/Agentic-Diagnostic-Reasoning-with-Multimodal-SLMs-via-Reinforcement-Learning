                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally
 with focal opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Allowing for suboptimal
 technique, heart size appears top normal in size.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion, although the right costophrenic angle is incompletely
 visualized.  Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic abnormality. No focal opacity convincing
 for pneumonia.
