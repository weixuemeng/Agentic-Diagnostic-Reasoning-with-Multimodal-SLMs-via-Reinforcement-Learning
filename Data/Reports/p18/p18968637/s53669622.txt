 volumes are somewhat low.  There is a small right pleural effusion and minimal
 right lower lobe atelectasis, not significantly changed from the prior
 examination.  A small linear opacity adjacent to the left hilum is consistent
 with some platelike atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.

 Small right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity suggesting
 atelectasis not significantly changed from the prior examination.
 
 Small platelike opacity in the left midlung is consistent with atelectasis.
