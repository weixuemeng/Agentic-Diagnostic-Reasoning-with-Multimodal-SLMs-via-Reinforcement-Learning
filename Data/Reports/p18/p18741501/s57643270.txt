                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Spinal fusion and productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Thoracic scoliosis is mild, but vertebral bodies and disc space heights are
 maintained.  Frontal view suggests a small hiatus hernia.  Lungs are fully
 expanded and grossly clear.  The heart is top normal size.  Thoracic aorta is
 tortuous and mildly calcified but not focally dilated.  There are healed
 fractures of the lateral aspects of left middle and lower ribs.
