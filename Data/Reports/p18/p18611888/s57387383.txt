                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of MVA.  Assess for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place, approximately 6.6 cm from the
 carina.  A feeding tube is seen with the tip and side port within the stomach.
 
 There is a subtle 1 mm new soft tissue contour adjacent to the calcification
 of the aortic knob which was not present on the prior radiograph, and is
 likely due to patient positioning.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  New mild hazy opacity at the left base is present,
 which likely represents atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Increased size of mediastinal contour adjacent to the aortic arch is
 likely due to patient positioning.
