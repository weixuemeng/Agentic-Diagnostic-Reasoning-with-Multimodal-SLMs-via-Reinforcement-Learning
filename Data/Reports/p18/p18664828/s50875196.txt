                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with rib pain after amusement park ride incident
 striking right chest on restraint bar.  // Rib fx.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 8 mm calcified nodular opacity projecting over the right upper lung most
 likely represents a calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation is seen.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe likely calcified granuloma.  No displaced rib fracture seen. 
 If clinical concern for rib fracture persists, dedicated rib series or chest
 CT is more sensitive.
