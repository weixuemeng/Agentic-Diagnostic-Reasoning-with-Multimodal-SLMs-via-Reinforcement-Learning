                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and COPD exacerbation, resolving on dialysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved slightly since ___.  I do
 not believe there is pulmonary edema.  Peribronchial infiltration in the lower
 lobe is seen, best on the lateral view.  It is more abnormal than it was in
 ___, could represent either bronchial inflammation due to aspiration or
 residual edema.  The mass-like lesion in the lingula was shown on the ___, chest CT to have decreased in size since ___,
 presumably persistent atelectasis.  Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. 
 Overall, findings suggest long-term borderline cardiac decompensation, but no
 convincing evidence of acute decompensation or pneumonia.
