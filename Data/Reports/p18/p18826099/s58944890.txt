 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New leukocytosis, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild regression of
 the pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the lung bases.  Simultaneously,
 there is a slight decrease in severity of the pre-existing signs of fluid
 overload, although signs of mild pulmonary edema are still clearly present. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged alignment of sternal wires.  Unchanged small
 left pleural effusion.
