  1. Increased opacities at the bilateral lung bases, which could reflect
  atelectasis but cannot rule out edema, aspiration, or pneumonia in the right
  clinical setting.  2. Pulmonary vascular engorgement, similar to prior exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, respiratory failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated
 and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  As expected, the lung volumes have
 decreased, with minimal bilateral small pleural effusions.  Mild-to-moderate
 areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  Mild fluid overload persists, but the
 extent and severity is less than on the previous images.  The left internal
 jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
