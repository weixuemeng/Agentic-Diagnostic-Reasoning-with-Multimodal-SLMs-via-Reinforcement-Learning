                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and cough.  Frequent upper respiratory tract infection.
 History of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Underpenetration associated with soft tissue attenuation limits
 assessment.  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart size is difficult to assess
 due to a suspected cardiac fat pad, which also obscures the left lung base. 
 Mitral annular calcifications are prominent.  It does appear, however, that in
 the right lower lung there is increased opacity while streaky right mid lung
 opacities have resolved.  It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions. 
 There is probably mild fluid overload but this may be at baseline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity; pneumonia or atelectasis could be
 considered for this appearance.  Mild interstitial abnormality, probably mild
 vascular congestion, although other etiologies including airway inflammation
 and atypical infection could be considered.
