                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___ year old female with shortness of breath,  AP
 upright and lateral views for better evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON: ___  at 10:47.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist, the patient was falling asleep during the examination
 and cannot hold head up for optimal AP exam.  The patient's chin overlies the
 medial lung apices, partially obscuring the view.  Underpenetration of the
 lung bases persists due to overlying soft tissue.  There is pulmonary vascular
 congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.  Thickening of the minor fissure
 persists.  Lung base patchy opacity seen on the lateral view could relate to
 fluid overload, not well appreciated on the frontal view, although underlying
 consolidation may be present.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal as above. Lung base patchy opacity seen on the lateral
 view could relate to fluid overload, not well appreciated on the frontal view,
 although underlying consolidation may be present.  Cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.
