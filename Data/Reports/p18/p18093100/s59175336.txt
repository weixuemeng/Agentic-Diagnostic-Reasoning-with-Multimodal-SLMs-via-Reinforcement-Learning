                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CHF and worsening dyspnea, productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved substantially. 
 Residual opacification is worse in the right lung.  Concurrent pneumonia
 cannot be excluded but need not be invoked to explain the current findings. 
 The heart is normal size.  Lateral view suggests bronchiectasis in both lower
 lungs, less likely chronic, and small bilateral pleural effusions no larger
 than on ___ when the patient was in worse pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
