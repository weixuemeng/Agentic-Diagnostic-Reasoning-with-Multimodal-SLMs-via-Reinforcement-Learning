                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior study. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged.  Again there is central
 pulmonary vascular congestion with mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.  There
 is slightly more conspicious retrocardiac opacity.  There are probable tiny
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Slightly more conspicious
 retrocardiac opacity may represent superimposed infectious process given the
 appropriate clinical circumstance.
