                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Apparent superior
 mediastinal widening is likely due to low lung volumes.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in the retrocardiac
 region could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar opacities,
 possibly reflecting atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  Overall,
 these findings are not significantly changed compared to the previous exam.
