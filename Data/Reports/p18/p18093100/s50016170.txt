                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Decreased breath sounds in the left within the mid lung.  Assess
 for worsening or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a chronic diffuse interstitial abnormality that is not
 significantly changed compared to the prior radiograph from ___ from ___.
 Focal heterogeneous opacity in the left retrocardiac region has been seen on
 prior radiographs, possibly scarring/atelectasis, although infection is
 certainly possible.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not
 significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous left retrocardiac opacities are not significantly changed
 compared to prior radiographs dating back through ___, possibly
 reflecting atelectasis or scarring, although new infection in this region is
 certainly possible.  If there is persistent concern for infection, recommend
 dedicated PA and lateral views for further evaluation.
 
 2.  Chronic diffuse interstitial abnormality, not significantly changed.
