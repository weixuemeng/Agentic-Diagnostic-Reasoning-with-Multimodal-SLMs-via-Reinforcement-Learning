                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Left lower lobe opacity is noted, progressed since the prior study, highly
 concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.  Small amount of pleural effusion is
 noted.  Rest of the lungs are essentially clear but mild vascular engorgement
 is prominent and might be consistent with mild degree of volume overload.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
