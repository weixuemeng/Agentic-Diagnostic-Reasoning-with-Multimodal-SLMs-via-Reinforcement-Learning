                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  A patchy opacity in the left lower
 lung has largely resolved, although a residual component may be associated
 with slight atelectasis or scarring.  More generally there is a diffuse
 interstitial abnormality suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  A small pleural effusion is suspected on the left and a trace one
 on the right.  Moderate degenerative changes are similar along the lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary congestion.
