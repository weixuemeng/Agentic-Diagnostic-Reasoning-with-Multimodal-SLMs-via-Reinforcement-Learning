                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with palpitations lasting three minutes now with chest
 tightness.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and apical lordotic projection accentuate the cardiac silhouette pulmonary
 vascularity.  Allowing for technique and body habitus, the lungs are clear
 without focal opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Consider repeat frontal chest radiograph
 using standard PA technique for more complete assessment of cardiovascular
 structures if clinical suspicion for cardiopulmonary process persists.
