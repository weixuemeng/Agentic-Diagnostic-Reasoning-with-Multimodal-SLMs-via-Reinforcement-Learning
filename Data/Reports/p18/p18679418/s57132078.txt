                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain for 4 days
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly appears accentuated due to the presence of low lung
 volumes compared to the previous chest radiograph.  Aorta is unfolded. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity as well as linear opacity in the lingula likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, with heart size accentuated due to the presence of low
 lung volumes.  Left basilar atelectasis.
