                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea  // r/o pna/chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. The lung volumes are slightly low which accentuates
 bronchovascular markings.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities may be related to
 atelectasis or infection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis however
 early pneumonic infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
