                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:36 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  New diagnosis of spinal metastases, question lung nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest read in conjunction with imaging of the lower thorax on
 recent abdominal CT scans, ___ and ___:
 
 Heart size top normal.  No evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Lungs
 are well expanded.  Pleural thickening and many focal pleural calcifications
 due to asbestos exposure project over both lungs. A good candidate for a
 noncalcified lung nodule is a 10 mm wide round opacity projecting over the
 left third anterior interspace.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, but not
 focally dilated.
