 are clear without focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  An oval density measuring 9 x 17 mm adjacent to the upper aspect of the

 out other origins, short term follow up with oblique views in ___ weeks is
 recommended.
 
 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
