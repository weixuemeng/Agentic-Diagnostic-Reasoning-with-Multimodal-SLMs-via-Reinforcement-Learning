                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip course may be intra-arterial
 given its position overlying the inferior aspect of the aortic knob and does
 not course in the expected region of the left brachiocephalic vein.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated. The endotracheal tube remains low lying,
 terminating approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is within
 the stomach. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart
 size remaining mild to moderately enlarged. Mild upper zone vascular
 redistribution is likely due to supine positioning. Atelectasis is
 demonstrated in both lung bases. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Left internal jugular central venous catheter course is concerning for
 intra-arterial location.  Clinical correlation is recommended. No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Endotracheal tube remains low lying, terminating approximately 2.5 cm from
 the carina, and should be withdrawn by at least 1 cm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The concern for intra-arterial course of the left internal
 jugular catheter was discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 3:48 PM.
