                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with influenza and UTI. Please assess for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___ ___, and CT
 chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube
 passes below the diaphragm mass and continues out of view. Mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable. Increased right upper lobe opacity may be due to items
 outside of the patient.  Left lower lobe volume loss and small effusion is
 unchanged. Notably, the left internal jugular catheter, previously described
 as possibly intra-arterial in course, has not changed in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased the lobe opacity may be due to items outside of the patient and a
 direct visual check should be performed.
 
 2. Unchanged possible left intra-arterial catheter, left lower lobe volume
 loss, and small left effusion.
