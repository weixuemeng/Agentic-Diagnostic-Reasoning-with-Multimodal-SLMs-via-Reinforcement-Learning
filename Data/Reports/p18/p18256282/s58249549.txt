                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia on exertion.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema, acute abnormality.
 
 Comparison to ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 11:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is stable marked cardiac enlargement.  Lung volumes remain relatively
 low with crowding of the vasculature.  However, the previously seen mild
 interstitial edema has essentially resolved.  No focal airspace consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.  Probable blunting of the left costophrenic angle with
 adjacent patchy opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the
 setting of a small pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
