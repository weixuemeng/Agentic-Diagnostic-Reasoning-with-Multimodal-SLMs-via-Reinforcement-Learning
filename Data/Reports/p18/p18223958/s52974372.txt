                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with basilar stroke  // eval for pna      eval
 for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to outside chest radiograph dated ___ at
 00:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 05:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right-sided single lead pacer remains in place with the lead appearing
 intact and terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle.  The
 heart is enlarged favoring cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot
 be excluded.  Interval increase in lung volumes with prominent perihilar
 vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity at the right medial
 lung base may represent atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration
 should also be considered.  This can be better assessed on followup imaging. 
 No pneumothorax.
