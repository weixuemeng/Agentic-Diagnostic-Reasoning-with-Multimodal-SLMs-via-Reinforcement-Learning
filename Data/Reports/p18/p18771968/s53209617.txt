 intubated, assess for infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph ___:38.
 
 Even though Mediastinal veins are more distended, previous pulmonary vascular
 congestion has improved slightly, but there is more peribronchial
 opacification and consolidation in both lower lobes which could be atelectasis
 or alternatively results of recent aspiration, possibly progressing to
 pneumonia.  Borderline cardiac enlargement is stable.  Small left pleural
 effusion is likely.
 
 Cardiopulmonary support devices in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
