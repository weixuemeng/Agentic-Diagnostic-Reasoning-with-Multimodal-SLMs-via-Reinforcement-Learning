 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased secretions, hypoxia  // Please
 evaluate for pneumonia      Please evaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric
 tubes have been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with substantial increase in diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications.  Although this appearance most likely represents substantial
 pulmonary edema with bilateral layering pleural effusions and compressive
 basilar atelectasis, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
