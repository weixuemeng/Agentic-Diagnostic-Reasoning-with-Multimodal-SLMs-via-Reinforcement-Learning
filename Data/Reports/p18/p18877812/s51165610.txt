                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 2 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new dobhoff  // Dobhoff placement     
 Dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:08.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although severe multifocal consolidation persists, there has been mild
 improvement in some areas.  The intervening areas show mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema, and therefore the more dense areas of consolidation could be
 asymmetric deposition of edema, although concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary
 hemorrhage are not excluded.  Surprisingly heart is normal size and
 mediastinal veins are not distended.  By a moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions are presumed.
 
 Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place is advanced from the lower
 esophagus into the mid stomach.  Right jugular line ends close to the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
