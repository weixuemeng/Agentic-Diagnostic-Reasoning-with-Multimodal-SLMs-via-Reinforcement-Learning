                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with afib, septic shock, worsening delirium.  //
 Evaluate for cause of worsening delirium.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multifocal airspace opacities, most confluent in the left upper
 lobe with relative clearing of a previously demonstrated confluent opacity at
 the right lung base.  Appearances are suspicious for multifocal pneumonia
 versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.  No definite pleural effusion seen.  No
 pneumothorax seen.  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  There has
 been interval removal of a left-sided PICC and a right-sided internal jugular
 catheter.  A right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral multifocal airspace opacities with some clearing of the
 right lung base but more confluent opacification in the left upper lobe. 
 Appearances suspicious for multifocal pneumonia although asymmetric pulmonary
 edema could have a similar appearance.
