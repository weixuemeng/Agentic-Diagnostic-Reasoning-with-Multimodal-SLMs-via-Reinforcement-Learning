                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance.  Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm
 with adjacent atelectasis at the left lower lobe.  Right retrocardiac
 atelectasis is also similar to the prior study.
