 AP CHEST, 7:23 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Suspect pneumonia and volume overload for
 worsening tachypnea, ___.
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened appreciably since ___:43 p.m.  Lung
 volumes remain exceedingly low from chronic elevation of the diaphragm.  The
 heart is at least mildly enlarged, exaggerated by low lung volumes and
 mediastinal vasculature chronically dilated, is more distended today.  No
 pneumothorax.
