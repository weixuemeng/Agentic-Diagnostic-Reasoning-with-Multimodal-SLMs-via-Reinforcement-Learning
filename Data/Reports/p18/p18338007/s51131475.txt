 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, chronic heart failure.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with subsequent decrease in volume of the
 left hemithorax.  Otherwise, the lungs are more transparent than on the
 previous examination, likely to reflect improved ventilation.  Unchanged mild
 subpleural scarring bilaterally, but no evidence of acute lung changes.  No
 evidence of larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
