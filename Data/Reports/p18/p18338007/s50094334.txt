                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mental status changes, presenting from nursing home.  Please
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable bilateral low
 lung volumes with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with air
 distended bowel beneath.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  The cardiac
 contour is not well evaluated due to elevation of the diaphragm.  Compared to
 prior study, there is increased pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 opacification concerning for pneumonia identified.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No focal opacification concerning for
 pneumonia.  Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may indicate mild
 volume overload.
