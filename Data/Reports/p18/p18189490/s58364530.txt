 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of critical AS, myasthenia
 ___, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive.  Evaluate for infiltrate or
 obvious mass.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 An AP upright and lateral view of the chest dated ___ at ___ is

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The study is limited due to the presence of multiple calcified pleural and
 diaphragmatic plaques consistent with prior breast asbestos exposure.  The
 heart is stably enlarged.  There is calcification of the aorta.  No obvious
 superimposed area of consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  There is a
 stable wedge deformity of one of the lower thoracic vertebrae.  The bones are
 osteopenic.  Followup imaging should be considered if the patient's symptoms
 persist.
