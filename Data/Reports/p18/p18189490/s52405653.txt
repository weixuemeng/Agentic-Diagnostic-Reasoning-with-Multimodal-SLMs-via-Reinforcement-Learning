                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques are re- demonstrated, which limit assessment of the underlying lung
 parenchyma.  There may be slightly increased patchy opacification in the left
 lung base, which could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection cannot
 be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present.  Compression deformities at the thoracolumbar
 junction remain unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis though infection
 is difficult to exclude.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are compatible
 with prior asbestos exposure and limit the assessment of the underlying lung
 parenchyma.
