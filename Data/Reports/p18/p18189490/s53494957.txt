                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall with unknown downtime.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lung
 volumes are relatively low. Calcifications projecting over both lung fields
 are consistent with pleural plaques which appears progressed as compared to
 the prior study.  Lateral left mid to lower hemithorax opacity most likely may
 relate to calcified pleural plaques on the frontal view.  However, on the
 lateral view, the costophrenic angles are sharp and no definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is severe compression of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body also seen increased since ___, ___ as well as
 slightly increased from CT from ___.  The cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Additional compression
 deformities in the upper lumbar spine are not well evaluated on this study. 
 There is apparent prominence of the interstitial markings.  This may in part
 relate to the overlying calcified pleural plaques, however, may be chronic as
 noted on prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive bilateral calcified pleural plaques suggest prior asbestos
 exposure.  
 2.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
 3.  Marked compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body appears increased
 since ___.
