 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Heart failure, crackles, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of the upper and middle zones of the lungs.  In the lower zones,
 there is still a combination of atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions,
 which, however, has not dramatically changed since yesterday.
 
 In the interval, Swan-Ganz catheter and nasogastric tube have been removed.
