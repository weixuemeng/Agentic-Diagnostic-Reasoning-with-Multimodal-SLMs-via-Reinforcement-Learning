                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___ P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with toxic reaction and a high white count. 
 Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary decompensation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are low in volume but clear.  Heart is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch is wide.  This could be due to a
 tortuous or dilated aorta, and there may be some contribution of vascular
 engorgement and mediastinal fat but on conventional radiographs, I cannot
 exclude adenopathy.  Followup advised, with chest radiographs performed with
 the patient sitting as erect as possible.
