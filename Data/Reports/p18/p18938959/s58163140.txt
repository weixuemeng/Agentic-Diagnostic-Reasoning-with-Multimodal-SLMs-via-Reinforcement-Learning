                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lung cancer, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___. ___ CT
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity is noted.  A left bronchial stent is in place.  Rounded
 opacity in right upper lobe is unchanged. Other previously noted solid and
 ground glass nodules in the lungs are better visualized on the prior CT. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged, with similar widening
 compatible with lymphadenopathy. Known left hilar mass is better visualized on
 prior CT.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity, possibly related to atelectasis or
 infection. 
 2.  Unchanged left hilar mass, nodular opacity in the right lower lobe, and
 mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, all of which are better seen on
 the prior CT.
