                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement, now repositioned.  Followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube has been
 slightly pulled back.  The tip now projects 3 cm above the carina.  The left
 bronchial stent is in unchanged position.  Unchanged right subclavian vein
 catheter.  Unchanged nasogastric tube.  Unchanged near complete left lower
 lobe atelectasis, the abnormal contour seen on the previous radiograph,
 located along the left heart border, is now barely visible.  The presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Unchanged appearance of the
 right lung.
