                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new right subclavian line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of the same day
 at 12:46 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right subclavian central line terminates in the low SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.0 cm above the carina.  Left hilar mass appears
 more conspicuous than on the prior study, which may be related to technique or
 position.  Otherwise, no relevant change since the study one hour prior.
