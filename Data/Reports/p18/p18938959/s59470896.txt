                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.   Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The heart is normal size. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity is compatible with known left hilar mass and
 left lower lobe collapse.  Left main stem bronchus stent is in similar
 position to prior.  The right lung is grossly clear, with known nodules better
 appreciated on CT.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, which correlates to known left lower lobe
 collapse and perihilar mass better seen on prior chest CT.  Superimposed
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
