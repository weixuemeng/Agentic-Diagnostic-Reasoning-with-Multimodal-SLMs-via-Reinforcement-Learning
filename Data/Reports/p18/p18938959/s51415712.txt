                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy and
 left mainstem narrowing, status post stenting.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___, selected CT
 images of the chest dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film on ___ at 12:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Since the ___ plain film study, there has been widening of the
 mediastinum and increasing fullness in the hilar vicinity which likely
 correlates to the known mediastinal lymphadenopathy/mass.  A stent is seen
 within the left main stem bronchus.  Patchy opacity at the left base and
 scattered streaky opacities in the right lung are seen, some of which may
 correspond to the ground-glass and cavitary lesions seen on the recent chest
 CT of ___.  No large pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac size is stable.
