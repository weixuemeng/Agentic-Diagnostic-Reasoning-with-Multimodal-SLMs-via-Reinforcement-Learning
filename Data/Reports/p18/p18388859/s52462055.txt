 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, left subclavian central line, right
 internal jugular central line and left basilar chest tube are unchanged in
 position.  There are persistent low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac consolidation
 is again seen, possibly representing partial left lower lobe atelectasis or
 collapse in the setting of a probable layering left effusion.  Heart remains
 stably enlarged.  There is increasing patchy opacity at the right medial lung
 base which may reflect worsening atelectasis or possibly aspiration or
 superimposed pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.No pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
