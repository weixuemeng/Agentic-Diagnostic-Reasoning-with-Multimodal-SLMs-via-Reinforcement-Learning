                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post liver transplant post-bronchoscopy and ___. 
 Assess endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed 6 hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is still deviated towards the left.  ET tube is
 in standard position.  Left subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  NG
 tube tip is out of view, below the diaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 right lung is clear.  There are low lung volumes.  Left mid lung opacities
 have improved.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity, consistent with
 almost collapse of the left lower lobe.
