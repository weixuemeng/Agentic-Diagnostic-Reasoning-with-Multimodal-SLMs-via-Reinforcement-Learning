                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  Endotracheal tube terminates fairly
 close to the carina, within about 1.5 cm and it may be appropriate to retract
 the tube by about 1.5 cm.  Right internal jugular and left subclavian venous
 catheters are present.  Bilateral abdominal drains are still present as well. 
 The left lung base remains similarly opacified, with volume loass and
 including suggestion of a layering pleural effusion.  The retrocardiac area is
 typical for atelectasis of the left lower lobe although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded at this site.  There has been no definite change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low-lying endotracheal tube; retraction by 1-2 cm may be
 appropriate.  Similar opacification of the left lung base with pleural
 effusion.
