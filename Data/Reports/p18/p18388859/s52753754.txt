                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Postoperative pulmonary edema, status post liver transplant,
 evaluation for the course of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, potentially caused by increased ventilatory pressures.  Signs of
 moderate pulmonary edema still present, but have overall slightly decreased as
 compared to the previous image.  The monitoring and support devices, including
 the Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position.  Moderate cardiomegaly with
 relatively extensive retrocardiac and right basal atelectasis persist. 
 Minimal left pleural effusion is likely.
