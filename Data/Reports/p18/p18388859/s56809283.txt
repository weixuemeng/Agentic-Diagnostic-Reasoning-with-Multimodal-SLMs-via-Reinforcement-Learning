                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is

 that has been present for at least one week but is exaggerated by rotation on
 several studies.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
