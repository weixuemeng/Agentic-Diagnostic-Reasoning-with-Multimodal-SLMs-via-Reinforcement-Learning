                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain, new atrial fibrillation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are low.
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  Known osseous lesions are better assessed on the previous CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis. Known osseous lesions are better assessed on
 the previous CT exam.
