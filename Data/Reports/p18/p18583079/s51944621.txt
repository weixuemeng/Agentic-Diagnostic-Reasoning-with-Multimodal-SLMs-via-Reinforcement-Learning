                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The heart is
 at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is similar moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm with streaky right basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis
 or scarring.  However, otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Small anterior osteophytes are present
 throughout the thoracic spine with similar mild loss among mid thoracic
 vertebral body heights.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
