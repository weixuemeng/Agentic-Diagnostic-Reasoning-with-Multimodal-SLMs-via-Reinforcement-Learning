                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p CABG  // f/u effusions, atx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There are bilateral small pleural effusions with
 associated atelectasis.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Even
 allowing for the projection, the heart is enlarged.  There is prominence of
 pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion but
 no frank pulmonary edema.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar in degree when compared to the
 prior study.
