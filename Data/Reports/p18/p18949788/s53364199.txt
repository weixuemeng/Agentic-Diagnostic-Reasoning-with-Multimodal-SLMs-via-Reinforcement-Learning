                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with months of cough  // ?pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are low and there
 is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is a vague ground-glass
 opacity in the right lung apex which is indeterminate, possibly representing
 scarring though in the absence of prior imaging, a nonemergent CT of the chest
 may be obtained to further assess.  There is mild perihilar reticulation in
 the left lung.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears upper limits of normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings as above.  Consider nonemergent chest CT to further assess.
