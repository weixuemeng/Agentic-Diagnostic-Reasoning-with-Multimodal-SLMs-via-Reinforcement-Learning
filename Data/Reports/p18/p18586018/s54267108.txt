  There has been interval development of a retrocardiac opacity which is likely
  due to atelectasis, however a superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The
  cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There are likely small bilateral
  pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The right IJ approach central
  venous catheter appears to terminate within the proximal right atrium. If
  positioning within the cavoatrial junction is desired it may be pulled back by
  2 to 3 cm.
