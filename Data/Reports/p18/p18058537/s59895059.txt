                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube placement  // eval chest tube
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 07:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior study, a left-sided chest tube has been placed, with tip at
 the left lung apex.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified, though a thin
 curvilinear lucency at the extreme apex of the left lung could represent
 either lucency from normal lung adjacent to rib or a extremely tiny
 pneumothorax. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest near
 the diaphragm is noted.
 
 
 Hazy opacity at the right lung base is new, likely a combination of a small
 effusion and underlying atelectasis.
 
 Patchy opacity at the left lung base is new and may also represent atelectasis
 or changes related to the ED chest tube.  No gross left effusion.  Upper zone
 redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 Fusion construct at the thoracolumbar spine is new, grossly unremarkable on
 this limited assessment.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left chest tube.  Doubt pneumothorax, but attention to
 tiny curvilinear lucency at the left lung apex is recommended.  This most
 likely represents ___ artifact of long adjacent to bone.
 
 New hazy opacity at the right lung base could represent a small effusion with
 atelectasis.  No frank consolidation identified.
 
 Minimal opacity at the left lung is also noted, likely atelectasis, though an
 early infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No gross left effusion.
 
 New fusion hardware seen at the thoracolumbar junction.
