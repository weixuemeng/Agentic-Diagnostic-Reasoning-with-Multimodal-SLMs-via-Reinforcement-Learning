                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/pulmonary contusions, please eval for interval change  //
 ___M w/pulmonary contusions, please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved. 
 Subtle upper lung predominant opacities have improved in the interval and may
 be related to history of contusions.  Bilateral retrocardiac opacities have
 worsened and probably reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
