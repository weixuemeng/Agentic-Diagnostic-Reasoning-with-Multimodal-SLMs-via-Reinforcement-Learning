                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p redo sternotomy for resection mediastinal
 carcinoma.  // PLease eval for interval change from prior; formal films
 post-chest tube removal.

 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  A midline air-fluid level is newly appreciated in the
 retrosternal region and may reflect postoperative changes in the mediastinum
 in this patient status post recent resection of a mediastinal mass.  Within
 the lungs, note is made of bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left, and
 new small bilateral pleural effusions.
