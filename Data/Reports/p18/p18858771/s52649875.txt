 AP CHEST, 6:12 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, wheezing.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:26 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes have improved, but there is new heterogeneous opacification at
 the base of the right lung which suggests recent aspiration.  Heart is mildly
 to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests elevated
 central venous pressure or volume, but pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable
 and there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 845, one minute following recognition of the
 findings.
