                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again some patchy
 opacification at the left base.  Although this could merely reflect
 atelectasis, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of aspiration

 Remainder of the study is unchanged.
