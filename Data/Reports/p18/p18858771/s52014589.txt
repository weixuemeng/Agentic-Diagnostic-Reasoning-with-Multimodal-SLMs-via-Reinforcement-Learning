                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Wheezing on exam and prior chest radiograph suggesting a left
 lower lobe process.  Evaluate for any consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Heterogeneous opacities in the left lower lobe are slightly decreased compared
 to the prior study from ___, possibly related to atelectasis,
 although infection could have an identical appearance.  Previously noted
 heterogeneous right lower lung opacities have resolved.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are not significantly changed.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are likely present, although were not seen on CT from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight improvement in left lower lung heterogeneous opacities, possible
 atelectasis, although infection could be present in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 2.  Resolution of heterogeneous right lower lung opacities seen on the
 radiograph from ___, likely secondary to improved atelectasis.
 
 3.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
