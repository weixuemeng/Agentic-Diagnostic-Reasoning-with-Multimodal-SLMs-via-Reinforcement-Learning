 is stable.  There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Prominence of
 the central pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary edema.  There is also
 patchy left base retrocardiac opacity into superimposed consolidation due to
 infection and/ or aspiration not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen
 but trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.
