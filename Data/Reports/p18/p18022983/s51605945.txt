 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:00 AM
  Comminuted sternal fracture, multiple bilateral rib fractures, and trace
  bilateral basilar pneumothoraces are better assessed on CT of the chest
  performed concurrently.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 1:55 AM
  No acute displaced rib fracture identified.  If concern remains for rib
  fracture, recommend dedicated rib films with a BB marker placed over the
  location of pain.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pain after mvc // R sided chest pain after mvc
 s/p rib removed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___,
 and CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Atelectatic
 changes at the bilateral bases are presumed to be secondary to hypoventilation
 in the setting of splinting.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion or consolidation.  Partially imaged spinal
 fusion hardware appears intact.  Comminuted sternal fracture, multiple
 bilateral rib fractures, and trace bilateral basilar pneumothoraces are better
 assessed on CT of the chest performed concurrently.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comminuted sternal fracture, multiple bilateral rib fractures, and trace
 bilateral basilar pneumothoraces are better assessed on CT of the chest
 performed concurrently.
