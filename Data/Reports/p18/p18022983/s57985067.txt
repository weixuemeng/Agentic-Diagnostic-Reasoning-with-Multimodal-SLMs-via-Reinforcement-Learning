                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post MVC with sternal fracture,
 retrosternal hematoma, and multiple bilateral rib fractures.  Assess interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ at 02:59 CT
 chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal and the hilar contours are within normal limits.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Previously noted
 bilateral rib fractures, some of which are acute, are better assessed on the
 recent CT.  Displaced healed and acute sternal fractures are also noted,
 similar compared to the previous exams.  Partially imaged is fusion hardware
 within the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No interval change from the previous exams.  Bibasilar atelectasis with low
 lung volumes.  Re- demonstration of sternal fractures.  Known bilateral rib
 fractures are better assessed on previous CT.
