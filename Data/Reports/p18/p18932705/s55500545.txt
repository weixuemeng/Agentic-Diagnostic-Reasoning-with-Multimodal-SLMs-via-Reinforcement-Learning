                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, chest pain, emphysema.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax, rib fracture,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest with contrast ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unchanged cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis. 
 There are post radiation changes in the right hilum.
 
 Again seen is a large right upper lobe mass.  Again seen is a small calcified
 granuloma in the right middle lobe.  There is a background of emphysema.
 
 There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, likely representing a small
 pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
 
 Again seen are multilevel degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax or rib fracture, as clinically questioned.  Please
 note that chest radiographs are relatively insensitive for identifying rib
 fractures.
 
 No significant change in a large right upper lobe mass, consistent with
 patient's history of non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may represent a small pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening
