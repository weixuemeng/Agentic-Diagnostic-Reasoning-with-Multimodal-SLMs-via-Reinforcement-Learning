  small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal consolidation.
  2. Unchanged right upper lung mass consistent with known non-small-cell lung
  cancer.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally and increased caliber of the
 central pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild associated interstitial edema.  The right upper lobe mass
 consistent with patient's known non-small-cell lung cancer is unchanged. 
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusions are
 present bilaterally.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is
 unchanged calcification of the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with associated interstitial edema and
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation.
 2. Unchanged right upper lung mass consistent with known non-small-cell lung
 cancer.
