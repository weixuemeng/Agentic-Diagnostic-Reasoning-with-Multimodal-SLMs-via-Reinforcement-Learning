 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.  Assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are suggested on the lateral with a right lower lobe opacity
 which could reflect atelectasis; however infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with diffuse calcification
 of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe opacity which could
 reflect atelectasis or infectious process.
