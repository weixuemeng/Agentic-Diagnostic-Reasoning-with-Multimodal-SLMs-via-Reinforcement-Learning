                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating cardiac silhouette and causing
 crowding of the bronchopulmonary vasculature.  Heart size is normal with mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  There is engorgement of the central
 pulmonary vasculature with increased interstitial lung markings compatible
 with moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no clear focal consolidation
 suggestive of pneumonia.  Pleural surfaces are clear without large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with central pulmonary vascular congestion and
 moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  The degree of edema appears worse than
 on subsequent CT evaluation suggestive some degree of improvement between the
 two exams.
