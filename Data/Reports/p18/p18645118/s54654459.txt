                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aphasia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated which limits assessment.  Heart size is likely mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the degree of
 rotation.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Lung volumes are low, and streaky
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is
 clearly evident.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to patient rotation.  Probable mild bibasilar atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.
