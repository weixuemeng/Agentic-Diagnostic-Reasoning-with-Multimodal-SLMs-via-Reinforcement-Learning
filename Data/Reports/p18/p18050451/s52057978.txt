                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right upper lobe lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,
 ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a persistent right apical pleural space that is mostly
 fluid-filled with a small amount of air, as well as a loculated, lateral,
 costal fluid collection. Rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged in the
 postoperative period.   The right hilus and adjacent mediastinum are still
 bulbous and enlarged, likely caused by hematoma or other fluid collection,
 edema in a bronchial stump augmentation or right middle lobe collapse.  It is
 unclear whether this enlargement and shift of the mediastinum is clinically
 significant.  A CT could be obtained if clinically concerning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right apical pleural space, mostly fluid-filled with
 some air, and costal pleural fluid loculation.
 
 Right hilar and mediastinal enlargement hematoma, fluid collection, edema of
 stump augmentation, or right middle lobe collaps.  Consider CT if clinically
 indicated.
