                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right upper lobe
 lobectomy, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The postoperative apical density
 interpreted as postoperative loculated pneumothorax now filled in with pleural
 scar appears grossly unchanged.  No remaining cavity with fluid level can be
 seen.  The previously identified marked prominence of the right hilar area
 persists.  It is now noted that a parenchymal density in the lateral area of
 the right upper lobe has become more prominent and coincides with the local
 pleural density that has developed along the lateral axillary chest wall. 
 Comparison of the lateral views confirms this suspicion as the posteriorly
 oriented density overlying the superior vertebral bodies has clearly
 increased.  Right-sided pleural densities are unchanged without development of
 new free fluid.  The left hemithorax remains unchanged and normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Follow up with two weeks examination interval indicates scar
 formations in apical area, persistent unchanged prominence of hilar changes,
 but now occurrence of increasing parenchymal density occupying the lateral
 posterior area, coinciding with local pleural density.  The latter finding is
 worrisome as it is not compatible with normal regression of postoperative
 changes.  Referring physician, ___ was paged at 3:40 p.m. so to transmit
 expressed concerns.
