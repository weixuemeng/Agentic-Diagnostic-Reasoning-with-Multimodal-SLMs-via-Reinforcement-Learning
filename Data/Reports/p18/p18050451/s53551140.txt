                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right upper lobectomy.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinum superiorly is deviated towards the
 right, unchanged from prior.  Small right apical amount of air in the pleural
 space is unchanged.  Right upper opacity is most likely fluid in the pleural
 space.  It has increased from prior study.  There is probably atelectasis in
 the right middle lobe.  Postsurgical changes in the right hilum are again
 noted and unchanged.  Surgical clips are also seen in the right lower
 hemithorax.  Right subcutaneous emphysema is minimal.  Small left pleural
 effusion has decreased.  Atelectasis in the left lower lobe has improved.
