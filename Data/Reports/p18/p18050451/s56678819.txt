                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post resection of right upper lobe
 mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a right-sided IJ
 central catheter in place with the tip apparently in adequate position in the
 SVC, provided there is adequate draw back clinically.  There is no
 pneumothorax or other complication seen.  Atelectasis is seen at the left lung
 base.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is substantial right perihilar
 post-surgical changes which makes differentiating mediastinal tissues
 difficult.  The heart appears to be of normal size.  Subcutaneous gas is
 visualized along the right side of the body up to the neck.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right IJ in adequate position in the SVC, provided there is
 adequate draw back clinically.
 
 These findings were communicated to the patient's clinical team by phone at
 3:50 p.m.
