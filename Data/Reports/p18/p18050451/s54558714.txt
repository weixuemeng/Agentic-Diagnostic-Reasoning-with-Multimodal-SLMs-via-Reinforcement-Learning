                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right upper lobectomy,
 check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar chest
 examinations of ___ and ___.  Size and appearance
 of thoracic aorta unchanged.  The previously described right-sided apical
 pleural density remains unaltered.  The on next previous examination suspected
 remaining parenchymal densities and pleural thickening in the axillary area
 has regressed in size, appears to blend the apical pleural scar formations. 
 Post-operative appearance of progressive right-sided hilar stump has not
 increased in prominence.  No new parenchymal infiltrates in the remaining
 right-sided lung tissue which demonstrates a basal pleural scar formation at
 the diaphragmatic surface and no new parenchymal infiltrates or masses.  Left
 hemithorax remains unchanged and within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The presently identified latest interval changes are compatible
 with increased pleural scar formations.  Thus, there is no conclusive evidence
 for reoccurrence of pulmonary malignancy.  Considering the rather large
 pleural scar formations, further followup with monthly intervals is
 recommended.
