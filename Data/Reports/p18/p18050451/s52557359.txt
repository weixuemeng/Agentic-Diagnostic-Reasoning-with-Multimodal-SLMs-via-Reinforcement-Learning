 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe mass and mediastinal adenopathy, status post
 bronchoscopy, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a known right upper lobe mass with subsequent extensive
 parenchymal opacity.  Loss of the paratracheal stripe suggests a mediastinal
 adenopathy.  On the current image, there is no convincing evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 Loss of structure in the left upper lobe suggests pulmonary emphysema. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusions.  Moderate
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
