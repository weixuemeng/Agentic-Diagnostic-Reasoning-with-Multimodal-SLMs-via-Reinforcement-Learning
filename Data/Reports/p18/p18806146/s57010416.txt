 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia before VQ scanning.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to

 Cardiomegaly is noted. Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are overall essentially
 clear except for left basal opacity that appears to be minimally progressed
 since the prior study.  Minimal pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
