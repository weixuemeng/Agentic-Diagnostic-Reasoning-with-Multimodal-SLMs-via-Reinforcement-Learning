 // ___F w/head injury s/p intubation, please eval for interval change      ___F
 w/head injury s/p intubation, please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  Other monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacification again most likely reflects
 atelectatic changes, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 aspiration could be considered.  Left hemidiaphragm now quite sharply seen. 
 No evidence of appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion.
