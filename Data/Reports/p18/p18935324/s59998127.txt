 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube has been removed.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Left
 lower lobe collapse has developed in the interval with small left pleural
 effusion.  Minimal atelectasis is noted in the right lower lobe.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple vertebral bodies within the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine again demonstrate prominent Schmorl nodes and mild loss of
 vertebral height.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.

 Left lower lobe collapse and small left pleural effusion.  Coexisting
 infection in the left lower lobe is not excluded.
