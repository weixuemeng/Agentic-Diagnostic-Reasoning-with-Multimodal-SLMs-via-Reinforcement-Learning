                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, syncope, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits, with a
 mildly tortuous thoracic aorta.  Mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette
 likely relates to low lung volumes and AP technique.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
