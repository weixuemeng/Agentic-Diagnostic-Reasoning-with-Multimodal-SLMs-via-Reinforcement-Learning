 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with adrenal crisis, left upper back pain  //
 eval for pneumonia, rib fractures      eval for pneumonia, rib fractures
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New heterogeneous opacification left lung base could be early pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Right lung clear.  No definite pleural abnormality, but lateral
 radiograph would be helpful in assessing possible pleural effusion as well as
 the integrity of the thoracic spine.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
