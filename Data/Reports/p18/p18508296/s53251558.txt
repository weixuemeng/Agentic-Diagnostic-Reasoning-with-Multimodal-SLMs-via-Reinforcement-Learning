                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacities in both lower lungs have decreased
 substantially leaving only streaky lingular opacities suggesting minor
 atelectasis in the lingula and along the right infrahilar zone. Elsewhere the
 lungs remain clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved areas of probable atelectasis.
