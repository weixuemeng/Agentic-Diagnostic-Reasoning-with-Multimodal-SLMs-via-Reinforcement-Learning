                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right-sided pneumothorax, assess for
 resolution.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded and clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or residual pneumothorax.  Mild right-sided
 apical pleural thickening is likely a sequela of the traumatic event.  The
 heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No residual pneumothorax.
