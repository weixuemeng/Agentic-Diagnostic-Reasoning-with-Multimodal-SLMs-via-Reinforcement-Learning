 HISTORY:  Chest tube removed, check for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right apical pneumothorax, larger than on the
 prior exam.  There is increased opacity in the right middle lobe that may
 represent volume loss or early infiltrate.  A moderate amount of subcutaneous
 emphysema is again seen in the right lateral chest wall and axillary region. 
 The left lung is clear.
