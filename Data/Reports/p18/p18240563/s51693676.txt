 atelactasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph

 Right-sided central venous line again terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  Since the prior radiograph there is a
 new heterogeneous airspace opacity in the left mid and lower lung.  Elevation
 of left hemidiaphragm indicates that a portion of this opacification may
 represent atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 Left mid and lower lung airspace opacification represent pneumonia.
