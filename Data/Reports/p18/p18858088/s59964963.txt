                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall, unresponsive.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications at the
 aortic knob again demonstrated.  Mild upper zone vascular re-distribution is
 presumably due to supine positioning.  The opacification over the left mid and
 lower lung fields appear well marginated, and could be due to overlying soft
 tissue structures.  No other focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged
 thoracolumbar spine.  Degenerative changes are also noted within both
 shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy opacification over the left mid and lower lung fields are
 presumably due to overlying soft tissue.  This could be further assessed with
 a dedicated PA and lateral view of the chest.
