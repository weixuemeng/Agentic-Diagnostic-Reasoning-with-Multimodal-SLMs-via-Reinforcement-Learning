                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  On the lateral view, at the right lung
 base posteriorly, there is a vague opacity that may represent pneumonia.  This
 is not entirely well seen on the frontal view.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity posteriorly in the right lower lobe may represent
 pneumonia.  Steep oblique views can be done for more definitive assessment.
