                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with chest pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Small 1 cm round
 opacity projecting in the right infrahilar region more likely represents
 superimposed vascular and bony structures rather than a pulmonary nodule. 
 Follow up imaging should be considered.  The heart is normal in size. No acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal pneumonia.  Right lower medial nodular opacity is felt to more likely
 represent vascular confluence rather than parenchymal mass.  Followup imaging
 should be considered.
