                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man p/w fever, back and abdominal pain, found to have
 MSSA bactermia without a source, and with trace bilateral pleural effusions
 and nonspecific ground-glass opacities at the lung bases (potentially of
 infectious or inflammatory etiology) on abdominal CT  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  On the current image, there is no
 evidence of pleural effusion, and the parenchymal opacities described and seen
 on the abdominal CT examination from ___ are not visualized. The
 morphology and distribution of these opacities, however, strongly suggests an
 aspiration-related cause.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. There is no pulmonary
 edema. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.
