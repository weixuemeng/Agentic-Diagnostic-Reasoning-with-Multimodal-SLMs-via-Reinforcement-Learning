                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and delirium, question interval
 change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 7:18.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 2:17 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in position.  Lung volumes
 remain relatively low and there is decreased aeration at the right base which
 may reflect an enlarging right pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  Persistent consolidation at the left
 base with an associated effusion is also identified.  There continues to be
 mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the bilateral
 airspace process.
