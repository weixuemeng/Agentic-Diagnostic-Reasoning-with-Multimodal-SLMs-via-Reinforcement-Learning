                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female intubated with pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is seen with tip
 approximately 3.8 cm from the carina.  There is hazy opacity projecting over
 the right hemithorax suggesting layering effusion.  Detailed evaluation of the
 parenchyma is limited due to motion however there is suggestion of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  No definite acute
 osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Probable pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Increased opacity in the right hemithorax likely due to layering
 effusion with superimposed infection is also possible.
