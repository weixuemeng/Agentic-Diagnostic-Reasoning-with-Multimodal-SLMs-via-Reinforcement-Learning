                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation required for MRI.  Evaluation of ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the endotracheal tube
 terminating 5.7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube sidehole terminates
 above the diaphragm though tip is within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low,
 and there is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Partially imaged
 is fusion hardware within the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in standard position. Nasogastric tube sideport
 is in the distal esophagus and the tube should be advanced for optimal
 positioning.
