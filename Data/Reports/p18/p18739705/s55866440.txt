                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Primary omental cancer with extensive intra-abdominal metastases
 and a right pleural effusion.  Status post pleurocentesis.  Evaluate for
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with the tip in
 the lower SVC.  Again, there is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion,
 slightly increased when compared to the prior exam.  There is associated
 compressive right basilar atelectasis.  There is minimal left basilar
 atelectasis.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Low lungs volumes are
 accentuating the bronchovascular structures, though there is no evidence of
 pneumonia or overt edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in the size of the moderate right
 pleural effusion.
