 HISTORY:  Dyspnea with decreased breath sounds on the right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  There has been
 substantial interval enlargement of the right pleural effusion which is now
 large with associated right basilar atelectasis.  Left lung is grossly clear. 
 There may be a trace left pleural effusion.  Heart size is difficult to assess
 given the presence of the large right pleural effusion.  Mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Substantial interval increase in size of the right pleural effusion, now
 large, with right basilar atelectasis.
