  Endotracheal tube terminates 9 cm cranial to the ___ at the level of the
  thoracic inlet and should be advanced. Right IJ Port-A-Cath terminates at the
  cavoatrial junction. NG tube terminates in the proximal stomach with side port
  at the GE junction. This is acceptable as this tube is being used for
  decompression only per primary team. No evidence for pleural effusion or
  aspiration. Scattered chronic appearing changes are similar to ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 9 cm above the carina and could
 be advanced approximately 4 to 5 centimeters for standard positioning.  Tip of
 nasogastric tube terminates in proximal stomach with side port above GE
 junction and could also be advanced.  
 
 Exam is otherwise remarkable for a large mass-like area of opacification above
 the right hilum with adjacent surgical sutures, as well as right upper lobe
 volume loss and asymmetrical right apical thickening.  Although similar to
 recent radiographs, this is a change from baseline radiograph of ___.  Surgical sutures are also present in the left mid lung.
 
 Further evaluation with dedicated chest CT is suggested when the patient's
 clinical status permits, in order to assess for possible lung malignancy.  Dr.
 ___ was successfully paged to discuss these findings at 8:15 a.m. on
 ___ at time of discovery.
