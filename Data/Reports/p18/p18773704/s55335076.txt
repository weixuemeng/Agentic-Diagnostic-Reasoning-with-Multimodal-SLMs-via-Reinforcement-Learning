 The lungs are well expanded.  There is a mass in the right upper lobe,
 partially imaged on recent MR and similar to recent prior radiographs but new

 definite focal consolidation is seen, however cannot exclude a small opacity
 in the posterior lungs, which could be obscured by the pleural effusions.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 
 A compression deformity is noted in an upper thoracic vertebra.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No definite focal consolidation, however cannot exclude a small opacity in
