                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pulmonary hypertension, 1 week shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous but unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is
 demonstrated.  No new focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Chronic small right pleural effusion which is
 loculated along the basolateral aspect of the right hemithorax is similar, as
 is bi-apical thickening, more pronounced on the right.  Post surgical changes
 are seen involving the right AC joint with a high riding humerus suggestive of
 underlying rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No interval change from the previous exam.  No new areas of focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia, and no evidence of pulmonary edema.
