                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are low in volume
 but clear.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm has increased. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in
 the mid SVC.  The heart is not well assessed due to low lung volumes but
 cardiomediastinal contours appear unremarkable.  Ovoid corticated radiodensity
 projecting in the vicinity of the left shoulder could reflect an
 intra-articular body.  Degenerative cervical spine changes are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, possibly due to
 increasing abdominal ascites. No acute intrathoracic process.
