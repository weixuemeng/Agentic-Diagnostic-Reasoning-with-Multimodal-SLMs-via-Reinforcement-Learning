                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 minimal prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  This may be due to minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal left base atelectasis is seen.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
