                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with prior subcutaneous emphysema and
 pathologic rib fractures, who presents for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is the peripheral right upper lung mass as well as large
 right lower lung opacity. The right lower lung opacity appears to demonstrate
 a loculated with an air fluid level, consistent with the prior CT. There has
 been interval resolution of the subcutaneous emphysema.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.  The heart size is normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again seen are pathologic rib
 fractures on the right, better assessed on the prior CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
  
 1. The right lower lung opacity has changed in morphology, now demonstrating a
 loculated cavity with an air-fluid level. 
 
 2. There has been interval resolution of the subcutaneous gas. 
 
 3. The pathologic rib fractures seen on the prior CT are difficult to
 appreciate and compare on this exam. 
 
 4. The right upper lung mass is also better characterized on the prior CT,
 although it is slightly more apparent on this exam compared to the radiograph
 from ___.
