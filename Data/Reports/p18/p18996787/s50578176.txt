                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe cavity, status post bronchoscopy and biopsy. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A peripheral right upper lung mass and a large right lower lung
 cavitary mass are better assessed on recent CT from ___.  There is
 subsegmental left lower lung atelectasis.  There is minimal right lower lung
 atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild right lateral
 chest wall subcutaneous air was seen on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Large right lower lobe cavitary mass, better evaluated on prior CT. 
 Similarly, subpleural right upper lobe mass is also better evaluated on recent
 cross-sectional imaging.
 
 3.  Persistent right lateral chest wall subcutaneous air.
