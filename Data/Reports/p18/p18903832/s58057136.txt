 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, R lung rhonchi  // eval for
 pneumonia      eval for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  There has been development of opacification at the
 left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms. Although this could
 merely represent pleural effusion and atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical
 setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.
