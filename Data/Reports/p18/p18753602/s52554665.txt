                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with leukocytosis and fatigue  // eval pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged, increased in size compared to the prior
 exam. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Numerous clips are demonstrated within the
 right hilar region compatible with prior right lung lobectomy.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Consolidative opacity is noted within the
 right lung base, most pronounced within the peripheral aspect of the right mid
 lung field.  Small right pleural effusion is present. Scarring within the lung
 apices is re- demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified. Extensive degenerative changes of the right shoulder
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Consolidative opacity in the right lung base with small right pleural
 effusion may reflect an area of infection. Given the prior history of
 malignancy, neoplasm is not excluded. Recommend followup radiographs to
 resolution after treatment, and/or chest CT.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
