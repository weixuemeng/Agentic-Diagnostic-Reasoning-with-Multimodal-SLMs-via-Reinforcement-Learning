  Consolidative opacities centrally in the mid right lung appears slightly
  better with slight interval improvement in aeration compared to the prior
  exam, however this may be secondary to patient rotation and acquisition
  technique. Small loculated right pleural effusion is unchanged compared to the
  prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
  persistent, with mild pulmonary edema.
