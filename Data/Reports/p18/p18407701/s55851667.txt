                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough.  Recently treated for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is subtle patchy opacity projecting over the spine on the
 lateral view, likely localizing to the left based on the frontal view.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear and there is no effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Deformity of the posterior left and
 probable right ribs is seen compatible with prior healed fractures. 
 Compression deformities also seen in the upper to mid thoracic spine with
 associated kyphosis. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left basilar opacity which may represent pneumonia. 
 Bilateral posterior rib deformities which appear old and wedge deformities of
 the mid thoracic spine, of uncertain age and clinical correlation is
 suggested.
