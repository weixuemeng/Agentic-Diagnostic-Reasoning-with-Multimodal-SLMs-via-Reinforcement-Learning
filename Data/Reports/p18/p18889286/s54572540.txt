 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are within normal limits and unchanged compared to the prior
 study.  There are persistent bibasilar opacities with ring shadows consistent
 with bronchiectasis.  Appearances are consistent with the patient's known
 pulmonary fibrosis.  Difficult to exclude superimposed infection however the
 the appearances are grossly similar when compared to the prior study.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  The visualized bony structures are
 unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar opacities consistent with the patient's known pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Difficult to exclude superimposed infection however no convincing
 evidence of superimposed infection on the current study.
