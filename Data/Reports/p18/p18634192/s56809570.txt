                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right ptx s/p chest tube  // daily XR chest
 tube (___ am please)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there has been marked decrease in the size of the
 right sided pneumothorax.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax remains visible. 
 The pigtail catheter overlies the right mid lung laterally.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema is again noted overlying the right chest.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again seen is mild bilateral
 prominence of the pulmonary hila with a tapered appearance.  Mild upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora similar to the prior film.  Hazy
 densities project over both lungs, but given CT from 18:00 last night, likely
 represent predominately artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity in the lingula and left lung base and in the right
 cardiophrenic region are similar to the prior film.  No gross effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Marked improvement in the right-sided pneumothorax, with a tiny residual
 right apical pneumothorax present.
 2. Mild upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora again noted, similar
 in degree.
 3. Patchy opacities at the left  base could represent there is a focal
 infiltrate and/or aspiration.  Changes at the right base are non-specific, but
 more suggestive of atelectasis.
