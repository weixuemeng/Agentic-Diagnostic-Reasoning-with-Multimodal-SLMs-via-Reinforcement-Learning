                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right ptx s/p chest tube placement  // f/u
 chest tube for ptx, clamped **please do ___**
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 08:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, there is now a small to moderate-sized
 right upper lobe pneumothorax, new or significantly larger than on the prior
 film.  The right pigtail catheter is again seen, similar in position, allowing
 for slight rotation.  There is relatively minimal atelectasis at the right
 lung base.  There is subcutaneous emphysema over the right chest, which
 appears more pronounced on the prior study.  There is minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, which is elevated new or slightly more pronounced.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged and remains midline.
 
 Hazy opacity over the left mid and lower zones is seen, but may represent
 artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  There is subsegmental atelectasis at
 the left lung base.  Allowing for this, no CHF, focal consolidation or gross
 effusion is seen in the left lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New versus significantly larger small to moderate right upper lobe
 pneumothorax, with only minimal right lung atelectasis.  Right pigtail
 catheter is minimally rotated, but overall similar in configuration.
 2. New or more pronounced right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.
 3. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis left base.
 4. Hazy opacity over left mid and lower zones laterally more likely represents
 artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  However, attention to this area on
 followup films is requested to exclude a focal opacity.
 
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Review of ___:45 OMR note indicates that failure of
 clamping trial is known.
