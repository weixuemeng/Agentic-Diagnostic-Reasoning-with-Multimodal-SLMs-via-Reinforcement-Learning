                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCC, cirrhosis, increased fluid retention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Opacification within the left lung base near the
 left costophrenic angle on the frontal view suggests a small left pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  The right lung is grossly clear.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacification likely reflects atelectasis with small left pleural
 effusion though infection cannot be excluded.
