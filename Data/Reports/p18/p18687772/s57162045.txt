  Aspiration vs bibasilar bronchopneumonia.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in
 the aortic knob.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are subtly increased
 likely bibasilar peribronchovascular opacities most notable on lateral view
 which could represent either aspiration or bronchopneumonia.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtly increased peribronchovascular opacities, possibly
 bibasilar but definitely on the left, best seen on lateral view which could
 represent either aspiration or bronchopneumonia.
