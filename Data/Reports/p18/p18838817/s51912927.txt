                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of worsening mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of the previously seen left PICC.  Relative left
 retrocardiac opacity may relate to atelectasis, although an early
 consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The
 right lung is clear.  There are low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable,
 with calcified tortuous aorta again seen and the cardiac silhouette not
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base retrocardiac opacity could relate to atelectasis,
 although consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
