 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of HIV on HAART. End-stage renal disease status post
 renal transplant on immunosuppressive presenting with altered mental status
 and fall. Assess for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mildly hypoinflated lungs

 lower lobe atelectasis is noted. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Persistent moderate cardiomegaly noted. Mediastinal contour, and hila are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 Free intraperitoneal air is likely present on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mildly hypoinflated lungs with mild vascular congestion.
 2.  No pneumonia.
 3.  Free intraperitoneal air may be related to patient's intraperitoneal
 dialysis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Free intraperitoneal air may be related to patient's
 intraperitoneal dialysis. Clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
