                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and chills, to assess for abscess.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some ill-defined
 area of opacification at the right base and posteriorly.  In view of the
 clinical history, this could well represent a right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Prominence of interstitial
 markings could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, chronic
 lung disease, or both.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right lower lobe consolidation.
