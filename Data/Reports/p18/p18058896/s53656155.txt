                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis and chills.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate mildly tortuous aorta with calcified atherosclerotic disease at
 the aortic knob.  The lungs demonstrate heterogeneous lucency with coarsening
 of the interstitial markings as well as hyperinflation and flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms.  These findings are all compatible with COPD.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without evidence of pneumonia.
