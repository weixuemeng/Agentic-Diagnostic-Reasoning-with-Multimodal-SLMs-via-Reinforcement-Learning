 identified, both of underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  The right PICC
 line tip projects over the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.  A catheter or
 other tubing overlying the upper abdomen is partially imaged; it is unclear if
 this is internal or external to the patient.

 Grossly unchanged large right and smaller left pleural effusions with
 underlying collapse and or consolidation.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  In
