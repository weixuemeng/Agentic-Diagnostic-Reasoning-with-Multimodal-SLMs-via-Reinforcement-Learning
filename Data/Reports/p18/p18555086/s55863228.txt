                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion and weakness  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Thoracic scoliosis is noted knee and the patient is rotated somewhat to the
 left.  There are extremely low lung volumes.  Right mid to lower lung patchy
 opacity are seen which could be due to infection or aspiration along with
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural
 effusion would be difficult to exclude.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Cardiac silhouette is not well assessed
 but may be top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient rotated somewhat to the left and there appears to be some thoracic
 scoliosis.  Lung volumes are very low, limiting evaluation, however, there
 appear to be right mid to lower lung patchy opacities raising concern for
 infection or aspiration along with atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion
 seen, trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.
