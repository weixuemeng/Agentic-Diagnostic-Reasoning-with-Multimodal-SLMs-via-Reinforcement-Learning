                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new pulmonary edema, unclear I/Os,
 persistent O2 requirement  // Interval change in edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient is
 markedly rotated towards right, limiting assessment of cardiomediastinal
 contours and obscuring a portion of the right lung.  With this limitation in
 mind, there has not been a gross interval change since the recent study, but
 repeat radiograph with improved positioning would be helpful for more accurate
 assessment when the patient's condition permits.
