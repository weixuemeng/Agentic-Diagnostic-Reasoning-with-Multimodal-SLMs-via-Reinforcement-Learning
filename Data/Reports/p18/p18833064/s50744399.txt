                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall and syncopal. Evaluate for pneumonia
 or fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There are coarse interstitial markings compatible with
 interstitial pulmonary edema. More confluent opacities are seen in the right
 lower lung and probably in the retrocardiac region. There is a left-sided
 pleural effusion. There is no right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Assessment of cardiac size is limited although there is apparent moderate
 cardiomegaly, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Superimposed
 right lower lobe pneumoniae vs aspiration cannot be completely excluded.
 Correlate clinically.
