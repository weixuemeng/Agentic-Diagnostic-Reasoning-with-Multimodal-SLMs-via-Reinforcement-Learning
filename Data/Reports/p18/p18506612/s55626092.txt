 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is borderline in size with a
 left ventricular configuration.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Particularly on the anterior view, there is a retrocardiac opacity, probably
 referring to the left lower lobe, although not well seen on the lateral view,
 including air bronchograms.  This film is limited, but findings raise concern
 for developing pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs with better
 inspiration may be helpful if needed clinically.
