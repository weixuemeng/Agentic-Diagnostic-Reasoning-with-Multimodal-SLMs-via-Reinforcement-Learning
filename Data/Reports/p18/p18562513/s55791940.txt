                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Postop day #1, status post laparoscopic robotic
 cystoprostatectomy with open ileal loop diversion, now with tachycardia, here
 to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of
 view on this image.  The lungs are underinflated, with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  Streaky opacities in the left lung base greater
 than the right are compatible with atelectasis in this setting.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes and mild
 atelectasis.
