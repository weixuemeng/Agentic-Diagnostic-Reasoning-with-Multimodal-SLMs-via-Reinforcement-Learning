                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with SAH.  Intubated with new onset of fever. 
 Assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates no evidence of
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation, however there is some
 mild interval increase in air bronchograms seen in the right lung base.  This
 study demonstrates unchanged position of the endotracheal tube which ends 2 cm
 above the carina.  The left subclavian line is again seen, ending in the right
 atrium.  If repositioning is clinically indicated, this tube could be pulled
 back approximately 4 cm to end in the low SVC.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Mild interval increase in density of air bronchograms in the
 right lung base which could represent consolidation or atelectasis.  If
 clinical concern exists, a lateral view would be recommended for further
 evaluation.  Otherwise, no significant change since the prior study.
