                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 5:16
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fevers and positive sputum for gram-positive
 rods.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 16:29.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 5:16 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  An endotracheal tube has its tip proximally 2-3 cm above the
 carina, unchanged.  Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect a component of
 atelectasis, but the lungs are otherwise clear.  No pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging with PA and
 lateral views may be helpful.
