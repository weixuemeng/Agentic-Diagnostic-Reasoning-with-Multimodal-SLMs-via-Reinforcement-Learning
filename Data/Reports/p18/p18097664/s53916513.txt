                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yoM with PMHx PTC and now with anaplastic thyroid cancer
 presenting with weakness/shakiness and disorientation x 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Leftward deviation and narrowing of the
 trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet due to a right upper paratracheal
 mass is re- demonstrated, better assessed on the recent CT. Multiple clips are
 again noted within the right neck.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Known metastases within the lungs, the
 largest within the left lower lobe and left upper lobe, are also better
 assessed on the recent CT.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Hypertrophic
 changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Re- demonstration of leftward tracheal deviation and narrowing at the level
 of the thoracic inlet due to known right upper paratracheal mass, better
 assessed on recent CT.
 2. Known pulmonary metastases are better assessed on recent CT.  No new focal
 consolidation identified.
