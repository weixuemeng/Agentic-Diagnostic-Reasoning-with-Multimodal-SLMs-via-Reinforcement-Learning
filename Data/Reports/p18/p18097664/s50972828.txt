                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of pneumonia at___
 ___.  Evaluate for resolution of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___ performed at the___ campus.  
 
 The present PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size appears to be at borderline with a relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour.  This coincides with a moderate
 degree of widening and mild elongation of the thoracic aorta suggestive of
 systemic hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature, however, is not congested.  The
 on next previous examination of ___ identified pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates that occupied the right middle lobe have resolved
 almost completely. There remain some small linear densities in this area
 suggestive of scar formations or peripheral remnants of atelectasis.  No new
 pulmonary abnormalities can be identified.  A linear density in the left upper
 lobe area reaching the apical pleura where local thickening exists appears to
 be evidence of old probably specific scars.  Their appearance has not changed
 during the latest examination interval.  Observed that the previous
 examination was also confirmed by a CT examination at that time.  The apparent
 prominence of the right hilum did not demonstrate any mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of previously identified pneumonia in right
 middle lobe area.  Minor scar formation remains and a followup examination in
 another few weeks is recommended to see complete reconstitution.
