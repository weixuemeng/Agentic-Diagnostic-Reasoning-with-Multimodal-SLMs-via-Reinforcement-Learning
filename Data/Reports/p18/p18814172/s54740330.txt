                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The lungs are normally expanded and clear, without
 focal airspace opacity.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is
 compatible with known paratracheal lymphadenopathy on prior CTA.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Stable
 cardiomegaly and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
