                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Question displaced endotracheal tube.  Patient with history
 of overdose.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  ET tube is in standard position,
 5.5 cm above the carina.  New bilateral perihilar and upper lobe opacities
 could be due to large areas of aspiration or hemorrhage.  There is no
 pneumothorax or effusion.
