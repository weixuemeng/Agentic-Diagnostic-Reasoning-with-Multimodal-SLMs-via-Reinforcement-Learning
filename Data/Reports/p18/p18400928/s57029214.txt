                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath cough.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 A right lower lobe opacity projects over the spine leading to a "spine sign." 
 The opacity is less clearly seen on the frontal projection.  The right heart
 border is sharp.  There is no additional consolidation effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe opacity, only evident on the lateral view may represent
 pneumonia.  If there is clinical doubt of infection, a repeat radiograph may
 be obtained with better respiratory effort.
