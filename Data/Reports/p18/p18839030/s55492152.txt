                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Four weeks of cough and pleuritic chest pain.  No symptoms of
 CHF, though the patient does have a history of coronary artery disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  There are new interstitial
 opacities particularly in the lingula but also the right lower lung, seen best
 on the frontal view.  Mild bronchial wall thickening is also apparent in the
 left hilum.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 top normal and this is likely accentuated compared to prior radiographs due to
 differences in inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New interstitial opacities in the lingula and right lower lung,
 most likely representing pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at
