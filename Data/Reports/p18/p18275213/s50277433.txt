                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with R T8 pain, hx of multpke myeloma and presumed renal cell
 carcinoma  // ?Mass, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___ and CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates numerous bilateral rib fractures
 with bony expansion in previously described on chest CT dated ___.  Lungs appear grossly clear although overlying opacities involving the
 ribs is somewhat limiting.  Increased opacity in the right paratracheal region
 is due to known posterior right rib fractures with expansion.  There is no
 opacity convincing for pneumonia.  Atelectasis at the left base is noted. 
 Severe compression deformity of T7 vertebral body which is sclerotic in
 appearance has been previously demonstrated.  Remaining vertebral body heights
 appear preserved.  Overlying bowel obscures lumbar vertebral bodies.  Heart
 size is upper limits of normal.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  There is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral rib fractures with bony expansion appears to been present on
 previous CT dated ___.  There is no large lung consolidation
 convincing for pneumonia.
