                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Irregular opacities are present within both
 lungs, though left greater than right, findings suggestive of pulmonary edema.
 No pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Thoracolumbar spinal hardware is incompletely evaluated. 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is stable and likely reflects
 chronic pleural scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New asymmetric mild pulmonary edema, left greater than right.
 2.  Probable stable bilateral pleural thickening.  No large effusions.
