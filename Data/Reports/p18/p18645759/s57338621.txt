                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 right-sided PICC is again seen terminating in the distal SVC.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated consistent with COPD/emphysema.  There is interval mild increase
 in opacity at the right lung apex; an underlying infectious process may be
 present.  Recommend followup to resolution in this patient with emphysema. 
 There is also linear scarring/atelectasis at the left lung base in similar
 distribution to that seen on the prior study.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Metallic hardware is partially imaged along the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1.  COPD/pulmonary emphysema.  Interval increase in opacity right
 upper lobe may be due to infection.  Recommend followup to resolution in this
 patient with emphysema.
