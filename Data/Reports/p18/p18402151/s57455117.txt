                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A small right hydropneumothorax is present.  The extent of air
 apically and laterally is more apparent on the current study, likely due to
 positional differences.  Additionally, there appears to be more pleural fluid
 at the right lung base, but positional differences could influence this as
 well.  Exam otherwise appears similar to the recent study with multiple right
 rib fractures again demonstrated as well as adjacent subcutaneous emphysema.
