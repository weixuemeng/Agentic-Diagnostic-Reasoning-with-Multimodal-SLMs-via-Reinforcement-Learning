                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with spontaneous R PTX.  // Assess for
 progression of PTX. Please time for 03:00am ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the chest radiograph obtained 4 hours prior, a moderate right
 pneumothorax is  increased in size.  Apparent leftward mediastinal shift is
 less conspicuous, however.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is more prominent. No
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased, moderate right pneumothorax with less conspicuous leftward
 mediastinal shift, still raising the possibility of tension.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  This study was interpreted after a subsequent radiograph
 demonstrated interval placement of a chest tube with marked improvement of the
 right pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
