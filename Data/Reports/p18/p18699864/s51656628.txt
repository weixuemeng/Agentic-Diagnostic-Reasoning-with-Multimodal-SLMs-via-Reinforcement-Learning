                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M s/p motor vehicle accident now chest discomfort  // Eval for
 rib fracture/chest trauma      Eval for rib fracture/chest trauma
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 There is no displaced rib fracture or evidence of injury to the thoracic
 organs.
 
 Lungs are chronically hyperexpanded, consistent with small airway obstruction,
 but clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are
 normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is
 seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
