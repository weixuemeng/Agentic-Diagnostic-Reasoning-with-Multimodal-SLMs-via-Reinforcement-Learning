  Lower lung volumes accentuating the bronchovascular structures.  There is
  persistent mild edema, possibly slightly worse than the prior exam.  No focal
  opacity is identified, though reevaluation after diuresis is suggested. 
  Stable cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia, high fevers, increased oral secretions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The preexisting moderate pulmonary edema is therefore visually
 more obvious than on the previous image.  Moreover, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette is increased as compared to the previous examination.  The
 simultaneous presence of parenchymal opacities reflecting pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There are no larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
