                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCV, osteo, status post toe amputation, now fever and tachycardia. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Heart size is borderline.  There is
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  No definite infiltrate is identified.  No
 effusion is seen.  No CHF.  Bilateral spinal rods are again noted.  Old healed
 right and left posterior rib fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Possibility of early pneumonic
 infiltrates cannot be entirely excluded, but no frank consolidation is
 identified.
