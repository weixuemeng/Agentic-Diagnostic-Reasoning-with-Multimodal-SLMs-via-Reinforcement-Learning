                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 16:24
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fevers and nasal congestion despite
 broad-spectrum antibiotics, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted ___ at 16:24.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Thoracic spinal hardware is again seen.  A left subclavian PICC line
 remains in place with the tip difficult to identify on the current examination
 as it overlies the spinal hardware but it is likely not significantly changed
 in position with its tip somewhere within the mid-to-distal superior vena
 cava.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs appear
 well inflated without evidence of focal air space consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  A linear opacity in the left base is again seen, likely reflecting
 scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
