                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with acute onset wheezing after blood transfusion. 
 Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 08:23.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the
 mid to lower SVC.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema is slightly worse from 3 hr prior which could be a result
 of volume overload or TRALI.  There is persistent central vascular
 engorgement.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
