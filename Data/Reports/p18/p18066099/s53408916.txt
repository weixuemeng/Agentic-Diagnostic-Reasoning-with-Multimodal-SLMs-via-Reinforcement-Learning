                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, new onset abdominal pain, assess for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two AP portable upright views of the chest and upper abdomen. 
 There is no free air.  The previously seen right medial basal parenchymal
 opacity with possibly air bronchograms is less apparent.  This could represent
 aspiration or possible developing pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of free air.   The previously seen right medial basal
 parenchymal opacity with possibly air bronchograms is smaller.  If further
 assessment is warranted, a PA and lateral films can be done.
