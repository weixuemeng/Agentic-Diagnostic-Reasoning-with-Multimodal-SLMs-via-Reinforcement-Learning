                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma with fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously visualized right medial basal parenchymal opacity has increased in
 comparison to the prior study.  Additionally, there is new increased
 opacification of the left lower lobe.  These findings are most suggestive of
 an infectious process, possibly due to aspiration.  
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remains stable with moderate cardiomegaly.
 No large pleural effusion is identified but there is blunting of bilateral
 hemidiaphragms and small pleural effusions may be present.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening of previously visualized right medial basal parenchymal opacity with
 new opacification of the left lower lobe.  These findings are suspicious for
 worsening bibasilar infectious process, possibly due to aspiration.
