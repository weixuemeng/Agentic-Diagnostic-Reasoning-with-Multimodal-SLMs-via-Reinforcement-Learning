                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and green sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded.  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung, without a correlate
 on the lateral view may be an early or developing pneumonia given the provided
 history.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. 
 There is no free air under the diaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung may represent early or
 developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  No dense
 consolidation.
