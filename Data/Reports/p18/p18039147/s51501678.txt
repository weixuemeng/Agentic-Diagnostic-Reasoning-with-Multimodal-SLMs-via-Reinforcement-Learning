                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe VATS with CT removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax following removal of the chest tube.  Subcutaneous gas continues
 to decrease.  Bibasilar opacifications persist, consistent with atelectasis
 and small pleural effusion on the right.  No vascular congestion.
