                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post right VATS with shortness of breath. 
 Study requested to rule out a pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, trace
 right apical pneumothorax persists.  Right-sided chest tube is in unchanged
 position with its tip projecting over the right lung apex.  Lung volumes
 remain low exaggerating bronchovascular structures.    Right lung base
 opacities are again identified and likely reflect post-surgical changes. The
 cardiac silhouette is normal. There still remains a small amount of
 subcutaneous gas along the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace right apical pneumothorax with small amount of subcutaneous
 gas in the right neck.  Opacities in the right lung likely reflect
 post-surgical changes.
