                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post right VATS, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 Subcutaneous gas is seen in the right lateral chest, likely post-surgical. 
 Right-sided chest tube is in place, its tip projecting over right lung apex. 
 Trace right apical pneumothorax is present.  Right lung base opacities likely
 represent post-surgical changes.  Lung volumes exaggerate bronchovascular
 markings.  Heart is normal in size.  Small amount of subcutaneous gas is also
 noted in the right neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is status post right lower lobe wedge resection.  Subcutaneous gas
 and trace right apical pneumothorax is post-surgical.  Opacity in right lung
 base likely reflects post-surgical changes.
