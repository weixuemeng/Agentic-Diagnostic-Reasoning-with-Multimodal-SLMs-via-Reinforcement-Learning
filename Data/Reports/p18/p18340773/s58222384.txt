                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, intubated in the field.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 The endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina and could be pulled back to
 avoid bronchial intubation.  The nasogastric tube follows the expected course,
 although the tip is not visualized.  There are diffuse bilateral opacities,
 which may be due to pulmonary edema but underlying infection cannot be
 excluded.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax on this supine view.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina and could be slightly pulled
 back to avoid bronchial intubation.
 2. Pulmonary edema but supervening infection cannot be excluded.
