 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:55 PM
  AS COMPARED TO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM ___, BILATERAL PLEURAL
  EFFUSIONS HAVE IMPROVED. THERE IS STILL A SMALL TO MODERATE SIZED RIGHT AND A
  SMALL LEFT-SIDED PLEURAL EFFUSION.  INCREASED DENSITY AT THE RIGHT LUNG BASE
  LIKELY REFLECTS ATELECTASIS, HOWEVER AN UNDERLYING INFECTIOUS PROCESS CANNOT
  BE ENTIRELY EXCLUDED. HOWEVER OVERALL, FINDINGS APPEAR IMPROVED SINCE PRIOR
  EXAMINATION. MULTIPLE RIB FRACTURES ARE AGAIN SEEN. THERE IS NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
  FINDINGS DISCUSSED WITH DR ___ BY NSR VIA PHONE ON ___ AT 1:50 PM

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multitrauma. Pre-op for LLE skin
 debridement, grafting, etc  // eval for acute process Surg: ___ (LLE skin
 debridement/graft)    eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 12:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13 10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again seen. Overall, there is improved
 aeration throughout the lungs with the exception of the right base where there
 continues to be focal opacity and associated right pleural effusion. A smaller
 left pleural effusion is likely.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Stable
 cardiac and mediastinal contours.  No pneumothorax.
