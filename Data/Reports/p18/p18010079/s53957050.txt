                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with rib fracture, evaluate rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient was examined in sitting upright position.  Analysis is
 performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar chest
 examination of ___.  Previously suspected tiny residual of
 pneumothorax in the left apical area cannot be identified anymore.  Also, the
 at that time existing pleural thickenings occurred in conjunction with the
 multiple rib injury has regressed.  Left lung is now well aerated and no
 evidence of remaining pulmonary atelectasis.  Heart size is unchanged and
 within normal limits.  No new pulmonary abnormalities identified.  No gross
 malalignment of the lateral structures in the thorax.  Observed that the
 patient is still unable to elevate his left arm for the lateral view.  With
 regard to the question concerning rib fractures, the previous torso CT
 examination of ___ is reviewed.  Rib injuries consisted of
 minimally displaced right transverse process fractures involving L2 through
 L4.  In addition to bilateral first rib fractures, there were injuries in the
 medial posterior portions of the left second, third, and fourth rib.  Mildly
 comminuted fractures existed also posteriorly in the eighth and ninth rib,
 with slight displacement.  There was also a fracture of the scapula.  All
 these injuries are impossible to identify in detail on the routine PA and
 lateral chest examination.  Assessment for possible changes of these injuries
 would require performance of a followup CT examination.  Gross changes in
 position cannot be identified.
