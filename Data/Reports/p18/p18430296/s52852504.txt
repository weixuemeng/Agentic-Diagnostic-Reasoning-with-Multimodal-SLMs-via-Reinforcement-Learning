                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  Prominent calcifications of the aortic knob have a stable
 radiographic appearance.  Lungs remain clear, and there are no pleural
 effusions or concerning acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic findings to account for hemoptysis.  If symptoms
 persist, consider CT of the chest to exclude a radiographically occult cause
 for this symptom.
