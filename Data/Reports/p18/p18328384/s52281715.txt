                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS and IMPRESSION: There is a massive right pleural effusion with
 associated leftward shift of the mediastinum.  A small portion of the right
 upper lung remains aerated.  A small locule of air is seen within the right
 mid-lung which could reflect a cavitation.  A 2.5 cm nodule is seen in the
 left lower lung, best appreciated on the frontal view.  Comparison should be
 made to prior imaging if available, otherwise, a dedicated chest CT would be
 recommended.  There is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
