                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R thoracentesis for malignant effusion,
 with possible loculated pneumothorax on portable film  // better visualization
 of previously seen possible R loculated PTX     better visualization of
 previously seen possible R loculated PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is been a right
 thoracentesis with no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.  Dense streak
 of atelectasis is less prominent.
 On the left, there is again increased opacification at the base silhouetting
 the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
