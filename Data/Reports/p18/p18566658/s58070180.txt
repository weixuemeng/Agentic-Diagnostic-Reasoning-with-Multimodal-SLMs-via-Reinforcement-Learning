                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with b/l pleural effusions s/p L pigtail ___
 (now removed) with 800mL out s/p R ___ ___mL removed  // ? PTX     ?
 PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs and routine chest CT scan ___.
 
 Little if any right pleural effusion remains.  Small left pleural effusion
 unchanged.  No left pneumothorax following removal of the basal pigtail
 pleural drainage catheter.  Some loculated pneumothorax could be present on
 the right.  A lateral view would be very helpful in assessing whether there is
 any air in the right hemi thorax.
 
 Large band of atelectasis in the right lung conforms to the minor fissure and
 the orientation of the right hilus suggests atelectasis of at least the
 posterior basal segment in the lower lobe.  The upper lungs are clear.  Heart
 is not enlarged.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs when
 feasible.
