                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent fall, L rib fractures, possible left hemothorax,
 evaluate for hemothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and outside CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a persistent opacity at the left lung base obscuring the
 hemidiaphragm, secondary to a combination of a large pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. The appearance at the left lung base is overall unchanged since
 radiograph performed one day prior.  There is also a small right pleural
 effusion. Moderate interstitial edema has developed in the interim. Pulmonary
 nodules are better assessed on the chest CT performed one day prior. The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. The included
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No significant interval change to the opacity at the left lung base due to
 a combination of large left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion, also unchanged.
 
 3.  Moderate interstitial edema.
