                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia and congestive heart
 failure.  
 
 COMPARISON:  High-resolution CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrates a left chest wall
 pacemaker generator with shock coils in the SVC and right ventricle.  The
 heart is enlarged, as before.  There has been interval increase in
 interstitial markings and pulmonary redistribution consistent with congestive
 heart failure.  Additionally, there is peribronchial cuffing.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  The hilar bronchovascular structures are crowded.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increase in interstitial markings, peribronchial cuffing, vascular
 redistribution, and bronchovascular crowding, consistent with congestive heart
 failure.
