                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx CHF EF ___%, c/o SOB, worse supine, worse with
 exertion. Also c/o nonproductive cough. Denies pain.  // Acute process in
 chest?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT. .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left chest wall pacing device is again seen. Massive enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is as on prior. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings
 are seen on the current exam. Small right-sided pleural effusion is apparently
 new. Increased soft tissue density at the thoracic inlet with rightward
 deviation of the trachea is compatible with known left-sided thyroid
 enlargement. Focal opacity projecting over the right anterior third rib is
 more conspicuous on today's exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Massive cardiomegaly. Interstitial edema and small right effusion.
 Focal opacity projecting over the right third rib potentially due to edema but
 followup after treatment is suggested to document resolution.
