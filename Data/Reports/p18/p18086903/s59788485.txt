                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with question TIA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation.  Increased opacity in
 the right hilar region is likely due to projection and in part due to
 patient's spine projecting in this region from mid thoracic mild
 dextroscoliosis.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Known pulmonary
 nodules are not clearly identified on this x-ray.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits, noting a tortuous thoracic aorta. 
 Surgical clips identified in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
