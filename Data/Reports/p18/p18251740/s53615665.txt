                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and orthostasis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is mild unfolding of the upper
 thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 are streaky band-like opacities in the medial right lower and in the right
 upper lung, most compatible with mild atelectasis, while a more generalized
 interstitial abnormality has resolved.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Resolution of interstitial
 abnormality.  Band-like opacities compatible with minor atelectasis in the
 right lung.
