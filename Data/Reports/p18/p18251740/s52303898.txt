                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea, fever, productive cough.  Please
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening, with
 increased vascular markings and upper re-distribution.  There is a more
 confluent opacity in the right lung base. There is a small right-sided pleural
 effusion and fluid tracking along the major fissure of the right lung, better
 seen in the lateral view.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial marking may be due to fluid overload.
 Superimposed infectious process not excluded. More confluent opacity in the
 right lung base might be secondary to summation of structures although
 consolidation is not excluded.
