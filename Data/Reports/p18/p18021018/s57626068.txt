                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Ascending aorta repair  // eval for pleural
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube again courses into the stomach.  Left PICC line is in the mid
 SVC.
 
 Lung volumes are significantly lower with vascular crowding but no frank
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and likely top
 normal.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum likely relates to lordotic
 positioning.  Bilateral pleural effusions of present are small.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Significantly lower lung volumes and lordotic positioning limit the
 evaluation.
 2. Small if any bilateral pleural effusions.
