 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath, history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated consistent with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Slight prominence of interstitium is grossly stable to prior, likely
 related to underlying emphysema.  The interstitium appears minimally increased
 as compared to the prior, which could be due to component of mild fluid
 overload.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is minimal left base atelectasis.
