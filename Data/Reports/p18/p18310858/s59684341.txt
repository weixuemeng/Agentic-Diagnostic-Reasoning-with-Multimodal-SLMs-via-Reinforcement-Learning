                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with increased interstitial markings throughout suggesting of
 chronic interstitial process.  Biapical scarring is again noted.  More linear
 retrocardiac opacity persists and is likely due to scarring.  The cardiac
 silhouette is slightly enlarged but stable in configuration.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is noted at the aortic arch.  Blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles is again seen, possibly due to small effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation.  Increased interstitial markings likely due to
 chronic changes.
