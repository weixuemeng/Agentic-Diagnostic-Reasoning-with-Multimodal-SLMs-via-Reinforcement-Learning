                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  This is a ___ F from ___, recent diagnosis of bilateral
 cryptogenic pneumonia, PMR, Afib, NSTEMI last week, cath with 4VD,  sCHF (EF
 ___%), who initially presented with fever and respiratory  distress to BI-N. 
 // evaluate interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 NG tube present, extending beneath diaphragm.  The tip overlies the stomach. 
 The sideport likely also overlies the stomach, but may lie just distal to the
 GE junction.  A left IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen areextensive diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities and as well as
 increased retrocardiac density, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, and of
 the extreme lateral right hemidiaphragm.  Confluent biapical opacity again
 noted.  The overall appearance is similar to the prior study, allowing for
 technical differences.  The right hemidiaphragm is slightly better defined on
 today's examination, which could reflect very slight improvement at the right
 lung base.  The possibility of bilateral small effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Extensive diffuse bilateral patchy opacities, overall similar to the prior
 study, would possible slight clearing at the right lung base.
