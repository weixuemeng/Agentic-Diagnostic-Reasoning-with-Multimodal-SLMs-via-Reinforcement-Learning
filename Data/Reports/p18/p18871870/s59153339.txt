                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, ?ILD, fever overnight  // Any
 evidence of consolidation, pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multifocal airspace opacities with peripheral and basilar predominance have
 been progressively worsening since ___, suggesting subacute time
 course.  Mediastinal contours and heart borders are normal.  No substantial
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal opacities with peripheral basilar predominance suggest cryptogenic
 organizing pneumonia, less likely subacute eosinophilic pneumonia or subacute
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis which could have a similar appearance but
 typically have an upper lobe predominance not seen in this patient. 
 Appearance inconsistent with infectious pneumonia.
