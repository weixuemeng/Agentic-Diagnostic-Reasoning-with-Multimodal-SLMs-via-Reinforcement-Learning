 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hiatal hernia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two views, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 5.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip
 not imaged.  A large quantity of subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest
 wall, as well as the base of the right neck with moderate quantity at the base
 of the left neck as well.  There is still a round lucency suggesting a stomach
 bubble along the left lower mediastinum, although the course of the orogastric
 tube now runs straight into the upper abdomen; correlation with surgical
 history suggested.  There is new mild interstitial prominence suggesting mild
 vascular congestion and bilateral layering pleural effusions are suspected,
 greater on the left than right.
