                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post lap Nissen fundoplication for paraesophageal hernia. 
 Evaluation for interval change.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is an interval removal of an endotracheal tube and feeding tube.  
 
 Again seen is a moderate left pleural effusion and opacification of the left
 base consistent with collapse.  Also seen is a small right pleural effusion
 and opacification of the right base consistent with atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
  
 Bilateral pleural effusions with left lower lobe collapse and mild right base
 atelectasis largely unchanged from the prior study.
