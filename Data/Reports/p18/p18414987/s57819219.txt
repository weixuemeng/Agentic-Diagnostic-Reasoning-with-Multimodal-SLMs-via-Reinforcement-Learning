 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 15 21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left
 internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. 
 There are patchy opacities within both lower lungs which would be concerning
 for aspiration or pneumonia. In addition, there are layering effusions.
 Overall, the lungs are hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. No
 pneumothorax. Deformity of several of the right upper posterior ribs is again
 seen likely related to old trauma.
