                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ng tube placement  // assess tube position
 assess tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13:33 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the
 carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  A left internal jugular central line is unchanged in
 position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is
 persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle and tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm suggestive of volume loss in the right lung which is likely
 postoperative. There continues to be more focal patchy opacity at both bases,
 although this has somewhat improved since the prior study.  Findings would be
 consistent with resolving pulmonary edema with an atypical distribution due to
 underlying emphysema, less likely improving pneumonia.  Note that the 2 cm
 spiculated peripheral right lower lobe mass seen on recent chest CT ___ is not radiographically apparent.
