  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. 
  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the side hole is just distal to
  the GE junction and advancement can be considered. Right lung base opacity
  remains essentially unchanged. There is increased density at the left lung
  base, in the appropriate clinical setting a superimposed infection cannot be
  excluded. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by NSR via telephone on ___ at 20:06, ___ min after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary edema s/p inbutation s/p ng
 placed  // eval for ng placement      eval for ng placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 an endotracheal tube with extends to about 4.6 cm above the carina. While the
 orogastric tube extends to the body of the stomach, with the side hole at
 about the level of the esophagogastric junction.  This should be pushed
 forward EF possible. Postsurgical changes in the right hemithorax again seen.
 Increased opacity at the left base process, with possible other focus in the
 upper to midportion of the lung.  This appearance is worrisome for
 superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
