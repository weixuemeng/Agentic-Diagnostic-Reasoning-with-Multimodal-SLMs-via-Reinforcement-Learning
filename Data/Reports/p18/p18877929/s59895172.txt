                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left lower lobe lobectomy, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___/ at 14:15 p.m., I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 Tubing overlies the left lung, unchanged.  Increased retrocardiac density
 medially is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.  Otherwise, the left
 lung is clear.  The right lung is also grossly clear.  The mediastinum may be
 very slightly shifted to the left.  In addition, right convex scoliosis of the
 lower thoracic spine is noted.  
 
 No gross left-sided pneumothorax is detected, but a curvilinear density
 overlying the left clavicle medially could reflect a small left apical
 pneumothorax.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
