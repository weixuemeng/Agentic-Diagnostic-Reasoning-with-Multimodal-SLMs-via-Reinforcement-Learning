                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left lower lobectomy, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is a small left pneumothorax, similar to ___ at 9:17 a.m., though
 possibly slightly smaller.  The left chest tube is again noted.  Again seen is
 increased retrocardiac density, with new or more apparent blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small left effusion.  
 
 Of note, a fluid level projects over the heart.  On lateral view, this appears
 to lie in the posterior chest.  
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Hazy density in the right cardiophrenic
 region is consistent with atelectasis, more pronounced compared with one day
 earlier.  No CHF or right-sided effusion.  
 
 Right convex scoliosis again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left apical pneumothorax, possibly slightly improved.
 
 2.  New or more apparent small left effusion.
 
 3.  Fluid level projecting over the cardiac silhouette medially.  The lateral
 film suggests that it lies posterior and, if so, this fluid more likely
 represents a loculated pneumothorax, rather than a hiatal hernia. Moreover,
 targeted review of the ___ chest CT does not show evidence of a hiatal
 hernia.
 
 4.  Right cardiophrenic atelectasis and trace right-sided pleural fluid.
