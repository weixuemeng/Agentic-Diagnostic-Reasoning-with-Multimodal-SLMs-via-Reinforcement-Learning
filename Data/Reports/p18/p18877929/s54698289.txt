                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, status post left lower lobe VATS wedge
 resection, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is
 persistent blunting of the left CP angle which likely represents a small
 residual pleural effusion.  Trace effusion is also likely present on the
 right.  In general, there has been improved aeration at the right lung base. 
 There is likely residual compressive atelectasis at the left lung base.  The
 mid and upper lungs appear well aerated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in lower lung aeration with persistent
 effusions, left greater than right, with probable mild left basilar
 atelectasis.
