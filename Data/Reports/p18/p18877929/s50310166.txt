 HISTORY:  Fever 1 month status post left lower lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Left lower lobe effusion and

 the right costophrenic angle is unchanged.  There is no additional airspace
 opacity or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing left lower lobe effusion and overlying atelectasis may be part of

 cannot be excluded in a symptomatic patient.
