                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 HISTORY:  Lower lobectomy.  Chest tube removal.  Assess for interval change.
 
 Two views.  Comparison with the previous study done ___.  Left chest tube has
 been removed in the interval.  There appears to be slight interval increase in
 a small left pneumothorax.  A persistent air-fluid level in the posterior left
 chest and hazy increased density at the right lung base consistent with
 atelectasis, consolidation or pleural fluid is stable.  Mediastinal structures
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in left pneumothorax post chest tube
 removal.
