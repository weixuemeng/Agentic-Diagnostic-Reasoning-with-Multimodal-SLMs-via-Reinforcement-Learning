                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD and hemoptysis, intubated for IR
 bronchial artery embolization // Please eval ET tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Heart size is normal.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Allowing for differences in patient
 positioning, the right apical cavitary process with previously seen air-fluid
 level is probably not significantly changed, as the size of the cavitation
 appears similar.  The air-fluid level is probably no longer seen due to the
 patient being supine. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
