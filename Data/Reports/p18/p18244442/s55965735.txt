                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite pleural effusion is seen on the lateral
 view.  There is rounded retrocardiac opacity seen, which was not optimally
 assessed on this study, may be due to a large hiatal hernia.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty in the mid-to-lower thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large retrocardiac rounded opacity may correspond to a large
 hiatal hernia.  Correlate with history of such.  Basilar atelectasis without
 definite focal consolidation.
