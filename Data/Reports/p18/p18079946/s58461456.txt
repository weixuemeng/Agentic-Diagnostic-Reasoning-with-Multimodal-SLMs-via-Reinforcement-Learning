                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right thoracotomy
 with right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The current radiograph demonstrates filling-in of the right apical space by
 fluid.  There is also some lateral fluid loculation adjacent to the surgically
 fractured right sixth rib.  The appearance of the hilus after surgery is
 unremarkable.  Basal amount of pleural fluid/thickening is mild.  Left lung is
 clear.  No left pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Right mediastinal shift is
 minimal and might reflect the combination of volume reduction of the lung with
 present pleural effusion.
