                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post right upper lobectomy and lymph node
 dissection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Widened mediastinum has improved.  Pulmonary edema has improved, now mild. 
 Low lung volumes persist.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  There is a
 small right pneumothorax, better seen on the lateral view.  Right apical chest
 tube is in unchanged position.  Right subcutaneous emphysema has increased. 
 Peripheral right mid lung opacity is new, likely accumulation of pleural fluid
 and adjacent atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
