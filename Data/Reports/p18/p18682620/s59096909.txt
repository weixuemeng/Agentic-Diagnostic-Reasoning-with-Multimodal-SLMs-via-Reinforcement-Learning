                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal enlargement of the vascular diameter might suggest mild fluid
 overload.  This is supported by the moderate cardiomegaly that is unchanged as
 compared to the previous examination.  No pleural effusions.  Lower lung
 volumes.  No pneumonia or other acute lung changes.  The left pectoral
 pacemaker is in unchanged position.
