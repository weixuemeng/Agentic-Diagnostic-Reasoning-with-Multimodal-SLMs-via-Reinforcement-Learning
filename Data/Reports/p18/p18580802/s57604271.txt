 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion seen on RUQ ultrasound 
 // quantify size of effusion, other pathology      quantify size of effusion,
 other pathology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without definite vascular congestion.  This discordance raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Multiple streaks of
 atelectasis are seen, especially overlying the cardiac silhouette on the
 lateral view.  The costophrenic angles posteriorly are quite well seen with
 minimal if any pleural effusion.
 There is an impression on the lower cervical trachea, consistent with a
 thyroid mass.
