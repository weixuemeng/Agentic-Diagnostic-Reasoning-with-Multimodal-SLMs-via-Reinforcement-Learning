                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with breast cancer on chemotherapy now with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged,
 with the heart size appearing within normal limits. No pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are re- demonstrated, though
 the size of these effusions appears slightly decreased compared to the prior
 exam. Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect
 atelectasis. Infection, however, is not completely excluded.  No pneumothorax
 is seen. Remote fracture of the right mid clavicle is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased in the interval, with
 continued bibasilar streaky and linear opacities most likely reflective of
 atelectasis. Infection, however, is not completely excluded.
