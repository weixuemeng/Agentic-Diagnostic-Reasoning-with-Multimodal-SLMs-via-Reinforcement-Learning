 COMPARISON:  Comparison to previous study dated ___ at 20:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 13:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath remains in place.  Interval decrease in the right pleural
 effusion with improved aeration at the right base and some residual
 atelectasis.  There is a smaller basilar medial opacity which could reflect
 residual loculated fluid or pleural thickening.  The smaller left effusion
 remains unchanged.  Patchy opacities at the left base are suggestive of
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Old right
 midclavicular fracture.
