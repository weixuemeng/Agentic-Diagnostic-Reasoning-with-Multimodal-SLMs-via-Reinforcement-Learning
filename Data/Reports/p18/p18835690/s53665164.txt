 near the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval increase in right
 lobulated pleural thickening both laterally and medially at the base as well
 as at the left costophrenic angle.  Findings may reflect loculated fluid,
 although an underlying pleural abnormality should also be considered. Patchy
 opacities at both bases may reflect atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Old right
 mid clavicular fracture.
