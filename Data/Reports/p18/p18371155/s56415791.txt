                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates multiple surgical clips
 overlying the left hemithorax and a right PICC terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction, unchanged.  The patient is rotated, resulting in increased right
 hilar prominence and apparent heart size.  Allowing for changes in position
 and lower lung volumes, there is no definite focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, allowing for changes in
 position and lower lung volumes.
