                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and crackles at the bases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates surgical clips which project over
 the left mediastinal border and centrally over the heart.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Density in the
 retrocardiac region seen only on the lateral view in the appropriate clinical
 setting could reflect developing pneumonia.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Imaged upper abdomen demonstrates no air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, density in the retrocardiac region could
 reflect developing pneumonia.
