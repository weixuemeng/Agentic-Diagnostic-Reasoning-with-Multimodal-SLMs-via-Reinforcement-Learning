                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Interval distention of the
 azygos vein, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal
 interstitial edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities are present, as well as small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by interstitial edema and small
 pleural effusions.
 2.  Patchy bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, but
 aspiration and developing pneumonia are additional considerations.
