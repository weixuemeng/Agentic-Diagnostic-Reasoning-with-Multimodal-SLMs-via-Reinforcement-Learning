                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe tracheobronchomalacia, admitted
 for shortness of breath, evaluate for acute process.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ as well as selected CT images dated
 ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat diminished but unchanged.  There is linear opacity
 at the left base, which likely reflects scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. 
 No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There is a suggestion of some narrowing of the trachea
 and mainstem bronchi which is consistent with the known diagnosis of
 tracheobronchomalacia.
