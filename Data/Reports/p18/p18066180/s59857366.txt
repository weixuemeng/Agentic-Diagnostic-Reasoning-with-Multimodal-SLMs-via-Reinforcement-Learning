 INDICATION:  Cough and low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new left basilar linear opacity most likely represents
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A small new
 left pleural effusion is present.  There has been a mild increase in the
 pulmonary vasculature engorgement, but no interstitial edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette has slightly increased in size from the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable left basilar atelectasis, although aspiration or small new
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement without evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
