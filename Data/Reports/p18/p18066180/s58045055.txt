                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of Nissen
 fundoplication and NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable within the limitations of this
 portable semi-erect study.  The patient has a mild volume overload.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Surgical changes in the
 fourth right rib are redemonstrated.
