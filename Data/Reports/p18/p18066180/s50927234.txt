                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post Nissen procedure on ___ with
 remote tracheoplasty, here to reevaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show interval
 resolution of linear atelectasis previously seen in the left lung base on
 ___ with improved visualization of the left hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle without evidence of pleural effusion on the
 corresponding lateral radiograph is likely due to pleural thickening or
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged from the preceding
 radiograph.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Partial resection of
 the right posterior fourth rib is unchanged.  Segmental narrowing of the lower
 trachea may be related to prior surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Resolved atelectasis of the left lung base from ___.
