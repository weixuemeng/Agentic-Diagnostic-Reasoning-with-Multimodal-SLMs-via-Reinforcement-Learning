                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-tracheal stent placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, likely to reflect lesser inspiratory effort.  However, no
 signs of fluid overload or pulmonary edema present.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette, no pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.
