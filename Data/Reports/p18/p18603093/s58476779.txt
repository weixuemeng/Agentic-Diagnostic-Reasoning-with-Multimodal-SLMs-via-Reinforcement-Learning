                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, now extubated with ongoing hypoxia,
 question edema or infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 10:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  When compared to the prior study, there has been significant interval
 improvement in bilateral airspace process, favoring that this represented
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema rather than an acute infectious process. 
 There continues to be a more subtle interstitial abnormality for which
 continued followup imaging may be helpful.  No large effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given differences in patient positioning and inspiration.
