                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Interpreted in conjunction with a concurrent
 CT examination.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Right greater than left bibasilar opacities are improved compared to the prior
 examination.  The right base opacity corresponds to focal pneumonia or infarct
 on CT.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Many findings are seen only on the concurrent CT exam including
 diffuse pulmonary embolus, peribronchovascular nodularity, and numerous foci
 of ground glass attenuation.  Only the right lung basal pneumonia or infarct
 is apparent on conventional radiography.
