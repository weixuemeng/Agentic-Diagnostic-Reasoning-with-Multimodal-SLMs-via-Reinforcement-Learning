                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:06 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with type 1 diabetes, insulin overdose, found
 down, vomited, suspect ARDS.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient is still intubated, ET tube in standard placement, but severe
 bilateral perihilar consolidation has improved sufficiently that one can
 exclude non-cardiogenic edema as the cause of bulk of the abnormality. 
 Instead, I suspect massive aspiration has partially cleared, was accompanied
 by pulmonary edema that has also improved, and now the patient will be subject
 to multifocal pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe where
 consolidation is most severe.  Heart size is normal.  ET tube is in standard
 placement, along with right internal jugular line and upper anterior gastric
 drainage tube.
