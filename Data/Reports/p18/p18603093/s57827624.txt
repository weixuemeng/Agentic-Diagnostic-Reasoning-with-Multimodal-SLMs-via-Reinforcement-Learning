                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:24 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hypoxia and new right lung opacity,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:24 a.m. is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is increasing indistinctness of the perihilar
 vasculature and interstitium which suggests worsening mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflects atelectasis
 given low lung volumes, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.  No
 large effusions.
