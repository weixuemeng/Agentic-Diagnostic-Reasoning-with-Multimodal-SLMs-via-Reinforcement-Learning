                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with asthma and sarcoid and
 currently coughing green sputum with asthma flare.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are overall essentially
 clear with unchanged appearance of the right upper and left upper pulmonary
 nodules seen on the prior radiograph.  No new consolidations to suggest
 infectious process demonstrated as well as there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be
 considered.
