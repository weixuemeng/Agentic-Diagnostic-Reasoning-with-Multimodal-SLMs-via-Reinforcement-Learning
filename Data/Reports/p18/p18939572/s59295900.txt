                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF exacerbation, hx of Rectal CA
 resection, here for CHF exacerbation and anemia.  // R/O interval change.
 Patient with low-grade persistent leukocytosis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion are persistent findings, as well as linear bibasilar
 atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion.  No new areas of consolidation
 are identified to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  Lucencies within the
 proximal left humerus raise the possibility of malignant bone disease, and
 further evaluation could be performed with dedicated humeral radiographs for
 initial further evaluation if warranted clinically.
