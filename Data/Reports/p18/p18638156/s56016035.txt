                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Known neuroendocrine tumor, here with increased chest
 pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided Port-a-Cath is seen terminating in the mid-to-lower
 SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Abnormality
 of the anterior right fifth ribs and T11 vertebral body lesions were better
 assessed on recent prior CT.  No definite focal consolidation seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Small amounts of high
 density are seen in the visualized bowel in the left abdomen, which likely
 relate to residual oral contrast from recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
