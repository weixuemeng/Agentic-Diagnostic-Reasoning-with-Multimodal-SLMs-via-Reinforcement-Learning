                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with infiltrate, has lesion of ___ resolved?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding two chest examinations
 of ___ and ___.  The heart size remains within normal
 limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Similar as on
 previous examinations, there is a mild degree of S-shaped scoliosis with
 right-sided prominence in the lower thoracic and left-sided prominence in the
 upper lumbar spine area.  The course of the descending aorta follows curvature
 but is otherwise unremarkable.  No local contour abnormalities of the aorta
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in apical area.  A single metallic
 surgical clip is identified to the right of the midline overlying the central
 portion of the first rib, most likely represents local surgery or node biopsy
 in the past.
 
 When comparison is made with the previous examinations, a local pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrate of bronchopneumonic character was seen adjacent to the
 apical portion of the heart on the left lung base.  On followup examination
 performed on ___, this density had resolved almost completely.  On
 the present examination, some linear scar formations can be identified but no
 acute pneumonic process remains.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates.
