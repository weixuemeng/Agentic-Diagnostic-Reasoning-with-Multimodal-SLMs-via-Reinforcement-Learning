                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Presumed lymphoma, currently undergoing workup, presenting with
 worsening fatigue and malaise.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A posterior opacity may be
 due to trace bilateral pleural effusions, and possibly also a left lower lobe
 consolidation versus atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
