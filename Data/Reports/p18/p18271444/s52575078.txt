                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis and respiratory failure, to assess for ET tube migration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains
 well positioned, approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions persist, more prominent on the left.  Volume loss at the left base
 is again seen.  Apparent shift of the mediastinum to the left may merely
 reflect some obliquity of the patient.
 
 The right IJ catheter has been removed.
