                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with acute respiratory failure, on
 mechanical ventilation with acute desaturation to 70s-80s.  Evaluate ETT
 position and possible mucus plugging.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the
 same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mediastinal and cardiac structures unchanged.  Thus, no evidence of
 significant cardiac enlargement.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 Hazy density on left base most likely representing pleural effusion and
 atelectasis remains unchanged in comparison with the next preceding portable
 chest examination.  Left-sided PICC line in unchanged position terminating in
 lower SVC.  No pneumothorax has developed.  ETT remains in unchanged position
 and is at least 4 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Unchanged chest findings.  No reoccurrence of previously encountered
 mediastinal shift towards the left.
