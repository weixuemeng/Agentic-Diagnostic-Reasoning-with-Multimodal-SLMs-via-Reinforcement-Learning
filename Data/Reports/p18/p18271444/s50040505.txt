 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  The extent of the bilateral pleural
 effusions is constant, as are the areas of subsequent bilateral atelectasis at
 the lung bases.  A linear opacity on the right is caused by a skinfold.  No
 newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
