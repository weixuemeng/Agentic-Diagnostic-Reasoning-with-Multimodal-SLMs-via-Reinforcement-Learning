                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with Crohn's, hypotension and bowel
 edema seen on CT, questionable abdominal perforation.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding portable
 chest examination obtained nine hours earlier during the same day.  Heart size
 remains unchanged and not enlarged.  Patient remains intubated, the ET
 terminating in the trachea 3 cm above the level of the carina.  Previously
 described right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line in
 unchanged position.  The previously identified malplaced NG tube that reversed
 in cranial direction has now been adjusted.  Density manipulation of the image
 allows to identify the new NG tube, which passes through the entire esophagus
 and terminates in the mid portion of the upper abdomen in paravertebral
 position to the left.  It is probably terminating in the stomach including its
 side port.  In response to the given information, there is no conclusive
 evidence of free abdominal air under the diaphragmatic contours.  The validity
 of such exclusion must, however, be questionable as the patient is in marked
 tilted position.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
