 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe collapse with mucus plug removed.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac
 silhouette is now midline consistent with removal of mucus plug.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions persist with compressive atelectasis at the bases. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
