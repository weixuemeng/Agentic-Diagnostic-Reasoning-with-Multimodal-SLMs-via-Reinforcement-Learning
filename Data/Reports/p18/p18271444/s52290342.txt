                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with neutropenia and colitis status post central
 line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 12:24 a.m.  
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A nasoenteric catheter courses
 to the level of the GE junction, then upturns upon itself with the tip at the
 level of the upper esophagus.  Re-positioning is recommended.  There has been
 interval placement of a right central venous catheter which terminates in the
 mid SVC.  Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There
 are increased interstitial opacities suggestive of developing mild pulmonary
 edema.  Known trace pleural effusions are not well visualized. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips within the right upper quadrant are from prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned nasoenteric catheter looped in the distal esophagus ends in
 the proximal, re-positioning recommended.
 2.  New central venous line in the mid SVC.
 3.  Probable increasing mild interstitial pulmonary edema
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the information about the malpositioned
 catheter to Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:30 am by telephone.
