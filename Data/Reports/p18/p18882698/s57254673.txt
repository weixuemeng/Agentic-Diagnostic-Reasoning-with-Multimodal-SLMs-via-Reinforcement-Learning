                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right pleurodesis.
 
 AP radiograph was reviewed.
 
 There is unchanged right mediastinal shift.  At least partially loculated
 right pleural effusion appears to be unchanged since the prior study.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Left lung is essentially clear.  Overall, no substantial
 change since the prior examination has been demonstrated.
