                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___F with 2 days of SOB.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are low
 which limits evaluation.  Bronchovascular crowding atelectasis likely accounts
 for subtle increased opacity in the lower lungs.  There is no convincing
 evidence of pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 size appears grossly stable though suboptimally assessed.  Mediastinal contour
 is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited, negative.
