                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable aside from mild tortuosity of the aorta.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Vague opacities at the lung bases are more
 suggestive of minor atelectasis than pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal basilar opacification more suggestive of minor atelectasis than
 pneumonia.  Enlarged heart.
