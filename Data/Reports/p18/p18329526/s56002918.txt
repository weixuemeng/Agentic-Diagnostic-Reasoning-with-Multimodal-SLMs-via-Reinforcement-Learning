                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ___ disease, spinal fusion, shortness of
 breath, cough, and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the infrahilar right lung is due in part to
 small fissural pleural collection appreciated on the lateral view, but likely
 consolidation as well.  Left infrahilar opacification could be bronchiectasis.
 Left heart border is partially obscured, either by parenchymal abnormality in
 the lingula or mediastinal fat.  This obscures the apex of what is probably a
 mildly enlarged heart.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Gut in the upper abdomen is moderately distended.  Spinal
 stimulator noted at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 If clinical situation is unclear, I would recommend CT scanning to clarify the
 intrathoracic abnormalities.
