                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever and tachycardia.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.  Study is read in conjunction with
 the abdomen CT 5:20 a.m. on ___ at imaging the lower chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild atelectasis is evident at the left lung base laterally. Since the right
 hemidiaphragm is more elevated than the left, consolidation in the infrahilar
 right lung is also most likely atelectasis.    Upper lungs are clear.  Low
 lung volumes exaggerate size of the heart which could be mildly enlarged.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusions small FNH.
