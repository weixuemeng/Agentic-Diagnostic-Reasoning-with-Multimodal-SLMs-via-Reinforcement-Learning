                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, altered mental status, intubated,
 concern for aspiration PNA.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, 4:21.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT tip projects approximately 4 cm from the carina.  The right internal
 jugular venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the SVC-RA
 junction.  An enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper
 quadrant and its tip is beyond the scope of the time.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Bilateral airspace opacities, more conspicuous on
 the left compared to the right may reflect asymmetric edema or concurrent
 action.  Small bilateral layering pleural effusions are minimally changed. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged bronchovascular crowding and pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
