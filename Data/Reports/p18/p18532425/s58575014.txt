                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis/severe alcoholic hepatitis and
 sepsis of unclear source.  Evaluate for interval change, more precisely
 opacities suggestive of PNA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, exaggerating interstitial opacities and heart size.
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged from prior.  Interstitial opacities, which
 may be atelectasis as well as edema, is not significantly worsened.  However,
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral effusion is likely. 
 There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
