                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, intubated  // please
 assess ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT tip projects approximately 2.5 cm from the carina, slightly low.  Enteric
 tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant.  Right IJ catheter
 tip projects over the expected region of the SVC-RA junction, unchanged.
 Lung volumes remain low with bronchovascular congestion.  Interval decrease in
 lower lung opacity.  Persistent bibasilar moderate atelectasis.  Interval
 increase in bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increased bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased opacity in the
 right lower lobe could reflect developing pneumonia.
