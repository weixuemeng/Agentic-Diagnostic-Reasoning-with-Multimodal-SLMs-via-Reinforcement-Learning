                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear except for
 questionable minimal opacity at the left costophrenic angle, potentially
 representing summation of shadows, since no abnormality is demonstrated on the
 lateral view.  Since those findings are consistent with the area of pain,
 further correlation with oblique views or potentially chest CT to exclude the
 possibility of pulmonary embolism  is required.
