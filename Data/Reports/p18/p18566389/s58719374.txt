                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers, chills, malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large area of consolidation in the right lower lobe, highly worrisome for
 pneumonia.  The left lung is essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
