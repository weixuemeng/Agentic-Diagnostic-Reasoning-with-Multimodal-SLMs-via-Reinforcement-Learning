                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a PICC for IV antibiotics.  Evaluate PICC
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left subclavian approach PICC tip projects over the expected region of the
 mid SVC.  Since ___, a left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. 
 Bibasilar opacities also have essentially resolved with perhaps minimal left
 lower lobe residual opacity.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine are moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left PICC tip ends in the mid SVC.
 2.  Left pleural effusion has resolved.
 3.  Improved bibasilar parenchymal opacities with perhaps minimal residual in
 the left lower lobe.
