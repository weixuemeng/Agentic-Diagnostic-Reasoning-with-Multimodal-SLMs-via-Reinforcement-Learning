 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with fever and hypotension.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a pacemaker and median sternotomy wires and valve
 replacements that appear unchanged.  There are again seen some hazy densities
 at the lung bases, left greater than right which may represent atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia.  There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or
 pneumothoraces.
