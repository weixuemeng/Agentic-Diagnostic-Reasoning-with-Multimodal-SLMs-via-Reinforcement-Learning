                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left effusion, status post
 thoracocentesis with 900 cc taken out.  Evaluate for pneumothorax and residual
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  As before, the heart size is at the upper limit of normal
 variation, but no typical configurational abnormality is seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  The on previous examination identified hazy
 density in the left lung base has disappeared; however, there are new
 parenchymal densities in the mid zone of the left hemithorax and there is a
 marked enlargement of the left hilum indicating a mass lesion.  Presently,
 there is no sign of any significant pleural effusion on either side which
 indicates that the left-sided thoracocentesis must have been successful and
 removed fluid practically totally.  No pneumothorax after the procedure.
 
 Observe that the patient underwent a chest CT five days ago which demonstrated
 a large left sided pulmonary mass impinging on the pulmonary artery.
