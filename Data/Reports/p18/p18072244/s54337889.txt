                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubation, fluid overload on prior CXR 
 // evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  3 AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube still low lying ending approximately 1 cm above the carina
 and could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning. The cardiac
 silhouette is stably enlarged. Patchy bibasilar atelectasis is noted. 
 Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation.
 Accentuation of the thoracic aorta and thinned enlarged main pulmonary artery
 likely accounts for the widened appearance of the left mediastinum and hilum.
 Linear bibasilar atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Accentuation of thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery contours by patient
 rotation likely accounts for the presence of left mediastinal and hilar
 widening. However, a nonrotated radiograph is recommended for short-term
 followup to confirm this impression.
 
 Low lying endotracheal tube as detailed above.
