                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Heart
 size is moderately enlarged.  Dilatation of the main pulmonary arteries is
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension, unchanged.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is demonstrated.  There is likely mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though
 assessment of the right lung apex is limited due to obscuration from soft
 tissue from the patient's neck projecting over this region.  Diffuse sclerosis
 of the osseous structures is compatible with renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
