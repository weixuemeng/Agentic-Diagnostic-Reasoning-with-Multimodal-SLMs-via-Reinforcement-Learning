                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.  Please note that chest
 radiographs are relatively insensitive for detecting pneumocystis pneumonia. 
 If there is strong clinical suspicion for this infection, high-resolution
 chest CT may be considered if warranted clinically.
