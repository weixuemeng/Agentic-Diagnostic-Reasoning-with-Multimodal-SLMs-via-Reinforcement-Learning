                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest tube to waterseal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low
 SVC, as before.  A pigtail catheter is again seen projecting over the lower
 left lung, with reformation of the pigtail compared to the prior radiograph
 from earlier today.  Lung volumes are low, causing crowding of the
 bronchovasculature.  There is increased right lower lung and left mid lung
 atelectasis.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are not significantly
 changed.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions are seen. 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures are re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with increased right lower lung and left mid lung
 atelectasis.
