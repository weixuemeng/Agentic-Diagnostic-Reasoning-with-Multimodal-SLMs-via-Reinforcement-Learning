 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Followup of pneumothorax and hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:56.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left-sided pigtail catheter.  The left lung appears substantially better
 expanded than on the previous films.  Remnant left opacity likely reflects
 re-expansion edema.  A small portion of apical medial pneumothorax is seen
 just above the aortic arch.  There is remaining pleural fluid obliterating the
 left costophrenic sinus.  No evidence of tension.  Unchanged appearance of the
 multiple displaced rib fractures.  Known mild cardiomegaly.  Unchanged
 appearance of the right hemithorax.
