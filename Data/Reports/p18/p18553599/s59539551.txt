                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pedestrian struck, with left first through eighth rib fractures. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back through ___,
 including the most recent study from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low
 SVC, as before.  A pleural catheter continues to end at the left lung base,
 although the distal end of the catheter has lost its previously seen pigtail
 configuration.  Lung volumes remain slightly low.  Dense left retrocardiac
 atelectasis is not significantly changed.  Scattered heterogeneous opacities
 throughout the remainder of the left lung are subsegmental atelectasis,
 possibly related to splinting in the setting of multiple unchanged left-sided
 rib fractures.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  A small left pleural
 effusion is not significantly changed.  There are increased right lower lung
 heterogeneous opacities, likely asymmetric pulmonary edema versus early
 pneumonia.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, increased compared to the prior
 study from ___.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The
 stomach is mildly distended with air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings concerning for early cardiac decompensation, including increased
 mild cardiomegaly, possible asymmetric right lower lobe interstial edema, and
 an unchanged small left pleural effusion. 
 
 2.  Possible early right lower lobe pneumonia, more likely asymmetric edema as
 previously discussed.
 
 2.  Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis, not significantly changed.
 
 2.  Left pleural catheter unchanged in position, although the pigtail is now
 uncoiled.  No definite pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 12:46
 p.m. on the day of the study.
