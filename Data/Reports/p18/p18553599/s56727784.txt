                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of left-sided pneumothorax in a pedestrian struck, now
 with a chest tube to waterseal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 performed six hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest were reviewed and
 compared to the prior studies.  A pigtail catheter within the left chest is
 unchanged in position. Opacity around the left mediastinum and loss of the
 left mediastinal contours is highly concerning for left lung atelectasis
 and/or a large left pneumothorax.  Opacities in the right lung have decreased,
 however, right low lung atelectasis persists.  A right-sided internal jugular
 line ends in the low superior vena cava.  Evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contour is severely limited; however, they appear grossly
 unchanged.  Again left rib fractures are noted.  Subcutaneous air in the left
 hemithorax is slightly decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacity in the left mediastinal region is highly suspicious for
 left lung collapse and/or large left pneumothorax.  
 
 2.  Improvement of right lung aeration and decrease in right lung opacities. 
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to ___ by Dr. ___ at
 11:46 a.m., 10 minutes after the time of discovery.
