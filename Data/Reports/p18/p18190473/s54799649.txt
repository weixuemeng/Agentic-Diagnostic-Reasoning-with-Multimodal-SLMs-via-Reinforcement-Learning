                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right upper quadrant pain and right shoulder pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Minimal
 streaky left base opacity has decreased in the interval, likely
 atelectasis/scarring.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal left base atelectasis appears slightly improved since the
 prior study.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
