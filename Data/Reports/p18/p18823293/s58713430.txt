                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough  // please assess for PNA v. pulmonary
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 01:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, vascular plethora and vascular blurring has
 increased, consistent with increasing CHF.  Increased retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, is similar to
 the prior study.  Patchy opacity at the right lung base is also similar. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a small
 right pleural effusion.  Presence of a small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but grossly unchanged.  Again
 seen is a left-sided pacemaker, with lead tips over the right ventricle.
 
 Probable background COPD.
 
 Linear density to left of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet
 likely represents vascular calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increase in the degree of vascular congestion, compared 1 day earlier,
 consistent with increasing CHF.
 2. Bibasilar opacities, without significant interval change.  This likely
 represents atelectasis, but an early pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult
 to exclude.
