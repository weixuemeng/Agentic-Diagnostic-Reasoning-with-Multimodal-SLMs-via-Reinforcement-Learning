                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with end-stage renal disease, prerenal
 transplant, evaluation code ___, assess for cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP frontal and left lateral view chest examination of ___.  The
 heart size is normal and no configurational abnormality is identified. 
 Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  No mediastinal abnormalities are
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in apical area on frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
 
 When comparison is made with the next previous study of ___.  The
 heart size was considered to be mildly enlarged.  This, however, must have
 been related to the fact that the patient was examined with a frontal AP chest
 view, which causes geometric magnification of the heart silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: Normal chest findings with normal heart size, absence of
 congestion, no pleural effusion and no acute infiltrates.
