                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:36 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with partial bowel obstruction.  Check NG tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Two frontal views of the chest, one centered above the diaphragm, the other
 below both show nasogastric tube looped in lower esophagus, with the tip above
 the level of the aortic knob.  Severe distention of the intestines may be
 responsible in part for diaphragm elevation, with the right hemidiaphragm is
 appreciably higher than the left accounting for marked atelectasis at the base
 of the right lung.  Heart size normal.
