                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Head trauma, intoxicated.  Evaluate for acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of this radiograph.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  There is minimal bilateral lower lung atelectasis.
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is normal in size.  Apparent widening of the
 superior mediastinum relates to mediastinal fat, as seen on subsequent CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
