                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/dementia, afib on Coumadin s/p unwitnessed fall at nursing
 home  // Assess for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ neck CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, nonspecific patchy bibasilar
 opacities have worsened and a new area of consolidation has developed adjacent
 to the aortic knob in the left apical region.  These findings raise the
 possibility of multifocal aspiration and/or developing pneumonia.
