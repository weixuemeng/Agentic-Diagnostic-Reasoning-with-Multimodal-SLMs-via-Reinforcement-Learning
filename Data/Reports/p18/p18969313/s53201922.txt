                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pigtail discontinued  // ?pneumothorax?     
 ?pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest ___ at 17 11 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the right basilar pigtail catheter.  The
 lucency anteriorly on the previous lateral view is less apparent suggesting
 that previously seen tiny pneumothorax has become even smaller.  Streaky
 opacities at the right base persist favoring atelectasis rather than
 infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised. Right subclavian PICC
 line is unchanged. Surgical clips are again seen overlying the left axillary
 region. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A dense
 nodular opacity at the left apex is unchanged consistent with a granuloma.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions.
