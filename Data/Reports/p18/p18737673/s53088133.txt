                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is within the stomach.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases which may reflect areas of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely
 atelectasis.
