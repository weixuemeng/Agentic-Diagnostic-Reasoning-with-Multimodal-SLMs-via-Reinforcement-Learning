                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  There is
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with mild interstitial opacities
 bilaterally suggestive of mild pulmonary edema and increased central venous
 pressure.  Small pleural effusion may be present on the right with blunting of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise without a focal
 consolidation.  Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change in comparison to prior study with evidence of
 chronic congestive heart failure, but no acute intrathoracic process.
