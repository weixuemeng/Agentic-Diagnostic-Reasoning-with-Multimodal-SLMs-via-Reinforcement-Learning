                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain, assess for pericardial effusion or congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Lungs are
 somewhat low in volume with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Within this
 limitation, there may be mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiac size remains stably
 enlarged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Perhaps mild pulmonary edema with assessment limited by low lung
 volumes.
