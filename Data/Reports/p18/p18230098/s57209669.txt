                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of coronary artery disease, CHF,
 presents with chest pain.  Decreased breath sounds on the left.  Question
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 As on prior, there are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen
 bilaterally.  A persistent vague focal opacity in the left upper lung persists
 and is of uncertain etiology.  There is no confluent consolidation.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are seen with blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting mild
 cardiomegaly.  Atherosclerotic calcification is again seen at the aortic arch.
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No evidence of
 frank consolidation.  
 
 2.  Persistent left upper lobe focal opacity, quite vague but a lung nodule is
 a differential consideration.  Chest CT is recommended to evaluate further
 when clinically appropriate.
