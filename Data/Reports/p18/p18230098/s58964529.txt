                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.  Question pneumonia or widening of
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The main pulmonary
 artery contour is again prominent.  The aortic arch appears calcified.  The
 mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  There is increased indistinct
 bilateral perihilar fullness with a widespread peribronchial cuffing,
 interstitial prominence and small nodular opacities suggesting airspace
 disease.  A streaky opacity in the lingula suggests underlying scarring. 
 There is a new small right-sided pleural effusion and a very small left-sided
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate widespread new opacification with a small right-sided
 pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, most suggestive of moderate pulmonary
 edema.
