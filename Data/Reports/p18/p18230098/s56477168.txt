                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with asthma and a month long cough. 
 Is there pneumonia or evidence of pulmonary edema?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  There is persistent cardiac enlargement, already identified on previous
 chest examinations and CT scan of ___.  Previous PA and lateral chest
 examination of the same date confirmed the extensive calcifications in the
 aortic arch and descending aorta as well as coronary arterial calcifications
 close to the root of the aortic valve.  Evidence of pericardial effusion could
 not be established on the plain chest examination.  The pulmonary vasculature
 showed an upper zone redistribution pattern, but no evidence of interstitial
 or alveolar edema.  On the present examination, the cardiac enlargement is
 similar.  There is a slight increase of pulmonary congestion in the form of
 mild blunting of the pleural sinuses laterally and posteriorly, the upper zone
 redistribution pattern persists, but there is no evidence of advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema and no new acute pulmonary infiltrates can be
 identified.
 
 Findings indicate mild degree of chronic CHF resulting in some small amounts
 of pleural effusions.  Consider dehydration therapy unless patient has acute
 cardiac symptoms.
