                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with empyema s/p decortication.  // Eval
 post-pull CXR at ___ today.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Interval removal of a right chest tube. A second chest tube at the right lung
 base may have been pulled back. The side-hole is likely within the right
 hemithorax, however it projects over the right chest wall.
 
 Right-sided pleural and airspace opacities representing empyema, atelectasis
 and postsurgical changes are unchanged.
 
 Small, bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
 
 Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right, large pleural and airspace opacities are consistent with empyema,
 atelectasis and postsurgical changes. The right pleural empyema is likely
 unchanged, perhaps mildly increased from the prior.
 
 2. Interval removal of the right chest tube. A second chest tube at the right
 lung base may have been pulled back. The side-hole is likely within the right
 hemithorax, however it projects over the right chest wall.
 
 3. Small, bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
