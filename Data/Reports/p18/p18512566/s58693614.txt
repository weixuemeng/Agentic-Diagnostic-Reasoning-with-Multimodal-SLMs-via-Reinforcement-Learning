                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Right-sided empyema, parapneumonic effusion status post vats
 decortication. Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact median sternotomy
 wires, two right chest tubes in appropriate positions with tips at the right
 apex and right cardiophrenic angles.
 
 Persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and stable
 heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity. Stable small right pleural effusion.
 No left pleural effusion. Pleural opacities are stable. No pneumothorax. No
 subpulmonic pneumothorax. Heart size is limited in evaluation due to overlying
 parenchymal and pleural abnormality.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No interval change over the past 10 hours. No subpulmonic pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable small right pleural effusion with stable pleural and parenchymal
 opacities most consistent with postsurgical changes.
