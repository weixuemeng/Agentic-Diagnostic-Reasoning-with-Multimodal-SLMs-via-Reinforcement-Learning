 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for
 differences in lung volumes.  Focal area of linear high density is present in
 the right juxtahilar region and may reflect surgical clips from previous wedge
 resection.  In the absence of such surgery, foreign body could produce a
 similar appearance.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with no evidence of pneumonia.
