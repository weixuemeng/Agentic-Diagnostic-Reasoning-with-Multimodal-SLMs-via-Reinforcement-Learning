 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:11 PM
  ETT is only 2.3 cm above carina.  This could be advanced 2-3 cm for more
  optimal positioning.  NGT/OGT ends in distal esophagus and should be advanced
  ___-12 cm so that the sideport is beyond the GE junction.  Cardiomegaly and
  pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement in a ___-year-old woman
 status post PEA arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest from ___ conducted subsequently at 1
 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable supine AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the
 endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating only 2.3 cm above the carina.  The
 orogastric tube terminates in the lower esophagus and should be advanced.  Low
 lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, as well as mild pulmonary edema are also
 noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the CT. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  The endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina.  This could be
 withdrawn 2 to 3 cm for more optimal positioning in the mid trachea.  The
 orogastric tube should be advanced ___ to 12 cm to ensure that the side port is
 beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, likely post-resuscitation.
