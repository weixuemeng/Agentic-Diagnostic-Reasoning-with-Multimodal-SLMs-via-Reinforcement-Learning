                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with severe COPD, hypoxia  // Edema, infiltrate,
 effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged, as seen previously. The aorta
 remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally
 suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 emphysematous changes re- demonstrated.  Mild pulmonary edema is present along
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities within the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis, though infection in the right lung base cannot
 be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized with multilevel mild to moderate
 degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection
 in the right lung base cannot be completely excluded.  Emphysema.
