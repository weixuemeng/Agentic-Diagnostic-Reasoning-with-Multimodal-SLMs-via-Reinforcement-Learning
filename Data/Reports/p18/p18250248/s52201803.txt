                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, status post pacemaker placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate a pacer in position
 in the left anterior axillary position with intact leads along the expected
 course to the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax or
 other complication seen.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly is again seen.  A thin paratracheal
 stripe is visualized.  The opacity to the right of the trachea is consistent
 in appearance with vascular structures in this region and is not of concern. 
 Thoracic scoliosis is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pacer in appropriate position.  Otherwise, unremarkable chest
 radiographs.
