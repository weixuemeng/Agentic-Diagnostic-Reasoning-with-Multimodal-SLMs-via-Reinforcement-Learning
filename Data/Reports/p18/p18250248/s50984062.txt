  1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
  2.  Widened right paratracheal stripe, which could reflect tortuous vessels,
  lymphadenopathy or an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid.  This could be
  further assessed with CT on a non-emergent basis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rapid heart rate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous
 and demonstrates diffuse calcifications, most marked at the aortic knob. 
 Enlarged right paratracheal stripe may reflect tortuous vasculature,
 lymphadenopathy or a large right thyroid goiter.  The lungs are hyperinflated.
 There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no frank pulmonary
 edema is seen.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Thoracic scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Widened right paratracheal stripe, which could reflect tortuous vessels,
 lymphadenopathy or an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid.  This could be
 further assessed with CT on a non-emergent basis.
