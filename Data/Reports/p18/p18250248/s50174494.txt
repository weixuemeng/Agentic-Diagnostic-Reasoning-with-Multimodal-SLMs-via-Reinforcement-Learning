                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobe cavitary lesion with known invasion of T4, T5 and
 worsening right rib and back pain, with leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT
 dated ___, particularly referring to the scout view.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 large cavitating mass in the right upper lobe appears similar to the prior
 scout view.  On this view, particularly well demonstrated on the lateral view,
 is an air-fluid level which is probably unchanged allowing for differences in
 orientation, although judging small differences is accordingly difficult.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Within the limitations of technique, similar appearance of large
 cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe aside with an air-fluid level.  The
 lesion is suspected to be malignant but the possibility of a superimposed
 infectious process could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting;
 tuberculosis as an underlying cause could also be considered in the
 appropriate setting.
