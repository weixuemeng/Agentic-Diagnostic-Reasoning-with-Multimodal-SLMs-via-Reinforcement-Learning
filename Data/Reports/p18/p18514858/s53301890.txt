                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with generalized weakness and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Small left pleural effusion is new with left lower lobe opacity
 possibly reflective of compressive atelectasis or pneumonia.  A small right
 pleural effusion is also likely present.  No pneumothorax is present. An
 azygos lobe is incidentally detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with left lower lobe opacity, possibly
 compressive atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
