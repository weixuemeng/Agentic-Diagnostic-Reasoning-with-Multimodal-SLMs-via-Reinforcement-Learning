                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ovarian cancer relapse, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm and
 blunting of the costophrenic angle.  Findings are consistent with pleural
 effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis at the left base.
 
 Remainder of the study is essentially within normal limits and unchanged from
 the previous study.
