                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with wheezing and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little change in comparison to prior study.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectatic changes are visualized but the lungs are without a focal
 consolidation.  Evidence of prior surgical procedure is again noted with right
 posterior rib resection, left proximal clavicle resection, and multiple
 mediastinal clips associated with the patient's colonic interposition graft. 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
