 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary fibrosis and hypoxia, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Borderline diameter of the azygos vein indicating minimal systemic
 fluid overload.  However, there is no other indicator for pulmonary fluid
 overload, in particular no widening of the mediastinum, no presence of pleural
 effusions and no interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 extensive bilateral interstitial opacities, in the context of known pulmonary
 fibrosis.  No interval appearance of new focal parenchymal opacities.
