                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 A calfified pleural plaque overlies the right diaphragm apex and additional
 plaques are identified bilaterally, findings indicative of prior asbestos
 exposure.  Interstial opacities are present bilaterally which may reflect
 underlying pulmonary fibrosis though no comparison images are available. 
 Alternatively findings could reflect interstial pulmonary edema as there is
 engorgement of the azygous vein, though a normal heart size.  A third
 alternative could be atypical infection.  Consider chest CT for further
 characterization if clinically indicated.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse interstitial opacities likely pulmonary fibrosis (evidence of
 asbestos exposure) with or without interstial pulmonary edema or atypical
 infection.
 
 2.  Dilated azygous vein indicates elevated central venous pressure or volume.
 
 Consider chest CT for further characterization if clinically indicated.
