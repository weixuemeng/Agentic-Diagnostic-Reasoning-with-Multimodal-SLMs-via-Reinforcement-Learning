                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with atrial fibrillation on coumadin status post
 fall, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are diffusely low. Chronic interstitial abnormality is noted
 diffusely, with increased haziness in the lungs bilaterally which could be due
 to atelectasis and low lung volumes, but slight worsening of the patient's
 known chronic interstitial lung disease is not excluded. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified.
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Wedge deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease with increased hazy opacities in
 both lungs, possibly due to atelectasis though worsening of the patient's
 known chronic lung disease cannot be excluded.  No gross focal consolidation.
