                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis s/p multiple liters of fluid now
 having oxygen requirement  // Evaluate for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema  
 Evaluate for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 09:00
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes persist and there are patchy bibasilar opacities with likely
 associated small layering effusions. Findings would favor compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should be considered in the
 correct clinical setting.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the low lung
 volumes.
