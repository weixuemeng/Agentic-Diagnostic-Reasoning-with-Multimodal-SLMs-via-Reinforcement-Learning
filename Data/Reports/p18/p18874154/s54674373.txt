                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with AMS and fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, again demonstrating likely
 moderate cardiomegaly.  There are low lung volumes, with crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  Left mid lung airspace opacity, in addition to
 left retrocardiac opacification, is concerning for developing pneumonia. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  A
 small left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  There is no right
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Left lower lobe airspace opacities may represent developing
 pneumonia.  Consider repeat chest radiograph with and improved inspiratory
 effort.
