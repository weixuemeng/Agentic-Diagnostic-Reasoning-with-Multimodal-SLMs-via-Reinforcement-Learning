                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elevated WBC, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Hazy
 opacities in the lower lungs bilaterally are noted and could represent
 pneumonia.  Due to low lung volumes evaluation is quite limited.  Evaluation
 for pleural effusion is somewhat limited on the lateral view due to obliquity,
 though no large effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size appears stably
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poorly defined opacities in the lower lungs which could represent
 pneumonia.  Limited exam.
