                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, particularly
 at the lung bases.  Given this, on the lateral view, linear posterior lung
 base opacity suggests atelectasis/scarring.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no definite focal consolidation.  No overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis/scarring.  No definite
 focal consolidation.
