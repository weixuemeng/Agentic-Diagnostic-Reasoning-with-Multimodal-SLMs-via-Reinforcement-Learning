 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, lung volumes remain low.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity with
 silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe
 atelectasis or consolidation.  There are and likely no air bronchograms seen
 within the area suggesting this may reflect pneumonia.  Right basilar
 atelectasis.  The trachea remains central, the cardiomediastinal contour is
 unchanged compared to the prior study.

 Low lung volumes again seen.  There is a persistent left lower lobe airspace
 opacity, the appearance remain suspicious for infection although atelectasis
 remains in differential diagnosis.
