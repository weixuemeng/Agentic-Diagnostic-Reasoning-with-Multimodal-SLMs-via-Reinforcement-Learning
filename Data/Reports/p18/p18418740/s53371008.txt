                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 small right pleural effusion.  Blunting of the posterior left costophrenic
 angle may be due to a left-sided pleural effusion as well.  The mediastinum is
 more prominent compared to the prior study, but relatively similar in
 appearance as compared to the scout radiograph from ___ CT, likely
 related to unfolded aorta; however, if there is clinical concern for acute
 aortic/mediastinal process, findings could be further and better evaluated
 with chest CTA.
