 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta is
 moderately tortuous.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is patchy opacification within each costophrenic sulcus
 suggestive of minor atelectasis, as well as left infrahilar retrocardiac
 opacity concerning for a focus of bronchopneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones are probably demineralized.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchovascular opacity in the retrocardiac region concerning for
 bronchopneumonia.
