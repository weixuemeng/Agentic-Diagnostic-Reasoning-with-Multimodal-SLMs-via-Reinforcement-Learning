                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness and shortness of breath for three weeks, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Subtle opacity in
 the lower lungs likely reflects overlapping breast tissue and underpenetrated
 technique.  There is a dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.  The heart is
 mildly prominent, though may be exaggerated by technique.  No convincing signs
 of pneumonia or CHF.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  The imaged
 osseous structures appear intact.  Degenerative changes are again seen in the
 T-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
