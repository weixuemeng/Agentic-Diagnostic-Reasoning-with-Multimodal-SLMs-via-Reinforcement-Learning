  Improved left upper lobe aeration.  Increased hazy opacification of the right
  lung base may represent small right pleural effusion.  And underlying
  atelectasis.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax is not excluded due to
  superimposition of neck structures related to patient positioning.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 Comparison: ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement in extent and severity of the pre-existing left upper lobe and
 right lower lobe opacity.
 
 Otherwise, the lung volumes remain low and there is mild fluid overload as
 well as a borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  Unchanged position of the hemodialysis catheter in the right
 internal jugular vein.
