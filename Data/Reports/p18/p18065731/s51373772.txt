                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post right-sided nephrectomy with
 LND and liver wedge resections, assess for interval findings and for left
 upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding portable chest examination of ___.  The heart size
 remains unchanged and is mildly enlarged.  There is relative left ventricular
 contour prominence.  Presently, no evidence of significant pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Thoracic aorta unchanged without local contour abnormalities. 
 The previously described right-sided internal jugular approach double-lumen
 line remains in unchanged position terminating in the mid portion of the right
 SVC at the level of the carina.  The previously identified and suspected
 pulmonary infiltrates in the left upper lobe area have further regressed and
 are practically resolved.  There remains a small detectable fluid blunting of
 the right lateral pleural sinus and the lateral view discloses small amounts
 of fluid blunting the posterior pleural sinuses in the lower posterior region.
 No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen and no pneumothorax is
 present.  When comparison is extended to the PA and lateral chest examination
 of ___, the amount of pleural effusions in the posterior sinuses
 remains stable and unchanged.
