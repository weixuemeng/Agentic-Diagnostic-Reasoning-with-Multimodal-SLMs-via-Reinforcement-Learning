 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:32 PM
  Right chest tube with tip overlying periphery of the left upper lung zone.  No
  definite pneumothorax.  Multiple lines are overlying the chest, including a
  thin discontinous line overlying the left medial hemithorax.  Per discussion
  with Dr. ___, ___ patient has no central lines, so these are likely outside
  of the patient.  The lung volumes are low.  Left basilar conolidation is
  likely atelectasis, although a developing consolidation is a consideration,
  and attention on follow-up exams is recommended.  Surgical clips are noted in
  the upper abdomen.  A lucency overlying the left upper abdomen may be the
  stomach bubble or some free intraperitoneal air, which is not unexpected
  post-operatively.
