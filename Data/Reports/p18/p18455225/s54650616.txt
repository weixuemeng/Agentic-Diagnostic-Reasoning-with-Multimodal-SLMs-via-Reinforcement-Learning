 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  The parenchymal opacities, right more than
 left, are unchanged in extent and distribution.  They are likely caused by a
 combination of pneumonia and pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly with
 retrocardiac atelectasis persists.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
