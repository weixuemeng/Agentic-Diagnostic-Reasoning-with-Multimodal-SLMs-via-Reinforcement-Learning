                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, assess ET tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5.9 cm above the
 carina.  The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.  Layering bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted with lower lobe consolidation, likely atelectasis,
 though cannot exclude pneumonia/aspiration.  The upper lungs appear well
 aerated.  Heart size is difficult to assess.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  There is a deformity of the left distal clavicle, which is
 incompletely characterized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tubes positioned appropriately.  Bilateral effusions with lower
 lobe atelectasis, cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration.  Left distal
 clavicular deformity.  Recommend dedicated views of the left shoulder to
 further assess.
