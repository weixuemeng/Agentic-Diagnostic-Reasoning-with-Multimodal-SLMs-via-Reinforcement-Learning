                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, now worsening dyspnea.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 15:51 p.m.
 
 A right PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Though there is the appearance of a curvilinear density at the left lung apex,
 this probably reflects some pleural thickening at the apex.
 
 There has been interval worsening of collapse/consolidation at the left base,
 with increased retrocardiac density, interval obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, and slight increase in the degree of patchy opacity at the left
 base laterally extending into the cardiophrenic angle.  
 
 Again seen is hazy opacity in the right mid and lower zones, which may reflect
 some layering pleural fluid as well as underlying right base collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to prior.   
 Upper zone re-distribution, without overt CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is enlarged but stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with new
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and increase in the degree of opacity
 seen behind the heart and at the lateral base.
 
 2.  Opacity in the right base appears similar to prior, probably reflecting
 some layering pleural fluid as well as underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
