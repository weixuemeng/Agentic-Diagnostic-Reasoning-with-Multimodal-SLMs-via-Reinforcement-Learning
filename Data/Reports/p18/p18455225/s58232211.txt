                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Treatment for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  There may be some improvement in the degree of pleural
 effusion, more prominent on the right, though some of this may merely reflect
 difference in patient positioning.  Mild bibasilar atelectatic changes are
 again seen.
 
 The left IJ catheter has been removed.
