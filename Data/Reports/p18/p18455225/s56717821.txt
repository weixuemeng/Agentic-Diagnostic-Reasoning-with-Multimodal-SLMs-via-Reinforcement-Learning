                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increasing white blood cell count, treatment for
 pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction or proximal right atrium
 and probably should be pulled back for approximately 2 cm to secure its
 position above the cavoatrial junction.  Right pleural effusion is unchanged
 as well as bibasal consolidations.  There is no pneumothorax.
