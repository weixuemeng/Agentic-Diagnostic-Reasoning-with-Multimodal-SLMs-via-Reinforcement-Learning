 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the the left. Given this, there is right
 infrahilar opacity which may be accentuated by patient rotation but underlying
 consolidation due to infection or aspiration not excluded. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal
 contours are stable. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen.
 Surgical clips are again noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient rotated.  Right infrahilar opacity may be exaggerated by patient
 rotation but underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration not
 excluded.  Recommend followup to resolution. Consider repeat radiograph with
 more optimal patient positioning there is able.
