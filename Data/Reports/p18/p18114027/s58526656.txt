                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  The right IJ catheter has been removed and the nasogastric tube
 again extends to the upper stomach.
 
 There is opacification at the bases most likely reflecting small right
 effusion and bilateral atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
