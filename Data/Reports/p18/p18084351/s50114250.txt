                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PORTABLE EXAM, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged with a globular
 configuration.  This could reflect cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild edema.  Additionally, a
 more confluent opacity is present in the left retrocardiac region and is
 difficult to assess on this single portable projection.  Note is also made of
 moderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm and small left pleural effusion. When
 the patient's condition allows, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs are
 recommended for more complete evaluation.
