 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pleural effusions, evaluation for interval change.

 interstitial lung edema.  However, there is still some remnant mild
 interstitial lung edema on the current image.  Atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.  Minimal plate-like atelectasis on the left in the perihilar regions. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
