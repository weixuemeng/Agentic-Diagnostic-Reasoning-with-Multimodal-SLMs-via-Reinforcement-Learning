                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of pleural effusions, now with
 posterior back pain for two days.  Evaluate pleural effusions or evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently on ___ and
 ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large opacity in the left mid lung, better assessed on Torso CT
 ___, has grown since previous radiograph two weeks ago. There is also
 greater heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base where there was a similar
 peripheral lung and pleural lesion. First consideration, to exclude multifocal
 lung infection, is unlikely given clinical situation described to me by
 medical house officer. It would appear to be caused by aggressive multifocal
 malignancy, either lung or metastatic breast cancer, per provided history.
 Bilateral diffuse interstitial abnormality has worsened from prior, probably
 edema, perhaps on the background of interstitial lung disease/fibrosis. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small, but slightly larger.  Heart is not
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progressive multifocal malignancy in lung. Worsened mild edema.
 Findings, including pericardial effusion present on ___ CTA discussed
 with ___ at 9AM.
