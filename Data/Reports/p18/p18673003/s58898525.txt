                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusions status post thoracentesis, rule out
 pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable single frontal chest radiograph performed with the patient in upright
 position. 
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The right pleural effusion has appropriately
 decreased in size following thoracentesis.  The left pleural effusion is
 stable in size.  A consolidation seen in the left lung zone corresponds to the
 mass that is better seen on the CT scan performed 1 day prior.  There is
 severe bilateral interstitial edema.  The heart size is in the upper limit of
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval decrease in right pleural effusion without pneumothorax.  Severe
 bilateral interstitial edema.
