                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pericardiectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 A small right apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent.  Cardiac size and
 mediastinal widening is grossly unchanged allowing the difference in position
 of the patient.  The mediastinal and bibasilar chest tubes are in place.  Now
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved.  Right lower lobe atelectasis
 has worsened.  Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Left axillary
 venous stent is again noted.  Left perihilar atelectasis is unchanged. 
 Sternal wires are aligned.
