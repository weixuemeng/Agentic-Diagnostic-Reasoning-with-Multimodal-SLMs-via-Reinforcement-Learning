                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of HIV with cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There are stents in the left axillary/subclavian region.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small though slightly larger on the
 left, are new from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, with persistent mild
 cardiomegaly, but no pulmonary edema.
 
 On the lateral view, there is a 1.5-cm nodule projecting anterior to a lower
 thoracic vertebral body within the lower lobes, side indeterminate.  This was
 not apparent on prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No apparent pneumonia.  This could
 reflect underlying pulmonary embolus in the proper clinical setting, and this
 should be excluded if clinically indicated.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema, unchanged.
 3.  1.4-cm nodular density projecting over the lower lobes in the lateral
 view.  Nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 1:15 p.m. on ___
 by Dr. ___ by phone.
