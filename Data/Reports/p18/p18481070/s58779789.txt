                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T2/3 mass, ?OM, s/p OR with O2 requirement
 // eval pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post recent thoracic spine surgery with immediate
 postoperative changes, not fully evaluated by conventional chest radiographs.
 
 Heart is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema.  A wedge-shaped opacity with parenchymal and pleural
 components in the periphery of the left lung apex corresponds to a site with a
 fiducial seed on the prior CT, possibly representing a site of a treated
 cancer.  Left retrocardiac opacification is new as well as a patchy area of
 opacification in the right infrahilar region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Nonspecific bibasilar opacities are
 potentially due to atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting, and
 aspiration is an additional consideration in this context.
 
 Post treatment changes at the left apex and in the upper thoracic spine are
 not well evaluated on this chest radiograph exam.
