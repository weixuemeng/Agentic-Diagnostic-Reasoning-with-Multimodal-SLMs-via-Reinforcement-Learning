                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative for aortic valve replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 somewhat more prominent with left ventricular configuration and there is
 continued tortuosity of the aorta.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, without acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  Substantial loss of height of a mid dorsal
 vertebra is again noted in a patient with generalized osteopenia of the bony
 elements.
