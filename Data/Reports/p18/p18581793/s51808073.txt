                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  My initial review of more than a dozen of this patient's prior chest
 radiographs in order to interpret the ___ study showed what appeared to be
 a persistent ground-glass/consolidative abnormality in the right lower lobe
 since ___.  Only one chest radiograph, taken ___,
 which I failed to review initially and am looking at now shows complete
 clearing of the right lower lobe abnormality.  Therefore the finding is
 explained by recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, favoring the right lower
 lobe, and NOT alveolar form of adenocarcinoma which would otherwise be a
 reasonable diagnosis.  There is no indication to pursue a diagnosis of lung
 cancer.
 
 There is still pronounced consolidation at the base of the left lung, which
 progressed from ___ through ___ and could be either atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 
 I explained this in detail to the pulmonology consultant, Dr. ___ who
 ___ inform other members of the care team of this change in my diagnosis.

 ADDENDUM  I was just made aware of an addendum by Dr. ___  ___ his previous
 reading, indicating that there is no reason for further evaluation of this
 patient for underlying malignancy.  I concur and have spoken to the resident
 taking care of the patient about this.
