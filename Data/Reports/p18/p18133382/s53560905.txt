                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CHF, jugulovenous distention, crackles
 on the right, assess pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  A dual-lead pacer
 is seen with its pacer pack overlying the left axilla and lead tips extending
 to the level of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  However, in the right
 upper lobe, there is slight coarsening of the initial markings and mild
 distortion, which likely indicates the presence of focal area of scarring.  No
 sizable effusion, though tiny effusions cannot be excluded.  Mild interstitial
 edema is difficult to exclude.
 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly without overt edema.  Probable scarring in
 the right upper lung.  Possible tiny effusions.
