                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with malignancy and abdominal pain, question new
 focal opacity.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 421.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains stably enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although a pericardial effusion should also be considered.  A left-sided pacer
 remains in place.  There has been interval development of a bilateral diffuse
 airspace and interstitial process most likely representing a
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  A diffuse infectious process would be
 less likely.  No large effusions are appreciated.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Calcification of the aortic knob consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  Focal opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
