                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hepatic and renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and this study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate unchanged position of
 pacemaker leads, terminating in the right atrium and the right ventricle. 
 Within the right lung, multiple nodular and branching opacities are
 identified, which could represent a component of bronchiectasis, although not
 present previously, and also could be multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Additionally, there is mild prominence of the right hilar
 structures, possibly representing lymphadenopathy or vascular structures. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple nodular and branching opacities in the right lung could
 represent multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, or a
 component of newly-developed bronchiectasis.  Right hilar prominence is
 non-specific but may due to lymphadenopathy or vascular structures.  If
 further characteriztion is required, a contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
