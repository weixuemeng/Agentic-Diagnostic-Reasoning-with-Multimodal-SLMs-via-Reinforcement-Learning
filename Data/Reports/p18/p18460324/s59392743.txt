                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stroke and atrial fibrillation. 
 Followup chest film to evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 20:33.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial
 effusion.  There is persistent mild pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax
 appreciated.  Patchy bibasilar opacity is likely related to the pulmonary
 edema, although atelectasis or an infectious process should also be
 considered.  No large effusions.
