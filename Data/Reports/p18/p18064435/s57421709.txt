 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and a new interstitial edema.  A
 more confluent area of opacity at the right lung base has partially cleared
 and probably represents resolving atelectasis.  Adjacent small-to-moderate
 right pleural effusion is again demonstrated.
