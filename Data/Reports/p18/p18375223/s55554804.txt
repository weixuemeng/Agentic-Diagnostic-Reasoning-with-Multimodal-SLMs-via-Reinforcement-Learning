 mild rightward mediastinal shift.  There is associated left basilar
 atelectasis.  Apart from streaky right basilar atelectasis, the right lung is
 clear.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel
 mild degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.

 Large left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
