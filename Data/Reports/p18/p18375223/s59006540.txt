                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with known pleural effusion, here w/ dizziness  //
 eval pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the most recent study, there has been increase in size of the
 left pleural effusion, with considerable new increased density at the left
 lung apex, which may represent loculated pleural fluid.  Some residual lucency
 is seen at the uppermost left lung apex raising the question of a residual
 hydro pneumothorax versus a small area of residual aeration at the lung apex. 
 There is likely underlying compressive atelectasis the left lung.  Again seen
 is a left chest tube coursing along the base and medial side of the left lung.
 
 Vascular congestion is similar to the prior examinations.  Focal consolidation
 is not excluded.
 
 Incidental note is made of degenerative change at the left shoulder, with
 focal hydroxyapatite/calcific tendonitis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left pleural effusion, possibly loculated.  Likely underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  Focal consolidation may be underlying.  A small
 pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  If clinically indicated, CT scan can be
 obtained for more detailed evaluation.
 
 The right lung remains grossly clear, with minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angle but no gross effusion.
