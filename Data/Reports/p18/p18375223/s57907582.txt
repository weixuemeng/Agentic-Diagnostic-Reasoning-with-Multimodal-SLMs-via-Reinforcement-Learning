                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion s/p TPC placement  //
 residual pleural effusion on left
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.
 
 Small layering left pleural effusion appears similar to the prior study in ___.  Adjacent parenchymal consolidation is likely atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right lung
 is otherwise essentially clear.  Previously noted left apical pneumothorax is
 not appreciated.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Bilateral
 glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis, more pronounced on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Little change in layering left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.
