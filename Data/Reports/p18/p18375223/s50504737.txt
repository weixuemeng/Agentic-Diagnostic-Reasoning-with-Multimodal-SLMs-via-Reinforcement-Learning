                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of difficulty
 swallowing, confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to pleural thickening or
 trace pleural effusion. There are relatively low lung volumes.  Given this, no
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Degenerative changes are seen along the
 spine.  There are also degenerative changes at bilateral acromioclavicular and
 shoulder joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to a
 trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
