                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, hypertension, diverticulosis, admitted with hematochezia. 
 Being diuresed for CHF, now with orthostasis.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is diffuse parenchymal scarring, also compatible with COPD,
 including some pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex and some
 focal opacity in the right lung laterally.  The hila are prominent, with a
 tapered appearance, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
 
 There is patchy retrocardiac opacity consistent with some left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, improved compared with ___. There is a
 small right effusion, new compared with ___. There is also a small amount
 of pleural fluid or thickening in the left costophrenic angle.  
 
 There is possible minimal upper zone redistribution. Allowing for background
 parenchymal scarring, doubt overt CHF. 
 
 Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Advanced COPD with probable pulmonary hypertension.
 
 2) LLL collapse/consolidation, improved compared with ___.
 
 3) Small bilateral effusions, new on the right.
 
 4) Possible minimal upper zone redistribution, doubt overt CHF.
