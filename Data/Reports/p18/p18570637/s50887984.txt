                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated as on prior.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles suggests small effusions as on prior.  Coarse interstitial
 markings are seen throughout, likely due to chronic underlying lung disease. 
 Calcified granuloma projects over the right upper lung medially, unchanged. 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of chronic underlying lung disease. 
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.  No superimposed acute
 consolidation.
