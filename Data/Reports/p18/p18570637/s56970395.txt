  Hyperinflation with chronic underlying lung disease.  Possible trace residual
  pleural effusions.  Rounded opacity projecting over the right upper lung,
  potentially focal region of infection.  Given patient's degree of underlying
  parenchymal disease, however, followup is suggested to document resolution of
  this finding to exclude underlying mass lesion

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with asymptomatic hyperkalemia.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 with coarse increased interstitial markings compatible with chronic underlying
 lung disease.  There is new focal consolidation in the right upper lung, not
 seen on previous exam on the frontal view.  There is trace blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles which may be small residual pleural effusions,
 improved from prior.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation with chronic underlying lung disease.  Possible
 trace residual pleural effusions.  Rounded opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung, potentially focal region of infection.  Given patient's degree of
 underlying parenchymal disease, however, followup is suggested to document
 resolution of this finding to exclude underlying mass lesion.
