                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fatigue.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of
 consolidation.  There is no evidence of large effusion.  Blunting of the
 lateral costophrenic angles may be due to underlying pleural thickening or
 scarring.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.  The aorta is
 markedly tortuous, as on prior.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
