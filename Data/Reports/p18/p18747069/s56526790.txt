                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:16 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old female with diabetes, COPD, left renal tumor, partial
 left nephrectomy complicated by persistent hypotension and ARDS.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema had improved between ___ and ___.  Today, there is
 worsening of both the interstitial component of edema in the upper lungs and
 the confluent consolidation at both lung bases, as well as an increase in
 pleural effusion, at least moderate in size.  Whether this reflects worsening
 of the edema, cardiac or otherwise, or is just a reflection of the end of
 positive pressure ventilator support following extubation is radiographically
 indeterminate.  It should be noted that the heart has never been enlarged. 
 Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
