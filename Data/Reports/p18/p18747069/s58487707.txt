   New pigtail drain overlying the lower right hemithorax.  Decrease in right
  pleural effusion.  Stable left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Mild
  interval improvement in interstitial/alveolar opacities, likely representing
  improved edema.  Stable emphysematous changes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:28 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman after nephrectomy with bilateral pleural
 effusions, had a right thoracentesis.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5am:
 
 A small bore drainage catheter projects over the right diaphragmatic region,
 but cannot be localized on this single frontal view.  Generalized edema has
 improved slightly, particularly in the right lower lung since earlier in the
 day, and there is less pleural fluid on that side.  I would strongly recommend
 conventional chest radiographs if feasible to look for subtle manifestations
 of pneumothorax.  Moderate left pleural effusion is stable or slightly larger
 since 5 a.m.  Heart size is normal.  Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
