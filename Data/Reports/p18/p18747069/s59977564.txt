  Ongoing mild pulmonary edema. Asymmetric opacity in left lung apex may be due
  to developing infection or asymmetric edema. Close attention to this area on
  follow-up recommended.  No other change from prior. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with pulmonary edema, new oxygen requirement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.  Asymmetric opacity in the left apex
 suggests developing infection.  The lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have
 increased consistent with increasing atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged.
