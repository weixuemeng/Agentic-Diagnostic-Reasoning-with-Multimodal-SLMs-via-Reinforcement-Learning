                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizures and cirrhosis intubated  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  There is a left IJ, which
 terminates in the mid SVC.  There is an NG tube which courses below the
 diaphragm, however the tip is not visualized on this image.
 
 The fluid in the minor fissure has resolved.  There is now bilateral diffuse
 airspace and interstitial opacities.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube, left IJ, and NG tube in appropriate positioning.
 2.  Bilateral diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities, which likely
 represents pulmonary edema rather than multifocal pneumonia.
