                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Followup lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 The lung nodule questioned in the right middle lobe on the chest radiograph of
 ___ which corresponds to the location of pneumonia on ___
 is barely visible today.  I doubt there is a clinically significant lung
 lesion in this location, but given the patient's age, one more examination in
 another six months would be reasonable followup.  Hyperinflation suggests some
 emphysema, but this is otherwise a normal radiographic examination of the
 chest with normal heart size, no pleural abnormality or evidence of any
 central adenopathy.
