 AP CHEST, 9:38 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Renal cell carcinoma.  Worsening tachypnea and hypoxia.

 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is new.  Moderate cardiomegaly is worsened
 and there is now a new small pleural effusion.  Extensive pulmonary metastasis
 is only partially visible.  Interval increase in mediastinal caliber is
 probably due to venous engorgement, baseline widening due to extensive fat
 deposition and some lymph node enlargement.  Right jugular line ends low in
 the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
