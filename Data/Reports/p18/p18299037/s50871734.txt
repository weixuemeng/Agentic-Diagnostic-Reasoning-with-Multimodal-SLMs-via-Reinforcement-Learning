                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia,
 clinical concern for acute thoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Again seen are two metastatic pulmonary nodules
 measuring 2.9 x 2.6 cm in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, and 2 x
 1.4 cm at the junction of the left upper lobe and lingula, within the inferior
 portion of the left major fissure.  Other known pulmonary metastases are not
 well visualized by radiography.  There is increased prominence of the hila and
 upper mediastinum, which may represent new lymphadenopathy.
 
 Increased discoid atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe, without focal
 consolidation.  There is no pulmonary venous congestion or edema.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible new intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, which could be better
 evaluated by CT if clinically warranted.
 
 2.  Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 3.  Unchanged pulmonary metastases.
