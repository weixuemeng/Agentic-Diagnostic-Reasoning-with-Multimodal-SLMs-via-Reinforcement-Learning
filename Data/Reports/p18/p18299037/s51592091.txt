                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar haze likely reflects known pleural effusion; underlying
 bibasilar densities are non-specific and may represent atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  Lung volumes are low. There is mild
 interstitial edema.  Lobular mediastinal densities likely correspond to
 lymphadenopathy seen on prior CT and appears progressed.  Heart size is top
 normal.  No pneumothorax is detected on this view.  Large left upper lobe
 nodular opacity is again noted and likely corresponds to known metastatic
 mass.  Right-sided hemodialysis catheter is seen with tip possibly terminating
 within the right atrium, although not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar haze, likely corresponding to pleural
 effusions seen on concomitant chest CT.  Underlying densities may represent
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  Discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ by phone at 3:20 a.m. on ___. 
 2. Mild interstitial edema.   
 3. Interval progression of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
