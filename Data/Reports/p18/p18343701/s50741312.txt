 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // ? lung fields
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___

 left pleural effusion an leftward mediastinal shift suggests this is largely
 lobar collapse, a common source of hypoxia in elderly patients. Small right
 pleural effusion is stable.  Upper lungs are clear. Heart is mildly enlarged,
 but there is no pulmonary edema. Right internal jugular catheter ends in the
 upper SVC. Left internal jugular sheath remains after removal of the Swan-Ganz
 catheter. No pneumothorax.
