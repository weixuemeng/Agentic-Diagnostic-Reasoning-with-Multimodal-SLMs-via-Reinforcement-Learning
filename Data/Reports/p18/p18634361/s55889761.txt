                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with emphysema, status post pneumonia on the
 left side, now worsening cough.  Evaluation for left lung opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs the chest from ___. 
 This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The previously
 seen opacification in the left lower lung persists on the study, although
 there are multiple air-fluid levels which are more prominent than they were
 previously and could represent a loculated fluid collection.  There is stable
 appearance of multiple pleural plaques.  There is no significant pulmonary
 edema, pneumothorax or new area of consolidation.  Pacemaker leads is in
 unchanged position compared to prior study.  There is pronounced kyphotic
 curvature of the thoracic spine with multilevel compression deformities as
 seen on prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation is again seen and multiple
 air-fluid levels suggest loculated fluid collection.  Otherwise, not
 significantly changed since the prior radiograph.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ ___ at
 12 o'clock, five minutes after the finding was discovered.
