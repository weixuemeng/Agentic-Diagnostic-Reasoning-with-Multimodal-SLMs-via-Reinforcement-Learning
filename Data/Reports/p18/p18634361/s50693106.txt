 WET READ: ___ ___ 4:46 PM
  Increased focal opacity near a fiducial marked in the left lower lobe;
  differential considerations include radiation pneumonitis or potentially
  infection in the appropriate setting, superimposed on known malignancy in the
  area.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as more recent chest
 CT studies from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle. 
 There is a fiducial marker projecting over an area of opacification in the
 left lower lobe that includes an irregular mass-like component as well as
 substantial underlying pleural thickening along the left lower lateral chest. 
 The most recent comparison is the frontal scout view from the CT of ___; there is now greater opacification in the vicinity of the fiducial marker
 than seen earlier.  The lateral view also suggests peripheral consolidation in
 the same area of the left lower lobe.  Calcified pleural plaques are present. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Mild-to-moderate compression deformities of the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine appear similar.  The bones are demineralized.  A
 chronic-appearing right posterolateral fifth rib fracture appears unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification near a fiducial marker in the left lower
 lobe; differential considerations include radiation pneumonitis or
 post-obstructive infection in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 on known malignancy.
