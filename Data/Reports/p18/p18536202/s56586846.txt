                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening obstructive respiratory pattern, decreased breath sounds
 on the right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 A single-lead pacemaker is present, the lead tip is poorly visualized due to
 underpenetration, but likely overlies the right ventricle.  Tubing overlies
 the superior mediastinum, not traced below the level of the aortic knob, and
 therefore not fully evaluated, but unchanged compared with ___ 14:55 p.m. 
 
 
 There is hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  There is upper zone
 redistribution.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, similar to prior.  No frank
 consolidation is identified.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) No significant change compared with ___ at 14:55 p.m.
 2) COPD and upper zone redistribution, with bibasilar atelectasis.  
 3) Tubing over superior mediastinum, not fully visualized.
