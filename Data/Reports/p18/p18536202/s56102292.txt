                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.  Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Left
 lower lobe atelectases are new.  Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe
 could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard position.  If any,
 there is a small right pleural effusion.
