                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New nasogastric tube placement, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The device can be followed along the proximal and mid third
 of the esophagus and not clearly visualized beyond that.  Additional upper
 abdominal views should be obtained to confirm or exclude correct tube
 position.
 
 No other relevant changes.  Minimal fluid overload, mild cardiomegaly, left
 pectoral pacemaker.
