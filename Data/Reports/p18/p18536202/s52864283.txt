                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for aspiration event.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip lying approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  An NG
 tube is present, tip extending distally, traced to the level of lower
 mediastinum - it may extend below this but is obscured by underpenetration. 
 Right IJ central line tip lies at SVC/RA junction. Again noted is a
 single-lead pacemaker. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Compared with ___ at 12:12 p.m., the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Again seen is an elevated hemidiaphragm with some increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There has been partial interval clearing of left base
 opacities.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular
 blurring.  There is atelectasis at the right base.  No gross right effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Partial interval clearing of opacities at the left base.  
 2) Probable mild CHF.
