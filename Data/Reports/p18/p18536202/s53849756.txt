                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ with previous study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Rapid worsening of bibasilar opacities since the recent study of
 earlier the same date favors atelectasis and/or aspiration over an infectious
 pneumonia.  Endotracheal tube has been exchanged for a tracheostomy tube in
 standard position with no radiographic evidence of complications.  Otherwise,
 no relevant changes since recent study.
