 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Intubated.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary mediastinal vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly persist
 indicating mild cardiac decompensation.  New small opacity in the left lower
 lung could be atelectasis, since left hemidiaphragm is intermittently
 elevated.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.  An enteric tube is traceable only as far as the mid to
 low esophagus, previously it passed into the stomach.  Transvenous pacer lead
 tip projects over the anticipated location of the right ventricular apex. 
 Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
