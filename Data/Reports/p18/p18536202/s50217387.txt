  A portion of the nasogastric tube is difficult to see beyond the low
  esophagus, but a similar tube is seen below the diaphragm with tip out of
  view, which is thought to most likely represent continuation of the
  nasogastric tube.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___ hours.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___ hours.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at ___ hours is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac
 enlargement.  There are prominent perihilar vessels and indistinct pulmonary
 vascularity, which likely reflects a combination of fluid overload and
 pulmonary edema.  Possible layering bilateral effusions.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm, likely in satisfactory position.  The lead
 of a left-sided pacer is incompletely visualized but appears to be terminating
 in the expected location of the right ventricle.  No pneumothorax.
