                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration, interval progression of multifocal pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending through the lower mediastinum, off the film. 
 Left-sided single-lead pacemaker noted.  The distal tip of the lead extends
 off the film. 
 
 Compared with ___, there may be slightly more pleural fluid at the left
 base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm and minimal patchy opacity at the right base. 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged but stable.  
 
 A nodular opacity measuring 7.4 mm overlies the right fourth rib laterally. 
 This lesion is also seen on a ___ radiograph, where it overlies the lung
 rather than bone, and could represent a pulmonary nodule.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1) Possible slight increase in left base pleural fluid.  Otherwise, no
 significant change.
 
 2) Possible pulmonary nodule right upper zone.  Further assessment with chest
 CT when the patient is stable is recommended.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 2:___ pm on the day of th
 exam (___, phone).
