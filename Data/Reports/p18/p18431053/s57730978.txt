                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bibasilar crackles, evidence of heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 826.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the atelectatic changes at
 the left lung base are substantially improved.  However, the presence of a
 minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, based on the minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged.  Low lung volumes, no pulmonary edema.
