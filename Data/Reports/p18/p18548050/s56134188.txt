                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___ AT 2:08 A.M.
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of Swan-Ganz catheter projects in left retrocardiac region
 within the expected distal segmental branch of the left lower lobe pulmonary
 artery.  Dr. ___ has been notified of this finding by telephone at 8:15
 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.  Tip of the endotracheal tube
 is in standard position terminating about 5 cm above the carina.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement and
 asymmetrical perihilar edema, worse on the right than the left.  A more
 confluent opacity in the right lower lobe could reflect dependent pulmonary
 edema or a secondary process such as infection.  Moderate layering right
 pleural effusion is also noted.  Finally, widening of the mediastinum is
 present above the level of the aortic arch.  Although possibly due to venous
 distention in the setting of congestive heart failure, the possibility of
 lymphadenopathy or mass is not excluded in the absence of older radiographs
 for comparison.  With this in mind, careful followup radiographs are
 recommended following appropriate treatment for congestive heart failure prior
 to discharge.  This finding was also communicated to Dr. ___ at the time
 of the above communication.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Distal position of Swan-Ganz catheter.  Please see documentation of
 communication above.
 2.  Probable asymmetrical pulmonary edema but follow up radiographs would be
 helpful to exclude a secondary superimposed process in the right lower lobe.
 At that time, the mediastinal width may also be reassessed.
