                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a new patchy right mid lung opacity view suggesting pneumonia.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a curvilinear
 lucency projecting over the right lower lung that is suspected to reflect the
 minor fissure, although the less likely possibility of free air could be
 considered.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy but extensive new right lung opacity worrisome for
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Although probably an artifact, repeat radiographs
 are recommended to exclude the unlikely possibility of free air associated
 with a curvilinear lucency projecting along the right lower hemithorax.  
 
 The suggestion was discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 7:00 very shortly
 after interpretation.
