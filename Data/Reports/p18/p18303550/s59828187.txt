  1. Interval reaccumulation of a large left pleural effusion with associated
  compressive atelectasis of the entire left lower lobe.
  2. Persistent opacities in the partially aerated left upper lobe may represent
  pneumonia, metastatic disease, or pulmonary hemorrhage, similar in appearance
  to the prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough and fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior radiograph there has been interval
 reaccumulation of a large left pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis of the entire left lower lobe.  A small amount of aeration is
 still seen within the left upper lobe with persistent left upper lobe
 opacities similar to the prior study, which may represent pneumonia,
 metastatic disease, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  A small amount of air laterally
 may represent persistent aeration in the left upper lobe or a small locule of
 air within the effusion.  There is a trace right pleural effusion.  The right
 lung is otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the
 large left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval reaccumulation of a large left pleural effusion with associated
 compressive atelectasis of the entire left lower lobe.
 2. Persistent opacities in the partially aerated left upper lobe may represent
 pneumonia, metastatic disease, or pulmonary hemorrhage, similar in appearance
 to the prior study.
