                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic renal cell Ca with Left pleural
 effusion s/p pleurex  // eval for interval changeplease do at ___     eval
 for interval changeplease do at ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 18:05.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left perihilar consolidation which developed following pleural drainage on
 ___ has not cleared.  This is later then usual for re-expansion pulmonary
 edema and raises concern for pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Greater
 opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis, particularly
 in light of increasing small to moderate right pleural effusion, but if the
 left side is pneumonia, the right lower lobe could be bronchogenic
 dissemination.  Residual left pleural volume is probably moderate and the
 appearance of the lung base could be explained by atelectasis alone.
