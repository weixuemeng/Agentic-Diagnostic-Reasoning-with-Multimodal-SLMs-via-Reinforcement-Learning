                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left malignant effusion  // interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, consistent with
 massive pleural effusion.  Also again seen is rightward shift of the
 mediastinum, similar to the prior study.  The right lung remains grossly
 clear.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with small
 right effusion is again noted.  There may be subtle atelectasis at the right
 base is well.  No CHF.  Again noted are surgical clips overlying the lower
 left mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacity at the right lung base may represent some early atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.Complete opacification of left
 hemi thorax in rightward shift of the mediastinum are similar to the chest
 x-ray from 1 day earlier.
