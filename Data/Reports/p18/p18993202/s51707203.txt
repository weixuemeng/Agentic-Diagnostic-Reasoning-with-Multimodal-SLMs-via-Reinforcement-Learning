                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 subtle patchy right base opacity which could be due to atelectasis, although
 underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy right base opacity could be due to atelectasis;
 however, underlying infection in the appropriate clinical setting is not
 excluded.
