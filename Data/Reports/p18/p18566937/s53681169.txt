                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive right-sided pleural opacification appears similar to the
 prior radiograph allowing for difference between the exams, and corresponds to
 a combination of loculated pleural fluid and soft tissue pleural nodules on CT
 in this patient with known metastatic disease.  Adjacent atelectasis within
 the right lung involving the middle and lower lobes to a greater degree than
 the upper lobe appear unchanged as well.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 is present as well as a possible small left pleural effusion.  Known small
 nodules in the left lung are seen to better detail on recent chest CT of
 ___.  No definite superimposed pneumonia is present, but subtle
 pneumonia would be difficult to detect given the extensive pleural and
 parenchymal disease in the right lung.
