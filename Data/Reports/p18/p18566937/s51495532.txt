                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue, elevated WBC, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  This patient is
 known to have metastatic renal cell cancer with extensive involvement of the
 right hemithorax.  There is extensive pleural nodularity as seen on prior CT,
 involving the right lung.  Also noted is opacity within the right lower lobe,
 which could represent compressive atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Small
 effusion is also likely present on the right.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Extensive right pleural nodularity compatible with known metastatic RCC. 
 Slight increase in airspace opacity in the right lower lobe could represent
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
