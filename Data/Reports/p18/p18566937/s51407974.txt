 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell cancer, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 pre-existing right pleural effusion has slightly decreased.  There are,
 however, multiple nodular parenchymal opacities in pleural location on the
 right and substantial pleural thickening, combined to a small pleural
 effusion.  The left lung and the left hemithorax appear unremarkable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.
