                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and dyspnea.  Known metastatic renal
 cell carcinoma.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  
 
 When compared to previous exam again seen is dense opacity in the right lung
 which has slightly progressed since prior with less aerated lung in the mid to
 lower regions.  Underlying opacity is likely due to combination of known
 pleural-based metastatic disease noting new parenchymal opacity cannot be
 assessed.  The left lung remains grossly clear.  Widening of the upper
 mediastinum is in part due to medial pleural-based metastases.  Cardiac
 silhouette cannot be assessed.  No acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval mild progression of disease in the right hemithorax with less aerated
 right lung compared to prior.  This is in part due to pleural-based metastatic
 disease noting that evaluation for a new parenchymal consolidation cannot be
 assessed.  Left lung remains clear.
