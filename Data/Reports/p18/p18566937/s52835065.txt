                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage IV RCC, known effusions, now new onset chest tightness and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:07 p.m.
 
 Again seen is extensive opacification of the right lung, particularly along
 the right chest wall, extending from the right base to the right apex, with
 less dense opacity extending medially into the perihilar region.  The
 mediastinum remains midline.  The left lung is grossly clear, allowing for
 minimal atelectasis at the left base and slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle.  
 
 No definite interval change is identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Small lucencies are noted in the left humeral head and possibly about the
 right superior glenoid.  These are nonspecific, but could represent lytic
 metastases.  No obvious displaced rib fracture, but assessment of the ribs is
 limited. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Extensive opacity in the right lung, densest at the right lung base and
 along the right chest wall, probably with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, but overall similar to ___.
 
 2) No CHF, ptx, or mediastinal shift identified.
 
 3) Small lucencies in the left humeral head and ? right superior glenoid.
 These are nonspecific, but the ddx could include small lytic metastases.  If
 clinically indicated, dedicated radiographs of the shoulders could help for
 further assessment.
