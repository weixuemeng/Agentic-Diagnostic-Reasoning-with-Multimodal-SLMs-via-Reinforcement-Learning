                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the
 lung.  Also with a large right pleural effusion.  Status post chest tube and
 PleurX catheter placement.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pleural catheter ends in the right perihilar region, as
 before.  A right PleurX catheter is not well visualized, better assessed on
 recent CT from ___.  An extensive pleural abnormality throughout
 the right hemithorax is seen to be loculated effusion and pleural metastases
 on recent CT from ___.  Consolidative right lower lung
 opacification is likely atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  The heart size
 is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Right lower lung dense
 atelectasis and loculated right pleural effusion with pleural-based metastases
 again noted.
