                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  As on prior, there are low lung
 volumes.  Bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis.  Blunting
 of the left lateral costophrenic angle is unchanged and also potentially due
 to atelectasis or potentially scarring.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear
 without consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged, noting moderate cardiomegaly likely accentuated by
 low lung volumes.  No definite acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities most likely due to
 atelectasis, though component of aspiration or infection cannot be entirely
 excluded.
