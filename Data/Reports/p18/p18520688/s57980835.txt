                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with assault four days ago, question fracture. 
 No further localizing information is provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  There are no prior
 exams for comparison.  The lungs are well inflated and clear.  No
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  No displaced rib fracture is apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  If there is continued clinical
 concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series with radiopaque marker at
 site of pain is more sensitive.
