                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  HIV.  Resected lung carcinoma.  Severe coughing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and read in
 conjunction with a subsequent chest CT scan ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Patient has had right middle lobectomy.  Post-operative appearance of the
 chest on the frontal view is unchanged since ___.  Anatomic detail on the
 lateral view is partially obscured by respiratory motion. There could be a new
 lung nodule as large as 15 mm wide projecting over the upper portion of the
 lowermost visible thoracic vertebral body.  For that reason I would recommend
 a repeat lateral view at suspended full inspiration supplemented by shallow
 off lateral oblique views.  The costal margins are thickened by extrapleural
 fat, and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. 
 Heart size is normal.
