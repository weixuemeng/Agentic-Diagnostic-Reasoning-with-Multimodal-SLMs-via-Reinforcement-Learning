                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after AVR and CABG. Is there any accumulation of
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions have not changed appreciably.  There is
 still substantial loss of volume in consolidation in the left lower lobe, most
 likely atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded because of the
 heterogeneous appearance of this abnormal lung.  Heart size is normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
