 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 9:35 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post AVR and CABG with recent
 coagulopathy, evaluate mediastinum.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's portable study dated ___ at 2:35
 a.m. as well as a study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9:35 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the outflow
 tract.  Endotracheal tube has the tip at the thoracic inlet.  There is a
 nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Left basilar chest tube is incompletely visualized on the current
 examination.
 
 2.  Bilateral layering pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace
 disease which likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Interval improvement in lung volumes.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable given differences in positioning, but certainly the mediastinum is
 stable if not slightly less wide on the current examination.  No pneumothorax.
