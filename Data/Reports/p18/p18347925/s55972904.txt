                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Urinary tract infection, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a preexisting small left
 pleural effusion has minimally increased in extent (at the occasion of the
 last examination the patient was after-left-thoracocentesis).  Today, however,
 the effusion is less than on ___, before thoracocentesis.  Mild
 atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas but no evidence of recent
 pneumonia.  Unremarkable right hemithorax.  A right PICC line is in unchanged
 position.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.  Unchanged clips after
 CABG.
