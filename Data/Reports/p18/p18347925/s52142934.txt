 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:23 PM
  Interval removal of all lines and tubes.  Increased hazy opacification at the
  left lung base, likely secondary to an increased small left pleural effusion
  and associated moderate to severe atelectais, although infection in this
  region is certainly possible.  Minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  A
  probable layering right pleural effusion may be slightly decreased compared to
  the radiograph from ___.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours not
  significantly changed.  No pneumothorax.
