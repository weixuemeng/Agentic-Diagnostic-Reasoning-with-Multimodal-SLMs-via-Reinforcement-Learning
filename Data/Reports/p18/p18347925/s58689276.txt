 identified.  Mediastinal drains and left basilar chest tube remain in place.
 2.  When compared to the prior study in this patient status post median
 sternotomy for CABG, there is interval widening of the mediastinal contours,
 which would be concerning for mediastinal bleeding.  There is likely a small
