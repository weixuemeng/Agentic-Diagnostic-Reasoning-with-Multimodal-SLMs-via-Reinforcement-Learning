                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A focal convexity of the left mediastinal contour in the region of
 the aorticopulmonary window is stable in the postoperative period, but new
 compared to preoperative radiographs prior to the patient's coronary bypass
 surgery procedure.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion is a persistent
 postoperative finding, accompanied by adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Right lung is grossly clear, but small pleural effusion is again demonstrated
 posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent postoperative left mediastinal widening in aorticopulmonary
 window, which may be due to a postoperative hematoma or loculated fluid
 collection.
 2.  Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Unchanged small right effusion.
