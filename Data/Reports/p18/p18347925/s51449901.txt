                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  AV replacement two months ago with shortness of breath,
 edema, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There has been
 interval placement of a right arm PICC line with its tip extending to the high
 SVC.  There is left basilar opacity compatible with effusion and likely
 compressive atelectasis.  Please note pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is no right pleural effusion and the right lung appears clear. 
 Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable aside from atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  There is right shoulder degenerative disease noted with
 degenerative spurring in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion with left basal atelectasis, cannot exclude
 pneumonia.  Please note, slight improvement compared with prior.  PICC line
 terminates in the high SVC.
