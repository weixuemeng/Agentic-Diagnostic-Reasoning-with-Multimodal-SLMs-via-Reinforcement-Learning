                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with confusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Patient is rotated to the left,
 somewhat limiting exam.  Previously seen right PICC is no longer visualized. 
 Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles is noted which could be due to a
 fat pad on the left given rotation and atelectasis versus pleural thickening
 on the right.  The known bibasilar pulmonary nodules are better assessed on
 prior CT scan.  Superiorly, the lungs are grossly clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette has not definitely changed given differences in
 positioning.  Posterior thoracic fixation hardware is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
