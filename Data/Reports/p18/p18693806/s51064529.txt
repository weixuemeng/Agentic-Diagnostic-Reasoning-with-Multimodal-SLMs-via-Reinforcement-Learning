  Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, however
  infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever, leukocytosis, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a suboptimal inspiratory effort, and low lung volumes.  Allowing for
 changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within
 normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Although possibly
 secondary to crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of a
 suboptimal inspiratory effort, there is suggestion of retrocardiac
 opacification, possibly representing atelectasis versus infection in the
 correct clinical setting.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, however
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
