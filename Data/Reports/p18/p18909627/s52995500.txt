                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tobacco history, unintentional weight loss, question occult
 malignancy.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs appear
 clear without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of CHF.
 No findings to suggest malignancy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact with mild anterior spurring in the mid T-spine.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No evidence of malignancy.  If
 there is strong clinical concern, a CT is a more sensitive exam for detection
 of small lung nodules.
