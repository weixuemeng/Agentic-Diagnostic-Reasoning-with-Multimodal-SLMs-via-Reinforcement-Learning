                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE ___ ___ X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiac arrest, evaluation for ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:28 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The NG tube has been advanced.  The side port is not included in the film
 anymore, so we are assuming it is in adequate position.  The endotracheal tube
 ends at 4.3 cm above the carina.  The rest of the exam is unchanged with mild
 pulmonary edema and more focal opacification in the right upper lung where
 pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.  The mild left pleural effusion
 and right moderate-to-severe pleural effusion is unchanged.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The NG tube has been advanced and is now in adequate position.
 2.  The rest of the exam is unchanged.
