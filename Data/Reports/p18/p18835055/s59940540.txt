                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Lung mass, status post endobronchial ultrasound, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 endobronchial ultrasound.  The metallic structure projecting over the upper
 parts of the right upper hemithorax are in unchanged position.  There are
 minimal hyperlucencies at both lung apices, reflecting the pulmonary emphysema
 documented on the CT examination from ___.  However, no evidence
 of pneumothorax is currently seen.  The mild interstitial changes at the lung
 bases, also seen on the previous CT examination, are not evident on the
 current image.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.
