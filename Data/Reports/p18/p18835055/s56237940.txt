 INDICATION:  History of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, now with fever,
 here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, metallic structure
 projecting over the upper parts of the right upper hemithorax are unchanged in
 position.  Minimal hyperlucencies at both lung apices are compatible with
 underlying pulmonary emphysema as noted on prior CT of ___.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There is interval focal consolidation at the left
 lower lobe from ___, compatible with pneumonia.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits with unchanged calcification of the aortic knob and minimal tortuosity
 of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution with
 repeat chest radiograph in six to eight weeks following appropriate course of
 therapy.
