 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC presenting with hemoptysis, s/p rigid
 bronch, IR attempted artery embolization. Patient is currently intubated,
 sedated, maintaining O2 saturations.  // interval change? improvement in
 aeration of L lung?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, widespread airspace opacities
 throughout the left lung have slightly improved, and a moderate left pleural
 effusion has probably also decreased in size in the interval.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for left lower lobe collapse, and worsening heterogeneous
 opacification at the right lung base with adjacent small right pleural
 effusion.
