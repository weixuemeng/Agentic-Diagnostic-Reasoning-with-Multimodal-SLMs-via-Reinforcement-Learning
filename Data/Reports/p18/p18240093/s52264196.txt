                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma, shortness of breath, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to patient's large body habitus and resultant
 underpenetration.  Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size remains
 moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Retrocardiac opacification could reflect
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Additionally, a small
 left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Left basilar opacification could reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded as
 well.
