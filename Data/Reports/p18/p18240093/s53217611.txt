                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent asthma flare and ongoing shortness of
 breath.
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is slight interval improvement in
 vascular congestion.  Images continue to be very substantially affected by
 motion artifact.  Within those limitations, there is interval change in right
 pleural effusion.  Left lower lung is obscured by a substantial skinfold
 projecting over the chest.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Right internal jugular
 line catheter is at the level of mid SVC.
