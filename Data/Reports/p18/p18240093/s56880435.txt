                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate right IJ positioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates
 likely at the origin of the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  In the interim
 since the prior study, performed approximately four hours earlier, there has
 been a significant increase in the size of the right-sided pleural effusion,
 which now layers across the entire right hemithorax.  There is probably a
 left-sided smaller pleural effusion.  Heart size is markedly enlarged, a
 chronic finding since as far back as ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter, likely terminates in the
 extreme upper SVC.
 2.  Marked increase in the size of the right-sided pleural effusion since the
 prior study 4 hours earlier.
 3.  Chronic cardiomegaly, given the patient's young age, correlate with
 history of congenital heart disease.  Evaluation with echocardiogram should be
 considered.  This would also serve the function of ruling out pericardial
 effusion.
 4.  Given the bilateral pleural effusions, underlying infection cannot be
 ruled out, especially in the bases.
 
 NOTE:  Initial findings regarding the increase in size of the right pleural
 effusion were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at 2:40 a.m.  Subsequent recommendations for echocardiogram
 for possible further assessment of heart size were communicated to Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 5:05 a.m.
