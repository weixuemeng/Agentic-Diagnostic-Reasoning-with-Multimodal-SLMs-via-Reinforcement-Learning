                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is markedly
 enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are also stable. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, definite focal consolidation, or
 pleural effusion.  The study is somewhat limited due to underpenetration.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart
 failure or pneumonia.
