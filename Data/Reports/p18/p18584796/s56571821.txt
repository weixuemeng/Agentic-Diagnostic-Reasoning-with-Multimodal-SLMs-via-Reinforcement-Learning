                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged, though there is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Clips are seen within the left breast and axilla.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
