                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of HIV on HAART (undetectable viral
 load) presenting with with worsening left sided back pain with cough X 1 
 month
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities within the
 right upper and middle lobes are compatible with areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis. Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects an
 additional site of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Atelectasis within the lung bases and right upper lobe, but no focal
 consolidation.
