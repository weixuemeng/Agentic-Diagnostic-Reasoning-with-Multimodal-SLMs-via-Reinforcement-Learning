                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with worsening parkinsonism x several weeks
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are quite
 low limiting assessment.  Gas seen below the right hemidiaphragm may reside
 within bowel loops though clinical correlation is advised as free
 intraperitoneal air is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting. 
 There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia, edema, large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits
 given technique.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Gas below the right hemidiaphragm likely resides within bowel loops at
 though clinical correlation for abdominal pain is advised as pneumoperitoneum
 is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia or edema.
