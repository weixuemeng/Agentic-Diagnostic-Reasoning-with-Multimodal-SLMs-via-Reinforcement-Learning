                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient extubated post pericardial window
 operation, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  Marked regression of enlarged heart
 silhouette consistent with the performance of a pericardial window and related
 pericardial evacuation.  The previously observed row of sternal wires appears
 unchanged.  There is; however, evidence of renewed substernal surgical
 approach as a pleural drainage tube has been approached from below and is seen
 to drain the lateral posterior pleural sinus.  No evidence of any major
 pleural effusion and no pneumothorax is identified.  There exists now an
 unexplained local parenchymal density partially overlying the left-sided heart
 border.  This density was not seen on the previous portable chest examination
 as it was concealed by the, at that time, very enlarged heart shadow.  There
 is no evidence of newly developed pulmonary congestion or other new
 parenchymal infiltrates.  No pneumothorax on either side.
