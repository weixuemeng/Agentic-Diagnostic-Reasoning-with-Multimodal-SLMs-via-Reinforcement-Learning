                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT, ?deep  // ETT position?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 3 cm above the level
 the carina.  A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.
 A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  A nasogastric
 tube terminates in the stomach.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities,
 more extensive on the right than the left were there is a small pleural
 effusion tracking along the lateral chest wall.  Left lower lobe atelectasis
 versus consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities more extensive on the right than the left likely
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema.
