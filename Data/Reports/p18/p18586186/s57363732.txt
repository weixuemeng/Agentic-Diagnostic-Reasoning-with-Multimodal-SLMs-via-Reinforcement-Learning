                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe sepsis on CRRT  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of endotracheal tube is at the level of the carinal with the neck in a
 flexed position.  This could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning. 
 Large layering bilateral pleural effusions have apparently increased in size
 since the recent radiograph, although positional differences somewhat limit
 comparison.  No other relevant changes since recent study.
