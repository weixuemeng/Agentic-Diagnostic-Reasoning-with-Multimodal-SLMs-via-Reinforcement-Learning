                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of renal transplant, on
 tacrolimus, azathioprine and prednisone with three weeks cough and fatigue. 
 Assess for infiltrate.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is
 present.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of
 ___.  It is noted that the heart size appeared to be slightly larger
 at that time.  Thus, at present stage, there is no evidence of any hemodynamic
 condition that either results in pulmonary congestion or venous stasis.  No
 acute infiltrates or pleural effusion.
