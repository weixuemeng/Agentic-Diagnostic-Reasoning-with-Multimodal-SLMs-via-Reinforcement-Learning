                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal lateral views of the chest were performed.
 
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size and unchanged.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  A washed out appearance of
 the bone is thought to reflect changes of renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
