                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough for two weeks.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size.  Minimal leftward shift of the cardiac silhouette, similar to
 prior, is likely related to the patient's pectus excavatum.  Hazy opacity
 adjacent to the right heart border is similar to prior and also likely related
 to pectus excavatum.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
