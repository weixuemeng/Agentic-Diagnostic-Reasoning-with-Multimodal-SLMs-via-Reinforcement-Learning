                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___ year old man with left chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hazy opacity obscuring the right heart border which
 appears to represent a right middle lobe, medial segment pneumonia.  The left
 lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is difficult
 to assess due to adjacent consolidation, though heart size appears normal on
 the lateral projection.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with right middle lobe medial segment
 pneumonia.
