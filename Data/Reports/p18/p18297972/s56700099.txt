                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary
 artery bypass surgery.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar contours appear more full
 compared to baseline study of ___, and may reflect engorged
 pulmonary vessels, particularly given the presence of scattered bilateral
 septal line suggestive of interstitial edema.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities
 reported on the recent study of one day earlier have slightly improved, but a
 new opacity has developed peripherally at the left base. Residual right
 infrahilar opacity has a nodular configuration and should be followed to
 ensure resolution. Bilateral small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
 
 Healed left rib fractures are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild CHF with interstitial edema.
 2.  Rapidly improving lower lobe opacities could reflect improving edema or
 aspiration.  Continued radiographic followup recommended, particularly to
 ensure resolution of right infrahilar opacity.
