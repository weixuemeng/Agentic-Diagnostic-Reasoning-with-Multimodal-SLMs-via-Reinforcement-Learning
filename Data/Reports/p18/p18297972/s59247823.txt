                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  EKG changes and syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Fissures are mildly thickened, but
 without evidence for parenchymal edema.  A focal opacity projects along the
 left lung base, new since the prior study, raising concern for pneumonia.  The
 left hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated.  The bones are probably
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity along the medial left lung base, raising concern
 for pneumonia.  If clinical findings suggesting an infectious process are not
 present, however, CT is suggested to exclude a mass; otherwise chest
 radiographs are suggested within eight weeks in order to show resolution.
