                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with NSTEMI, presenting with tachypnea,
 hypoxemia, and small volume hemoptysis.  Evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates dense consolidations
 at the bilateral lung bases, right greater than left.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular prominence or significant pulmonary edema. There is no
 pneumothorax or visible pleural effusion.   The previously seen median
 sternotomy wires are unchanged in position and remain intact.  The heart is
 normal in size.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral lung base opacifications, right greater than left.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, this may represent an infectious process. 
 Followup with conventional radiographs would be recommended.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
