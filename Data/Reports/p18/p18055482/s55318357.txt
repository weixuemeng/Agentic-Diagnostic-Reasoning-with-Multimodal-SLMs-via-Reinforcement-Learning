                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:58 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with basal ganglia hemorrhage and possible
 aspiration.  Now febrile.  Is there pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lungs are very low in volume, exaggerating vascular crowding, making it
 difficult to exclude edema.  There is no focal abnormality to suggest
 pneumonia or large scale aspiration.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any. 
 Heart size is normal.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube is
 folded in the stomach, with the tip heading back to the gastroesophageal
 junction.  No pneumothorax.
