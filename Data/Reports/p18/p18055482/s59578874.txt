                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate amount of free air seen under the hemidiaphragms, however
 this is decreased compared to the study from the prior evening.  There is
 volume loss in both lower lungs with areas of compressive atelectasis.  There
 is pulmonary vascular redistribution compatible with fluid overload.
