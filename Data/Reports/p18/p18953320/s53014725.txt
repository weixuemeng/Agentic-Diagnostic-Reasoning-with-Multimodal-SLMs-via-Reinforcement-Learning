                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  There is no
 focal consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No signs of pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable aside from faint atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic
 knob.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly without signs of pneumonia or CHF.
