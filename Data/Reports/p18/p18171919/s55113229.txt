                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluate position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous opacities along the medial aspect of the right lung
 base seen on prior CT from ___ are not well appreciated on the
 current study.  Left lower lung heterogeneous opacities are not significantly
 changed compared to prior CT, thought to represent an area of aspiration
 pneumonitis/pneumonia.  The remainder of the lungs is clear.  Apparent
 enlargement of the heart is thought to be secondary to decreased lung volumes
 rather than true cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Trace
 pleural effusions seen on prior CT are not appreciated on the current
 radiograph.  There is no pneumothorax.  A new enteric catheter passes below
 the level of the diaphragm, then curves superiorly to end within the gastric
 cardia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enteric catheter passes below the diaphragm, although curves superiorly to
 end in the gastric cardia.
 
 2.  Left lower lung heterogeneous opacities, thought to represent aspiration
 pneumonitis/pneumonia, not significantly changed compared to recent CT.  Right
 medial lung base opacities seen on prior CT are not well visualized by
 conventional radiography.
