                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal surgery with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is a thin streak of gas beneath the
 hemidiaphragmatic contour, consistent with pneumoperitoneum related to recent
 surgery.  However, there is no evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.
