                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypertension with ST
 elevation MI after PCI.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate.  Mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is
 dilatation of the right upper mediastinum that is in conjunction with upper
 zone redistribution and mild perihilar linear opacities consistent with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no pleural
 effusion appreciable on the chest radiograph seen.
