 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, hypoxia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:49 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in interstitial markings, most notable at the level of the bronchial walls and
 the peripheral interstitium.  This change could reflect mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly. 
 Normal recently placed right PICC line.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
