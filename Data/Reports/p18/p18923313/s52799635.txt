                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with COPD and increased work of breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate relative lucency
 of the apices consistent with emphysema.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is similar to priors.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema, without acute chest abnormality.
