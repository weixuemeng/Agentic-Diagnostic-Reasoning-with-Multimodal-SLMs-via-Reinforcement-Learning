                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable CXR
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PVI  // pulmonary edema? received about 5
 liters during the case and ___ sat is ___% on 10 liters
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable radiograph of the chest was performed.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular markings.  There is
 discoid atelectasis of the bilateral upper lungs.  Opacities in the
 retrocardiac region also likely represent atelectasis.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The heart is at least top normal in size.  Apparent widening
 of the mediastinum is likely secondary to a combination of vascular congestion
 and adjacent atelectasis, with an acute mediastinal process felt less likely
 in the absence of any chest pain.  There may be a small amount of pleural
 fluid on the left.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Repeat with better respiratory effort
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Discoid atelectasis of the bilateral upper
 lungs.  Retrocardiac opacities, also likely representing atelectasis.
 
 2.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum, likely secondary to a combination of
 vascular congestion and adjacent atelectasis, with an acute mediastinal
 process felt less likely in the absence of any chest pain.  However, repeat AP
 radiograph with better inspiration is recommended.
 
  This preliminary report was reviewed with Dr. ___, ___
 radiologist.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat AP radiograph with better inspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, NP by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:39 PM, 15 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
