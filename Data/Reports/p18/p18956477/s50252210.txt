 radiograph.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Cardiac MRI from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top-normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Previously seen left upper lobe and upper mediastinal
 opacities from the ___ are no longer visualized, likely reflecting
 resolved atelectasis and improved inspiratory effort.  There is no
 pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Prior combination of atelectasis and vascular
 congestion along the left upper lobe has resolved since the ___
 examination.
