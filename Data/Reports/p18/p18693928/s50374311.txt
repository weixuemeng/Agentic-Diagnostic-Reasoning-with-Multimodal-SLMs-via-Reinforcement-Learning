                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam from approximately one hour earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ET tube placed, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Endotracheal
 tube is seen with its tip located approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  The
 NG tube courses into the left lower chest, which may reside within a hiatal
 hernia.  The tube does not appear to follow the course of either main stem
 bronchus, therefore likely residing within the distal esophagus.  Cardiomegaly
 is again noted with retrocardiac opacity, unchanged.  Left CP angle excluded. 
 Coarse calcifications in the right breast/axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned NG tube with tip likely in the distal esophagus. 
 Recommend advancement.  ET tube positioned appropriately.  No change in
 cardiopulmonary status.  Findings posted and flagged to the ED dashboard at
 the time of this dictation.
