 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  With prior exam from approximately one hour earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sepsis with central line placement, assess position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest provided demonstrates interval
 placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the region of
 the low SVC.  The endotracheal tube remains well positioned with its tip
 located approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There has been interval removal
 of the nasogastric tube. Cardiomegaly persists with possible interval
 development of mild pulmonary edema.  Otherwise, no change.
