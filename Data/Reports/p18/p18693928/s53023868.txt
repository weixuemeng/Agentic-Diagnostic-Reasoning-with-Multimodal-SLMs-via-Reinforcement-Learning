                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with NG tube placed, check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.
 During the latest examination interval, an NG tube has been placed.  It can be
 followed on the chest view to have a very unusual course meandering through
 the mediastinal area and  finally terminates with a curve in the left upper
 abdominal area close to the level of the diaphragm.  Making comparison with
 the next preceding portable chest examination, one can expect the presence of
 a large hiatal hernia.  To confirm this finding the CT chest, abdomen and
 pelvis examination of ___ was reviewed and indeed a very large
 hiatal hernia is present with more than ___% of the stomach being located above
 the diaphragm.  Comparing the CT images in coronal view with the findings on
 the portable chest examination suggests that the line terminates within the
 body of the stomach but has not reached the pylorus or the duodenum, which are
 identified well below the level of the diaphragms.  Comparing the chest
 findings, the ETT is seen to terminate unchanged in appropriate position,
 unchanged appearance of right internal jugular vein approach central venous
 line and no pneumothorax.  Findings suggestive of pulmonary congestion and
 bilateral pleural effusion persist rather unchanged. Impression: NG tube
 reaches upper half of Stomach in large hiatal hernia.
