                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic rcc  // post bronch      post
 bronch
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:11 and selected images from a
 chest CT performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest film of ___ at 19:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Focal airspace consolidation in the right mid to lower
 lung, which when correlated with the CT, likely corresponds to a more
 confluent opacity within the right middle lobe or represents post bronchoscopy
 changes. The right paratracheal soft tissue is prominent and likely
 corresponds to lymphadenopathy as evident on recent CT.  The multiple
 pulmonary nodules seen on the recent CT are less apparent on the plain
 radiograph.  In addition, the CT better demonstrates the extensive hilar and
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  No large effusions are seen. No pneumothorax.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given lower lung
 volumes and differences in patient positioning.  No large pneumothorax
 ,although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.
