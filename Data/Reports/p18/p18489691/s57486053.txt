                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with seizure, tachycardia, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged, with
 widening of the right paratracheal stripe compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy, not substantially changed in the interval.  Hilar contours
 are obscured though likely enlarged due to lymphadenopathy.  There is
 near-total opacification of the right lung, perhaps minimally increased
 compared to the previous radiograph, reflecting a combination of pulmonary
 metastases, right middle lobe collapse, and lymphangitic spread of tumor. 
 Similar findings are also noted in the left lung, but are less pronounced, and
 this asymmetry again may be due to the presence of superimposed infection.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perhaps slight interval worsening of near total opacification of the right
 lung due to metastatic disease with lymphangitic spread of tumor and right
 middle lobe collapse.  Similar findings of diffuse metastatic disease are seen
 in the left lung though to a lesser extent, and this asymmetry again may be
 due to the presence of superimposed infection in the right lung.
