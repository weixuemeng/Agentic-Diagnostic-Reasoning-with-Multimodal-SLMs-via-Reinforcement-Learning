                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  History of renal cell carcinoma.  Fever, tachycardia and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT dated
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a dense
 consolidation involving the right middle lobe, as before.  There are also
 extensive opacities in the right upper lobe as well as more patchy
 distribution of nodular opacities in the left lung.  Allowing for differences
 in technique, there is increased diffuse interstitial abnormality but
 otherwise probably no recent change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with metastatic disease including lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis and nodules; however, mild to moderate diffuse superimposed
 interstitial abnormality is suspected and could be seen with pulmonary edema
 or perhaps atypical infectious process in the appropriate setting.
