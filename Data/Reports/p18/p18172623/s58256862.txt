                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of dysphagia and silent aspiration with
 leukocytosis.  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right basal opacity has appeared, which may represent
 aspiration.  Lateral view does not show the opacity.  No pleural effusion,
 pulmonary congestion or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart and  mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The right subclavian PICC line ends at the mid SVC and
 is in stable position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar opacity may represent aspiration.  Recommend
 followup imaging in 24 hours to better evaluate.
