                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle opacity projecting over the left upper-to-mid lung at the level of the
 posterior left seventh rib, unclear whether artifactual or pulmonary or
 possibly due to external artifact.  Correlate with any external artifact at
 this location.  If none, consider oblique views or followup chest CT.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and likely in part distorted due to
 patient's thoracolumbar scoliosis.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified with
 mediastinal contours relatively stable.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic, and again
 there is deformity of the  proximal-to-mid right humerus, longstanding.  There
 has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC.  There are multiple chronic
 right-sided rib deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe thoracolumbar scoliosis.
 2.  Subtle opacity projecting over the left mid lung as above, may be
 artifactual due to external artifact, correlate with external artifact at this
 location.  If none, suggest oblique views or non-urgent chest CT to assess for
 underlying lesion.
