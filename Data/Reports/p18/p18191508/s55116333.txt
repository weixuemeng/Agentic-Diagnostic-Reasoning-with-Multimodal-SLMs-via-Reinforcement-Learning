                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Problem with PICC.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:52.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No PICC or central venous catheter is identified.  There has been no
 significant interval change in the appearance of the chest compared to the
 prior study performed earlier the same day.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is diffuse
 calcification of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax is noted, but assessment
 of the lung apices is obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over this
 area.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No PICC identified.
