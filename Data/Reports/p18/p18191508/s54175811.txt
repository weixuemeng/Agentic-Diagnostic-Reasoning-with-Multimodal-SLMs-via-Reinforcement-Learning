                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rhonchorous breath sounds, to assess for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is striking hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse
 interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac
 silhouette is somewhat enlarged given the degree of hyperexpansion and there
 is some tortuosity of the aorta that is diffusely calcified.  The costophrenic
 angles are again blunted.
 
 Although no acute focal consolidation is appreciated, this would be difficult
 to detect given the pulmonary changes and supervening pneumonia would have to
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
