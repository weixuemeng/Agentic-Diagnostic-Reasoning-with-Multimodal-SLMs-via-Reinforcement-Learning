                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestion and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Previously noted left upper lobe nodular opacity is not distinctly visualized
 on the current exam.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky
 bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view could reflect trace
 pleural effusions or pleural thickening.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
