                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall head strike and loc  // Eval for any
 injuries
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.  There is suggestion
 of mild peribronchiolar cuffing.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of rib fracture on this nondedicated exam.  Anterior wedging of a
 lower thoracic vertebral body with approximately ___% anterior loss of
 vertebral body height is new since ___, however the age is indeterminate. 
 Aortic knob calcifications have progressed since ___.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinum is not widened.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ___% loss of anterior vertebral body height of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body, new since ___, age indeterminate.  Correlate with clinical assessment
 and focal exam findings given history of trauma.  Consider dedicated imaging
 as needed.
 
 2.  No evidence of rib fracture on this nondedicated exam.  Consider dedicated
 rib films if focal exam findings point to possible rib fracture.
 
 3.  Suggestion of mild peribronchiolar wall thickening which could be seen
 with bronchial inflammation, thought less likely to be edema.
