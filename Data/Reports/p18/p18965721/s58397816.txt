                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with b/l chest tubes placed today  // please
 characterize RLL lucency      please characterize RLL lucency
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Opacification at the right base most likely represents atelectatic changes,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have
 to be considered.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Right subclavian
 catheter extends to the mid to lower SVC.
