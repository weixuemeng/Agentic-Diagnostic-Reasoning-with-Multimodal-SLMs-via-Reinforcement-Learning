                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, s/p pericardiocentesis  //
 Evaluate for interval change in cardiac silhouette, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Left IJ central line tip in the region of the distal SVC/RA junction.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF
 with interstitial edema.
 
 There is a moderate size right pleural effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation at the right base.  In addition, there is increased
 retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and probable
 small left effusion.
 
 Loops linear radiodensity overlying the lower left base,  question outside the
 patient.  This appears to correspond to something outside the chest on the
 prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF findings, which has increased considerably compared with the film from 1
 day earlier.
 
 Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation and bilateral right-greater-than-left
 effusions, also progressed compared to 1 day earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Direct comparison to the prior film is limited due to
 differences in positioning.  No radiographic evidence of pericardial air,
 pneumomediastinum, or pneumothorax.
