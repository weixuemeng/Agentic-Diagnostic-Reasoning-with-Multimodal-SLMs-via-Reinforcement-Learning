                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  The endotracheal tube is not precisely seen on the study,
 suggesting that it may have its tip in the mid cervical region or higher. 
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  
 
 Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach with the tip distal to the
 cardioesophageal junction.  The large central catheter tip is in the region of
 the mid portion of the SVC.
