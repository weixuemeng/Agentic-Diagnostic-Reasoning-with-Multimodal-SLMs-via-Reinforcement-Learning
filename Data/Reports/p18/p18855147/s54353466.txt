                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To rule out pneumothorax.  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison
 with multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  Left lower lung opacity is likely
 a combination of small atelectasis and probably a small effusion.  Right small
 pleural effusion is presumed.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, and the
 pulmonary vasculature is minimally congested.  A right central line tip ends
 at lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema. Left lower lung opacity is likely a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion and right lung base atelectasis is
 minimal. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
