                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip in the body of the esophagus. 
 The side hole is in the region of the gastroesophageal junction and the tube
 should be advanced several centimeters.
 
 Pulmonary vessels are less well defined than on the previous study, consistent
 with some mild increase in pulmonary venous pressure.
