                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:36
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___, at 14:48.
 
 A single portable erect chest film ___ at 6:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided internal jugular dual-lumen catheter is unchanged in position.
 There is worsening bilateral airspace and interstitial process, which most
 likely reflects worsening pulmonary and interstitial edema, possibly
 superimposed on underlying chronic interstitial changes.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the
 current examination.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Probable small left
 layering pleural effusion.
