                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including
 cholangitis status post recent stent placement now with leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 stable, with mild cardiomegaly.  There is a new moderate-sized right pleural
 effusion with compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  There is
 worsening pulmonary vascular congestion, superimposed right sided edema is
 hard to exlcude, given the right lower lobe volume loss. No pneumothorax is
 detected.  Dense calcifications overlying the left ventricle, likely represent
 pericardial calcification, or a  combination of pericardial/myocardial
 calcification. Two biliary stents are in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Worsening vascular congestion, with possible mild edema.
 2. Moderate right pleural effusion with right basal atelectasis.
