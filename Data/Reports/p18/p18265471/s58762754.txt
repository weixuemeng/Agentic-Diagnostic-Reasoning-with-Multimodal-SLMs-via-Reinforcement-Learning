                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cholangitis and recent intubation. 
 Evaluate position of ET tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from ___.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 2.8 cm above the carina. 
 This could be pulled back 1-2 cm for more optimal placement.  There is a
 feeding tube whose distal tip and side port are in the fundus of the stomach. 
 Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal.  There is a left retrocardiac
 opacity.  There is some blurring at the lung bases due to motion artifact;
 however, they are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Several healed rib fractures are seen on the left side.
