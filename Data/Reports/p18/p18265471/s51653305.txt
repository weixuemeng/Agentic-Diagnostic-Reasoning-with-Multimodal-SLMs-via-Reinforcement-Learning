                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with CHF, evaluate for interval change
 in vascular congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  Cardiac enlargement as before.  The
 pulmonary congestive pattern with bilateral pleural effusion and perivascular
 haze in the pulmonary vasculature persists and remains unchanged in degree. 
 Noticed is now the presence of a right-sided PICC line which is seen to
 terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures 3 cm below the
 level of the carina.  This is compatible with the lower third of the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax has developed.  The enlarged heart shadow is screened by applying
 different levels of density penetration and one can indeed identify a sizeable
 semilunar calcification in the lower portion of the heart shadow.  This
 finding existed already on several previous portable chest examinations. 
 Review of an abdominal CT examination, which includes the lower portion of the
 chest clearly identifies these calcifications to be in the periphery of the
 posterior left ventricular wall.  This finding is rather typical for an old
 (more than ___ years) myocardial posterior wall infarction with calcified
 aneurysm formation.  Finding appears stable.  This presence explains readily
 the patient's poor cardiac performance and pulmonary congestion.
