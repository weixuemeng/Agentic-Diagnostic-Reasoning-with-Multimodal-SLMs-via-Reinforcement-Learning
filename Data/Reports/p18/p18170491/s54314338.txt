                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage, transferred from
 outside hospital, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Advancement of the ET tube by at least 2 cm to the
 level of the thoracic inlet is recommended.  The tip of a nasointestinal tube
 terminates in the cervical trachea and needs to be repositioned.  The lungs
 are clear.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Apparent mediastinal widening is
 likely secondary to the supine AP technique.  The cardiac size appears
 generous, though also likely technical.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube 7 cm from the carina.  Advancement by at least 2 cm to
 the level of thoracic inlet is recommended.
 2.  Malpositioned nasointestinal tube, with the distal tip in the cervical
 trachea.
 3.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Impression #1 was communicated to Dr. ___ at 7:13 am in person and
