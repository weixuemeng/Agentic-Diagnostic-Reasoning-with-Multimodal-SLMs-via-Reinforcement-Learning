                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of polysubstance abuse, now
 with rapidly expanding left basal ganglia hypertensive IPH and IVH, associated
 with mass effect and subfalcine herniation, now status post left
 hemicraniectomy and temporary EVD placement.  Evaluate for repositioned ETT
 and NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 obtained one and a half hour earlier.  In comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination, the ETT position has been adjusted.  It is now terminating
 at a level 5 cm above the carina.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Previously
 described right-sided subclavian approach central venous line remains in
 unchanged position.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in comparison
 with the next preceding study can be identified on portable semi-erect single
 view examination.  NG tube reaches well below the diaphragm and is curled up
 in the fundus of the stomach.
