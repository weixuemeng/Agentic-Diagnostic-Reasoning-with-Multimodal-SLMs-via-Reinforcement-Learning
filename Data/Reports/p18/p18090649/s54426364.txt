                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS: ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  Left-sided
 abandoned pacer wires are also similar.  Cardiac enlargement, as well as the
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar.  Indistinct upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vasculature and perihilar fullness is somewhat
 increased suggesting mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes along the lower and mid
 thoracic spines are similar.  No free air is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence for free air.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.
