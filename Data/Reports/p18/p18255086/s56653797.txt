                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right-sided chest pain and tenderness.
 
 STUDY:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest as well as dedicated right rib
 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Bone scan from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.  MR of the thoracic and lumbar spine from ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:
 
 CHEST:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob as well as a
 mildly tortuous aorta.  The lungs show no consolidation.  A vascular stent
 material projects over the heart as well as over a branch of the aortic arch,
 best seen on lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Compression deformities in the mid lower thoracic spine are unchanged from
 prior MR.
 
 ___ is diffuse osteopenia, limiting assessment of subtle nondisplaced
 fracture.  Two BBs have been placed to the lateral aspect of the right thorax
 to demarcate the patient's site of pain.  Focal irregularities in the eighth
 and ninth lateral ribs represent old/healing fractures.  Given limitations in
 technique, these are not apparent on prior radiograph or prior bone scan.
