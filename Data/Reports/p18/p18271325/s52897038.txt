                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after Whipple surgery with
 COPD, shortness of breath.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. 
 The bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated than on the prior study
 but unclear if increased or just due to re-distribution.  The free
 intraperitoneal air is less visible on the current examination and there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild vascular engorgement is present, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.
