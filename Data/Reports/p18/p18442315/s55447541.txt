                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Lungs
 are hyperexpanded but grossly clear except for patchy bibasilar opacities,
 left greater than right, adjacent to small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bones
 are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of a severe compression
 deformity at the thoracoabdominal junction (T11), as well as an additional
 compression fracture at T9 which has been treated with vertebroplasty. 
 Additionally, healed rib fractures are present bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right.  Differential
 diagnosis includes atelectasis, aspiration and early pneumonia.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
