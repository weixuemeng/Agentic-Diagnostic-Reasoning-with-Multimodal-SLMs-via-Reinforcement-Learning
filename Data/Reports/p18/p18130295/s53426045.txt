  Bilateral pleural effusions, large on the left and small on the right are
  slightly larger compared to prior.
  Abnormal contour projecting over the AP window is more conspicuous on the
  current exam and while this could be due to loculated plueral fluid, change in
  the contour of the aorta with known underlying dissection is possible and
  should be assessed by CTA, already ordered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with pleuritic chest pain radiating to back. Cough. hx of
 marfans w/ recent surgery for Type B   A dissection into coronaries.
 Tachypneic tachy. Tender in epigastric region at surgical site  // PE? PNA?
 PTX? Surgical site infection?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large left and small right pleural effusions are both slightly larger when
 compared to prior.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiac silhouette cannot
 be assessed given silhouetting, particularly on the left.  Abnormal contour of
 the left mediastinum at the AP window is somewhat more pronounced when
 compared to prior.  Prosthetic aortic valve and median sternotomy wires are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, large on the left and small on the right are
 slightly larger compared to prior.
 Abnormal contour projecting over the AP window is more conspicuous on the
 current exam and while this could be due to loculated pleural fluid, change in
 the contour of the aorta with known underlying dissection is possible and
 should be assessed by CTA which is already ordered.
