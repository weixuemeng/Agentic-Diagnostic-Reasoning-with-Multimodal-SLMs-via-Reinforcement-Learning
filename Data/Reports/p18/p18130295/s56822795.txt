                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a pleural effusion status post left
 pigtail catheter placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Prosthetic aortic valve appears intact. 
 Pulmonary artery catheter is in unchanged position.  Left chest tube is in
 unchanged position with its tip projecting just below the left apex.  Stable,
 mild cardiomegaly likely reflects the known pericardial effusion.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Stable, probable, small right
 pleural effusion.  Interval decrease in moderate left pleural effusion and
 adjacent relaxation atelectasis.  Unchanged, tiny left apical pneumothorax. 
 There is no evidence of right pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Unchanged, mild to moderate right basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged, tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Interval decrease in moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis.
