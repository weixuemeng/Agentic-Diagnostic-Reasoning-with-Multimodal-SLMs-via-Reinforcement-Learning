  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Prosthetic valve is noted.  Surgical
  clips project over at the left mediastinal border.  The left cardiac border is
  obscured.  A moderate left-sided pleural effusion appears increased in size
  relative to prior examination.  A small left apical pneumothorax is probably
  increased in size relative to prior study.
