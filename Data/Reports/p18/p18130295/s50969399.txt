    EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman new left chest tube  // assess left effusion   
 assess left effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of a
 left chest tube with its tip just below the apex of the left lung.  There may
 be a small pneumothorax.  Allowing for differences in elevation of the
 patient, there is probably little change in the degree of pleural effusion and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.
