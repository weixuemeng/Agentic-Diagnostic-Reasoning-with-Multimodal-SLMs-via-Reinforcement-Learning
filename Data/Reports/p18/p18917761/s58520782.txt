 post surgical changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently one ___.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has improved slightly.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  Top-normal heart size is
 unchanged.  And azygos distension is only mild and stable.
 
 Tip of the new Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the pulmonary outflow tract or
 pulmonic valve, but is probably not in the main pulmonary artery.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, but sharp definition of the upper margin of
 the cuff suggests tracheal secretions are pooling above it.  Two esophageal
 tubes pass into the stomach and out of view.
