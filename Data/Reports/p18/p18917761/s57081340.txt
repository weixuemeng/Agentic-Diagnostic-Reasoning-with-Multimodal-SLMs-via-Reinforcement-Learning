                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with  cough and fever.  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are patchy regions of consolidation at the lung bases, particularly in
 the retrocardiac region.  Superiorly, lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar regions of consolidation, left greater than right.  While some of
 this may be due to atelectasis given relatively low lung volumes, superimposed
 infection is suspected, particularly on the left.
