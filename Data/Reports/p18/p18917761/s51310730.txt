                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new a-fib  // tunneled HD line placement    
 tunneled HD line placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 New heterogeneous pulmonary abnormalities are very asymmetrically distributed.
 
 The perihilar left upper lobe component contains vascular congestion and
 increased background density, looking much like pulmonary edema.  The right
 lower lobe component is more densely opacified shallow, shows some volume
 loss, and is accompanied by small right pleural effusion.  I cannot ascribed
 this simply day asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Instead I suggest consideration
 of edema in the setting of large pulmonary emboli or, alternatively, large
 scale aspiration.
 
 Heart is slightly larger but normal size.  Incidental note is made of
 continues severe splenomegaly or other left upper quadrant mass effect.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional chest radiograph, consider CT scanning
 if the radiographic findings are still confounding.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___ , M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:38 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
