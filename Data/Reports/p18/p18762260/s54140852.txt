 compare to prior
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes remain quite low.  Atelectasis has improved in the right upper
 lobe, but is still severe in the left lower.  There is still pulmonary
 vascular congestion, with vascular crowding exaggerated by low lung volumes,
 which also increased apparent mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular
 engorgement.  Cardiac dysfunction or volume overload is relatively mild.  No
 pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion on the although small amount of
 pleural fluid could be present.
