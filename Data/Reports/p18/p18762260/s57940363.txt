                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD___ s/p L partial Nx, now with somnolence,
 evaluate for aspiration, PNA other acute pulm processes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright frontal view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Very low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Opacities in the medial
 lungs bilaterally may represent collapsed lower lobes or consolidation.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Allowing
 for patient positioning and low lung volumes the cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is likely unchanged.  Evaluation for pneumoperitoneum is limited on these
 semi-upright views.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very low lung volumes with medial consolidative opacities bilaterally which
 may represent lower lobe collapse or consolidation, depending on the clinical
 circumstances.
