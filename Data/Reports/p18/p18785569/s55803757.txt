                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New white count, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly, with left a ventricular configuration.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  Increased opacity projecting over the heart on the frontal
 view likely represents a hiatal hernia.  The hernia itself was better
 delineated on a film dated ___.  There is atelectasis and/or scarring in
 the lower lobe posteriorly.  Mild eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 noted.  No CHF.  The mid and upper zones of both lungs remain grossly clear. 
 No definite consolidation.  Degenerative changes and ossification of the
 anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Background COPD.
 2.  Cardiomegaly, with unfolded aorta.
 3.  Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
 4.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite consolidation.   Subtle infiltrate
 could be obscured by the hiatal hernia, but no air bronchograms are
 appreciated.
 5.  No CHF.
