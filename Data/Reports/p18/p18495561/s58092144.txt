                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute, displaced
 rib fracture is evident on this conventional chest radiograph examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic findings to account for chest pain.  If a
 vascular etiology is suspected clinically, dedicated CTA study may be
 considered if warranted clinically.
