                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Four days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, now
 with dyspnea and cough productive of green sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 opacity projecting over the left costophrenic angle is likely due to overlying
 soft tissue and that region is not optimally assessed.  The patient has a
 known large hiatal hernia with subtle retrocardiac air-fluid levels seen. 
 There is no definite focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable, particularly in comparison with ___ with possible minimal
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Large hiatal hernia.
