                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST of ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube coils in the proximal stomach before terminating
 within the distal stomach.  Endotracheal tube and central venous catheter
 remain in standard position.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Worsening opacity in left
 lower hemithorax, which may reflect a combination of pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis or infectious consolidation.  Otherwise, no relevant
 changes since recent study.
