 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained on ___ at 4:31 p.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 6.3 cm above the carina.  The right internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  There is interval
 progression of left lower lobe opacities that might reflect aspiration in
 combination with pleural effusion or potentially worsening atelectasis.
