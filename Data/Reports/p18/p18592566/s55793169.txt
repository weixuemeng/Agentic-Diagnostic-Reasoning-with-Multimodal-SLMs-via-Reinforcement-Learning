                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 18:36 HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As noted previously, dual-chamber pacemaker is in stable and
 standard course and position from a left subclavian approach.  There is an
 apparent single abandoned lead from a right subclavian approach, which is
 situated within the anterior right chest wall.  There is venous hypertension
 and cepphalized flow.  The pulmonary vessels are indistinct.  Linear
 atelectasis is seen at the right lung base.  There is a tortuous
 atherosclerotic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette remains massively enlarged. 
 Prior bowel surgery is evident.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  A
 ring-like density projects over the central aspect of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body which is not clearly evident on prior imaging.  No displaced fractures
 are noted.  There are no compression vertebral fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology. 
 Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis.  A ring-like
 structure over the vertebral body is indeterminate etiology or clinical
 significance.  It could be artifactual.  Dedicated thoracic spine radiographs
 would likely be useful in short order to further corroborate the finding as
 truly within the vertebral body to assess for reproducibility.
