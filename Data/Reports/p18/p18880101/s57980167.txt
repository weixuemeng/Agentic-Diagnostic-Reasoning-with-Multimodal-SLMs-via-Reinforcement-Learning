 An area of increased opacity is present in the right upper lobe.  Previous
 right mid lung lucencies are less prominent and less concerning for cavitary
 pneumonia.  There are bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
 compressive atelectasis.  Moderate pulmonary edema primarily in the lung bases
 has improved.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 2.  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 
 3.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
