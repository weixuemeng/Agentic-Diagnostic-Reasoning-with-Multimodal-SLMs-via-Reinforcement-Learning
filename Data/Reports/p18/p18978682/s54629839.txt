                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The
 heart size is normal.  The aorta remains slightly tortuous with vascular
 calcifications noted.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures,
 but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy opacities in the lower lobes
 may reflect areas of developing infection or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.  Multiple clips are again noted within the left axilla. 
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints are noted.  Old
 right-sided rib deformities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with mild patchy opacities in the lung bases. 
 This could reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
