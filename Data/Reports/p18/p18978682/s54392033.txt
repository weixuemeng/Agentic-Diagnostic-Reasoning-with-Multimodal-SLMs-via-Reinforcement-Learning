  No significant change. Left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of
  pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlyikng consolidation is not
  excluded. Apparent irregular curve of the R PICC in the upper SVC may be due
  to the patient's position. Distal tip of the PICC remains in the mid to low
  SVC. No new consolidation. No pneumothorax.

 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with sudden onset of wheezing, a moderate
 respiratory distress.  Evaluate for aspiration versus fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There are low lung volumes with atelectasis at the lung bases and a
 left retrocardiac opacity.  This is unchanged.  Surgical clips within the left
 axilla are again seen.  There are several healed old right-sided rib
 fractures.  No pneumothoraces are seen.
