 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of lung cancer, cough,
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Reference also made to CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In
 comparison to the scout radiograph from the CT of ___ again seen is
 right apical opacity with surgical clips seen, likely a combination of
 post-surgical changes and radiation-related changes.  There is increased
 volume loss in the left lung.  There is increased opacity in the left mid lung
 field, difficult to discern whether related to history of malignancy or acute
 underlying infection.  There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles
 suggesting trace pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation seen in the right
 lung.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Difficult to assess cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes due to the right hemithorax opacification.
