                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma with xiphoid fracture from outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___, ___, on ___ at 4:55

 FINDINGS:  Frontal chest radiograph is very rotated to the right.  Comparison
 is made to CT chest from ___.  Opacity overlying the right hemithorax is
 most likely anatomic.  Bibasilar atelectasis correlates with CT.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The aorta is tortuous as seen on
 prior CT chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Technically limited study due to position.  PA and lateral views can be
 considered.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
