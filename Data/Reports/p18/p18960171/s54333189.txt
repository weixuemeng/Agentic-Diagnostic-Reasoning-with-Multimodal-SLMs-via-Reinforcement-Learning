                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain low.  This accentuates the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular structures.  Moderate right pleural effusion has increased
 in size, and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion appears unchanged. 
 Persistent adjacent basilar lung opacities, most likely due to atelectasis,
 although coexisting infectious consolidation is possible in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Diffuse haziness in the imaged upper abdomen corresponds to
 known ascites on prior abdominal CT of ___, which also
 demonstrated marked anasarca.
