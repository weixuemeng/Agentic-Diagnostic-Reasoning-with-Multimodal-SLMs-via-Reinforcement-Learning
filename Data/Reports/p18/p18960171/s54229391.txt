 IMPRESSION:
 
 A left subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. 
 The lung volumes are diminished, and there are now bibasilar patchy opacities
 and probable layering effusions which may reflect compressive atelectasis,
 although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
