                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea in a patient with ovarian cancer.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to assess given the bilateral large pleural effusions
 and bibasilar atelectasis that appear to be unchanged or minimally progressed
 since the prior study.  Upper lungs are essentially clear.  No appreciable
 pneumothorax is currently demonstrated.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is
 most likely present, slightly worse than on the prior examination.
