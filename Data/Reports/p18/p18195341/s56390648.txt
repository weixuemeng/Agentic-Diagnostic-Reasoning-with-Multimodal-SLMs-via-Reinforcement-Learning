                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Head trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Diffuse opacities through both lungs are noted, but may be accentuated by
 supine positionoing and low lung volumes, as there is no correposnding opacity
 in the upper portion of the lungs seen on the conteporaneous c-spine CT.  Low
 inspiratory volumes may  also account for slight prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. The heart is not enlarged.  No supine film
 evidence of pneumothorax identified and no gross effusion.  No apical capping
 is identified.  No rib fracture detected on this lung-technique film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) No evidence of pneumothorax detected.
 2) Diffuse bilateral lung opacities. However, this may be an artifact due to
 technique. If clinically indicated, a repeat CXR in upright position with
 improved inspiration, may help for further assessment.
