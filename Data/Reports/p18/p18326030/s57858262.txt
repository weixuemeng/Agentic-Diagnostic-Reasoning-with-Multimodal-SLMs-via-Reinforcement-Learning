                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and upper abdominal pain.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded with a retrocardiac opacity as well
 as a more subtle opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle. There is diffuse
 increased interstitial markings as well as increased vascular markings with
 upper re-distribution.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Constellation of findings is compatible with a left lower lobe
 pneumonia and possible right lower lobe pneumonia on the background of
 interstitial pulmonary edema.
