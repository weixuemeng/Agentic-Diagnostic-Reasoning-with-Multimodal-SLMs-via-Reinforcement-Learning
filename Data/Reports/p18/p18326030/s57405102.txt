                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with alcoholic hepatitis, status post
 antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and new Dobbhoff placement, here to evaluate
 position of Dobbhoff tube and interval changes in right lower lobe opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a Dobbhoff
 feeding tube coiled within the stomach with the tip terminating in the
 inferior distal stomach.  Small bilateral pleural effusions on the right
 greater than the left with associated compressive atelectasis are unchanged in
 appearance.  The right hemidiaphragm remains obscured and focal consolidation
 at the right lung base with parapneumonic effusion cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff feeding tube coiled within the stomach.
 
 2.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than left
 with unchanged opacification of the right lung base may represent focal
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical context.
