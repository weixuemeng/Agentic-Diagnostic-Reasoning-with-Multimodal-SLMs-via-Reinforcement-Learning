 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  A
 nasogastric feeding tube is seen passing below the diaphragm and extending out
 of view on the frontal image with the tip positioned most likely post-pyloric.
