                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypoxia, recently diagnosed with
 portal vein thrombosis.  Study requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph, abdominal MR and abdominal/pelvic CT from
 ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph, there is increased density
 of the right lower lobe which is likely related to a moderate amount of
 pleural fluid with a subpulmonic component, in combination with known
 abdominal ascites.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is a dense
 paratracheal opacity which likely relates to partial right upper lobe
 collapse.  There are worsening opacities at the lung bases bilaterally which
 could represent atelectasis, aspiration or pnuemonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Worsening opacities at lung bases bilaterally which may represent
 atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia.
 
 3.  New right uper lobe paratracheal opacity, likely due to partial right
 upper lobe atelectasis.
