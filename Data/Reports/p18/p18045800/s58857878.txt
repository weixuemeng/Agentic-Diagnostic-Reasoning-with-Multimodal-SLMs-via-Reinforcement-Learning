 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Patient
 positioning somewhat limits evaluation, though allowing for this, the lungs
 appear clear.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm is noted.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  Deformity of the thoracic spine incidentally noted.
