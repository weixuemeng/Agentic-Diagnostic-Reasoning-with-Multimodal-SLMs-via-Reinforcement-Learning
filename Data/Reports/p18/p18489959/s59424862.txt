                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female intubated-shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior film from earlier the same day.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 3 cm from the carina.  NG
 tube passes off the inferior field of view.  On the current exam, there is
 improved aeration of the left lung base with some persistent opacity seen
 laterally.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  Mild blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle could be due to atelectasis, overlying soft tissues or
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but less so likely due to increased
 lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET and NG tubes as above.  Improved aeration of the left lower lung compared
 to prior with some residual opacity potentially due to atelectasis or
 consolidation.
