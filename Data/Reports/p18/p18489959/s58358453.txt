                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post intubation.  Evaluate tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior studies, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  An endotracheal
 tube terminates in the trachea approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube can only be followed to the lower esophagus and the tip is
 not clearly visualized.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate pulmonary edema
 is stable.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely due to low lung
 volumes and rotation of the patient.  A monitoring device overlies the patient
 and obscures evaluation of the lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in the mid trachea, approximately 3.3 cm above the
 carina.
 2.  Nasogastric tube can be followed to the lower esophagus; however, the tip
 is not clearly visualized.
 3.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
