                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  The heart is
 enlarged, though patient is known to have extensive mediastinal and epicardial
 fat deposition likely also accounting for prominent cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  The lungs appear essentially clear.  No evidence of effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of acute intrathoracic process. Prominent
 cardiomediastinal silhouette likely due to prominent mediastinal and
 epicardial fat deposition as seen on prior CT. Please refer to subsequent CTA
 chest for further details.
