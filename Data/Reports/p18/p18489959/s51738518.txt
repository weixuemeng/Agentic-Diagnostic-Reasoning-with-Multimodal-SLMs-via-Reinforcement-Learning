                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status and hypoxia.  Question
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The mediastinum takes on a globular shape and the cardiac sized is
 increased.  Increased peripheral markings are consistent with edema versus low
 lung volumes.  The left lower hemithorax is completely opacified, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Certainly, pneumonia could also be
 considered in this area, although air bronchograms are not present.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 Old right sided rib fractures and chronic degenerative changes of both
 shoulders are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Opacification of the left lower lung- atelectasis versus
 consolidation versus effusion. PA and lateral views of the chest may help
 further delineating the thoracic process.
