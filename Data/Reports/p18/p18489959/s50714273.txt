 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:12 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Constant appearance of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric
 tube.  The nasogastric tube can now be followed along its entire course, but
 the tip is not included on the image.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with
 blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by mild pleural
 effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema.  No new parenchymal opacities.
