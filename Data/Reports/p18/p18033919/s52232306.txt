                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for pneumothorax.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 If there is a right apical pneumothorax it is very small.  Of note, multiple
 cystic structures seen on recent CT scan at the right lung apex make it
 difficult to assess for pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  No effusion is identified.  2 x 2.5 cm mass in the
 right upper lung is seen in correlates with findings on recent CT scan.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Very small right apical pneumothorax.
