 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right upper lobe mass status post
 biopsy with small apical pneumothorax, evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 16:09.
 
 A portable upright study, ___ at 9:06 is submitted.

 There is a stable approximately 2-cm mass in the right upper lobe.  In
 addition, there are bullous cystic changes at the right apex.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen.  Also, an oval lucency lateral to the known mass in the
 right upper lobe corresponds to cystic change on the recent chest CT dated

 which corresponds to the mass seen on the CT study of ___.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pleural effusions.  No
