                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall fall from standing with syncope, rule out
 pneumonia, pneumothorax, or fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hila
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite fracture is identified.

 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Please note that the
 conventional radiograph is poor at detection of bony injury. Correlation with
 site of pain is recommended and bony detail views may be obtained for further
 evaluation if indicated.
