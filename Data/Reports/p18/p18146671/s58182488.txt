                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma, presenting with respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary
 vasculature.  Generalized interstitial abnormality is mild.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Mild generalized
 interstitial abnormality is likely a chronic finding and should be assessed by
 non-urgent CT.
