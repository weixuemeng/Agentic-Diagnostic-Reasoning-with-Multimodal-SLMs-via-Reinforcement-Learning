                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is similar streaky retrocardiac opacity that can probably be attributed to
 atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, not significantly changed, which suggests
 atelectasis.  No definite evidence of acute disease.
