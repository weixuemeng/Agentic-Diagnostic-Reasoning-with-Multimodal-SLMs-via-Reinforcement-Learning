                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low with associated bronchovascular crowding.  Bilateral
 peripheral opacities are seen, which may represent atelectasis given lower
 lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral peripheral pulmonary opacities, potentially representing
 atelectasis. Repeat radiographs with increased inspiratory effort would allow
 for further clarification as infection is also possible.
