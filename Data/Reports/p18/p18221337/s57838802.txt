 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up opacities seen in prior chest x-ray of ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are persistent bilateral diffuse
 mainly peripheral opacities.  Some of them might represent pleural plaques and
 some appear to be reticular lung opacities.  High resolution CT is recommended
 for further evaluation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
