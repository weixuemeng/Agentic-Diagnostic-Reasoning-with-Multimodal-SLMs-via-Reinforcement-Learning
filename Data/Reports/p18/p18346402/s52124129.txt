 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ? complex seizure  // CXR: eval for
 consolidationCT head: eval forICH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due
 to a small pleural effusion.  Slight increase in opacity over the lower
 posterior lungs on the lateral view may relate to a small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although underline consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Partially imaged spinal rods noted at the
 thoracolumbar junction.
