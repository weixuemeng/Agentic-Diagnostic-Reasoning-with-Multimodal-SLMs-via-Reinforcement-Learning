                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a right apical pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___
 at 22:09.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is a stable, small right
 apical pneumothorax.  Increased opacity at the right base without silhouetting
 of the pulmonary vasculature, right heart border, or right hemidiaphragm
 suggests a new, layering right pleural effusion.  Persistent retrocardiac
 opacity is consistent with unchanged, left basilar atelectasis.  Probable,
 small, new left pleural effusion.  Parallel, linear densities projecting
 medial to the left humeral shaft could represent a displaced humeral fracture
 or superimposition of soft tissues.  Clinical correlation is recommended and
 dedicated left humeral radiographs could be obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable, small right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Probable, new, bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 3.  Parallel, linear densities projecting medial to the left humeral shaft
 could represent a displaced humeral fracture or superimposition of soft
 tissues. Clinical correlation is recommended and dedicated left humeral
 radiographs could be obtained.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider dedicated left humeral radiographs if clinical
 concern for fracture exists.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 09:54 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
