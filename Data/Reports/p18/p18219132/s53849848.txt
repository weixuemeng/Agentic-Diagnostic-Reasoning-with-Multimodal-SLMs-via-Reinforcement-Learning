                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ -year-old female with hypoxia, determine reason for hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 Study is limited by underpenetration due to patient body habitus.  Within this
 limitation, there are low lung volumes noted with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  Bilateral opacifications likely represent dependent atelectasis. 
 Cardiac silhouette appears mildly prominent which may be secondary to
 accentuation by low lung volumes.
