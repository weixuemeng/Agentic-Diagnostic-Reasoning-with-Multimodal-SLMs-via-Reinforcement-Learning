                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive cough  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are faint opacities in both lower lobes, suspicious for aspiration or
 pneumonia.  It is also possible that the left basilar opacity may reflect
 atelectasis in the setting of persistent left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Upper
 lungs are clear.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests
 trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are suspicious for aspiration or pneumonia, potentially
 with superimposed atelectasis at the left lung base.  Trace left pleural
 effusion.
