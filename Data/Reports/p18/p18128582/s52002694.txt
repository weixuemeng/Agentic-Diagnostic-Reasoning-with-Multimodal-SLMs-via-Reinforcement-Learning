                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after bronchoscopy and
 transbronchial biopsy.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to the prior studies, there is redemonstration of the right upper
 lobe process.  There is questionable minimal apical lucency that might reflect
 pneumothorax and should be further followed on the subsequent studies.  There
 is interval development of right basal atelectasis that most likely is
 post-procedural.
