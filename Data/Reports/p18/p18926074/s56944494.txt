                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bladder cancer.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  The pulmonary nodules seen on
 the prior chest CT are better appreciated on the previous chest CT as compared
 to the chest radiograph.  Previously seen right apical nodule is not clearly
 depicted on the current examination, unclear if decreased in size or just not
 projected on the current radiograph.  No new abnormalities demonstrated.
