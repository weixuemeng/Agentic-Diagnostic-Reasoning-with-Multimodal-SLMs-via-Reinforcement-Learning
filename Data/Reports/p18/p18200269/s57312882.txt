                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with tender along left lateral
 chest wall.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs remain clear of consolidation or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is a suggestion of possible
 left lateral rib fractures; however, due to significant overlying soft tissues
 and AP technique, the acuity of these is uncertain.  Dedicated rib series
 could be performed if clinically desired.  There is no pneumothorax.  Osseous
 structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of left rib fractures; however, evaluation is
 limited secondary to technique and patient body habitus.  If desired to
 confirm or to evaluate for acuity, dedicated left rib series is suggested.
