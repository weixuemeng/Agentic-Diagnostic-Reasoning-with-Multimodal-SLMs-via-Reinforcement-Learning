                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Two days after subtotal cholecystectomy with fever
 and oxygen requirement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Patient is essentially rotated.  There is at least moderate amount of right
 pleural effusion and most likely present small amount of left pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomegaly cannot be excluded.  Right perihilar infectious
 process is a possibility.  Repeated radiograph preferably with AP symmetric
 and lateral views is required.  There is no pneumothorax.
