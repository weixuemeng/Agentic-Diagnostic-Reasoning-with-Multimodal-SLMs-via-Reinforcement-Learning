 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC again extends well into the right atrium.  If the desired
 position of the tip is at or just above the cavoatrial junction, the catheter
 could be pulled back by approximately 5.5-6 cm.  Patchy right middle lobe
 opacity is seen, new since the prior study, worrisome for pneumonia.  Left
 lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
