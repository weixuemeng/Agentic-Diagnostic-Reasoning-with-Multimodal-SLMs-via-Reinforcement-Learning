                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PICC for TPN, now pulled back 3cm ___ to PICC in RA  // R PICC in
 RA ? PICC tip s/p 3 cm pullback
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the most recent prior study, there is interval retraction of the right
 PICC line, whose tip now terminates in the proximal right atrium. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable with top normal heart size.
 Persistent obscuration of the right cardiac border is compatible with
 pneumonia.  There is no new focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right PICC now terminating in the proximal right atrium.
 2.  Persistent right middle lobe opacity, consistent with pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Retraction of the PICC by 2 cm is advised for
 repositioning of tip in the low SVC.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ from the
 IV team on the telephone on ___ at 12:19 PM.
