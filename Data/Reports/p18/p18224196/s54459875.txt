                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 08:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Dobbhoff tube in stomach, attempted
 advancement, evaluate for placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 08:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with a mitral valve
 replacement.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this
 postoperative patient.  A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not completely identified on this study.  A right
 internal jugular sheath remains in place, unchanged.  There are bilateral
 effusions, left much greater than right, with associated airspace disease,
 which most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  The interstitium appears somewhat coarsened, but no
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, there has been no
 significant interval change.
