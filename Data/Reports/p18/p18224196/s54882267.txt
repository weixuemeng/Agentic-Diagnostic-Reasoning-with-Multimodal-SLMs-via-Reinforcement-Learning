 Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Pleural effusions have nearly

 pneumothorax.  Left lung base linear opacities are compatible with scarring or
 atelectasis.  A mitral valve prosthesis is noted.  Sternotomy wires are
 intact.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung base atelectasis or scarring.  Near-complete interval
 resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.
