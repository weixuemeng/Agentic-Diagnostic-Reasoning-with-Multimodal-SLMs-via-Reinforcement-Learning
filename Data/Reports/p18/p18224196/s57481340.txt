                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:49 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. 
 Evaluate mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 1:05 p.m.
 
 Since the earliest postoperative study earlier today on ___ following
 median sternotomy and dual-valve replacements, there has been no change in the
 essentially normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left lower
 lobe collapse however has progressed.  Small left pleural effusion is
 presumed.  Right pleural effusion is minimal if any and there is no
 pneumothorax, basal pleural tube in place.  ET tube, midline drains are in
 standard placements.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right descending
 pulmonary artery and should be withdrawn several centimeters to avoid
 inadvertent cannulation of the middle lobe or superior segmental lower lobe
 pulmonary arteries.  No pneumothorax.
