                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increasing cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.  There is
 questionable increasing right upper lobe relatively lateral opacities that
 might reflect developing/resolving infectious process.  The rest of the lungs
 are clear with no appreciable change in hyperinflation.  Minimal bilateral
 pleural effusion is appreciated on the lateral view, new as compared to the
 prior study.
