                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions s/p drainage  //
 r/o ptx      r/o ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a
 much better inspiration.  There is still some enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Probable small
 bilateral effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the left base.
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs raises the possibility of chronic pulmonary
 disease. However, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 The tip of the Port-A-Cath extends to the upper portion of the SVC.
