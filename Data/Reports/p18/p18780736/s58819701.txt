                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CLL  // Increased cough.  Assess for
 pneumonia/abnormality      Increased cough.  Assess for pneumonia/abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion has increased substantially since ___,
 obscuring the left heart border, responsible for left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 .  I cannot say whether the diameter of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has
 increased.  This may be an important consideration regarding possible
 pericardial effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is minimally larger.
 
 Left upper lobe is clear.  Atelectasis at the right lung base is mild.
 
 An indwelling right subclavian infusion catheter ends just above the origin of
 the SVC, unchanged.
