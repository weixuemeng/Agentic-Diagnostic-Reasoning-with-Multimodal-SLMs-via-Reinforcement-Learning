 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT of the chest from

 is noted.  Streaky opacity persists in the left upper lobe which likely
 represents a scarring at the site of previous pneumonia.  No definite effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  Mild compression deformities in
 the mid-to-lower T spine again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Streaky left upper lobe opacity
 likely scarring in the setting of old pneumonia.  Mild central hilar
 congestion.
