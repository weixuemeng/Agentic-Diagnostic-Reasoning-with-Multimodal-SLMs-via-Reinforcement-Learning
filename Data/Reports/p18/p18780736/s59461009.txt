 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval      eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  Bilateral pleural effusions processed, more prominent on the left,
 with atelectatic changes at the bases.  There is increased engorgement and
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with some increasing pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Port-A-Cath remains in place with the tip in the mid portion
 of the SVC.
 No definite acute pneumonia, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed consolidation would be difficult to completely exclude.
