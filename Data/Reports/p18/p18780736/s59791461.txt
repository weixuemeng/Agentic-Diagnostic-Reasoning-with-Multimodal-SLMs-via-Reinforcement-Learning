                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper superior vena cava, as before. Lung
 volumes have decreased.  There are new opacities at the medial lung bases,
 more extensive on the left than right. There are also small but increased
 bilateral pleural effusions, again larger on the left than right. More
 superiorly, bilateral opacities are suggestive of atelectasis. Mid to upper
 lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacities at the lung bases, which are probably due to atelectasis but not
 entirely specific. Infectious process is difficult to entirely exclude.
 Increased but small pleural effusions.
