                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with COPD exacerbation and MSSA
 pneumonia, still intubated, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within
 normal limits.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is observed.  Patient remains
 intubated.  Position of ETT unchanged.  The patient is known to have advanced
 COPD and is now treated for clinically diagnosed exacerbation.  On the
 preceding examination, scattered patchy bilateral basal infiltrates were
 described as having improved slightly since an earlier examination of ___.  A similar comparison of these portable single view chest examinations is
 now performed between the study of ___ and today, ___.  The
 amount of infiltrates and extension appears to have increased slightly.  There
 is, however, no evidence of new discrete parenchymal infiltrates in other new
 areas of the accessible lung fields.
