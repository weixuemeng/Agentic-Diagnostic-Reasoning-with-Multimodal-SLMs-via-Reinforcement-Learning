                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with upper lobe predominant emphysema.  Worsening
 heterogeneous lower lobe opacities are present affecting the left lower lobe
 to a greater degree than the right, and are likely related to the history of
 pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration.
