 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 The right apex is excluded from this study.  An endotracheal tube terminates
 3.7 cm above the carina.  An OG tube terminates within the stomach, with the
 sideport at the GE junction. The heart size is normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  Linear bibasilar opacities reflect
 atelectasis.
