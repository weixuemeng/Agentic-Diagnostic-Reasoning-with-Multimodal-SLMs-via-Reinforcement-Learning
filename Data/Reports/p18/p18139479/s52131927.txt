                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with COPD and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart size is
 normal and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Lung hyperinflation
 is severe with flattening of the diaphragms and right lower lobe lucency
 consistent with a large bulla, similar to prior.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Lung hyperinflation, suggestive of COPD, with unchanged large right lower
 lobe bulla.
