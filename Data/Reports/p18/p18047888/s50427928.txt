                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated and OG tube  // OG and ETT placement?
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous ___ radiographs on PACs record for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Tubing overlies the extreme upper right lung
 apex.
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip lies approximately 2.0 cm above the carina. 
 An OG type tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film.  The  patient is
 status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.  There is a moderately large
 left pleural effusion, which obscures the left heart border and left
 hemidiaphragm and which tracks along the left chest wall and into the left
 lung apex.  The aortic knob is not well delineated, in part due to rotation,
 but also due to the left apical fluid.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains midline.
 
 On the right, there is possible minimal upper zone redistribution.  Patchy
 opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is noted. No frank consolidation is
 identified.  No effusion.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip 2.0 cm above the carina.
 2. OG tube tip beneath diaphragm, off film.
 3. Moderately large left effusion with obscuration of the aortic knob, cardiac
 silhouette,  and left hemidiaphragm.  If there is an appropriate history of
 trauma, this would be compatible with apical capping and would raise concern
 for aortic injury.
 4. Underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 5. Patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic region -- question atelectasis, but
 early infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration cannot be excluded.
 6. No significant CHF or right-sided pleural effusion.
 7. Sternotomy with mediastinal clips, consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
