                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube resides approximately 4.5 cm above the
 carinal. The endogastric tube extends into the left upper quadrant. On this
 supine radiograph, a partially layering moderate in size right pleural
 effusion is present. Given the layering right pleural effusion and increased
 opacity of the right hemi thorax, difficult to exclude a superimposed
 consolidation. The left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly
 unremarkable. Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Satisfactory position of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Increased opacification of the right hemi thorax as compared to the left,
 likely reflective of layering pleural effusion though it difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia.
