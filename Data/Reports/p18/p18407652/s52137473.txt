                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There is patchy
 left base opacity which could relate to atelectasis, although underlying
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, although
 underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Consider dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able.
