                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with IVC placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has
 been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which terminates
 in the mid SVC.  There is no definite pneumothorax.  Lung volumes have
 decreased accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. 
 There has been interval obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be
 related to a combination of low lung volumes and to atelectatic changes at the
 left lung base.  No new focal consolidations are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
