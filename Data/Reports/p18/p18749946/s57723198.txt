                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with lead terminating in the right ventricle. 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  There is mild cephalization of
 the pulmonary vasculature, likely suggestive of mild chronic pulmonary
 congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Several clips are again
 demonstrated within the anterior mediastinum.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Pleural thickening at the right lateral base appears unchanged.  Mild
 elevation the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
