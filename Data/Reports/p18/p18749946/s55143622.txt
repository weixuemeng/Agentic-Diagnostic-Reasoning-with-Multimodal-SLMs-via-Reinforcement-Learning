                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including from ___
 
 FINDINGS: Technique is limited due to underpenetration and positioning.
 Allowing for this limitation, there is no significant change from prioor
 exams, with stable moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral layering effusions,
 right worse than left. No pneumothorax.  An ICD projects over the upper left
 hemithorax with a single lead in the right ventricle, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: Allowing for limited technique, the overall appearance is that of
 the patient's baseline with small bilateral layering pleural effusions, right
 worse than left, and stable severe cardiomegaly.
