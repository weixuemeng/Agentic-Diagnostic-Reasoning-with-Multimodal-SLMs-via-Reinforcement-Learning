                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest
 CTA.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided AICD device is noted with lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The heart remains moderately enlarged. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with calcification of the
 thoracic aorta present.  There is mild pulmonary edema noted, which appears
 minimally worse when compared to the prior study, with continued elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right costophrenic angle, the
 latter of which may represent a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening. 
 No left-sided pleural effusion is present, and there is no pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine, and multiple
 sutures are noted within the anterior aspect of the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Chronic elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may
 reflect a small right pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
