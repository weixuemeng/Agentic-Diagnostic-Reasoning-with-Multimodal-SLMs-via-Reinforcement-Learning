 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:21 PM
  Low lung volumes. No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax identified. Increased
  bilateral opacities with more focal RLL opacity and R perihilar opacities may
  be a combination of edema, atelectasis and aspiration. Contrast from OR
  procedure in stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:20 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with esophageal cancer.  Evaluate possible
 complication of EGD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 10:35 a.m.
 
 Since preceding study, heart size and pulmonary vasculature and the small
 right pleural effusion have all increased in size consistent with cardiac
 decompensation.  That means the moderate increase in mediastinal caliber in
 and above the region of the aortic arch could be due to venous engorgement
 rather than a new fluid collection in the mediastinum.  There is no
 pneumomediastinum and no pneumothorax.  Lungs are clear of any focal
 abnormality.
