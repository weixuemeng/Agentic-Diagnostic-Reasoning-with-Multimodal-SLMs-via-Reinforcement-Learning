                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic esophageal cancer with sepsis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the pulmonary vascularity has
 substantially decreased to about normal level.  Minimal engorgement may be
 present on the right.  Opacification along the superior mediastinum on the
 right is again seen.  An area of increased opacification at the right base
 could well represent merely low lung volumes and scattered radiation related
 to the size of the patient, since there is no silhouetting of the right heart
 border or inner aspect of the hemidiaphragm on this side.
