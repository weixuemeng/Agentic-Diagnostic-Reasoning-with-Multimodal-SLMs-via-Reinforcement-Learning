                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with adenocarcinoma with
 known metastatic involvement of the lungs, currently with leukocytosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The right upper mediastinal stripe thickening is consistent with known
 lymphadenopathy as well as right hilar involvement.  Heart size is stable. 
 There is new opacity in the left mid lower lung, worrisome for developing
 infectious process in this location, most likely in the lingula.  The rest of
 the lungs are unchanged.  There is no appreciable right pleural effusion but
 small left pleural effusion is seen and might reflect parapneumonic fluid.
