 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear very similar with cardiac
 enlargement as well as enlargement of central pulmonary arteries bilaterally. 
 There is a similar mild interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary
 congestion, but the main change is a vague new retrocardiac opacity. There is
 a small pleural effusion on the right but probably unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague new retrocardiac opacity, possibly atelectasis, early pneumonia
 possible.  Mild vascular congestion.
