                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  shortness of breath
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There appears to be
 some bronchiectasis with possible scarring along the medial and right upper
 lung.  The right hilum is also prominent, although there is no prior for
 comparison, may be due to enlarged pulmonary artery.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Suggestion of scarring in
 the medial right upper lung with possible bronchiectasis, correlate with
 history of infection.  The right hilum is prominent, which may relate to a
 prominent pulmonary artery, although underlying lymphadenopathy is not
 entirely excluded.
