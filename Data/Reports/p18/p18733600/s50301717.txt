                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  TIA, possible question intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.  There are
 increased lung markings in the right lower lobe, and it is unclear if this
 represents an early infiltrate or some volume loss.  Attention should be paid
 to this area on followup.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Heart is upper
 limits normal in size.  Minimal degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.
