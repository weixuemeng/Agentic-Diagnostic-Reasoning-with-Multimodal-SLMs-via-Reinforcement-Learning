 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman l basal ganglia hematoma, extending to
 ventricle  // r/o aspiration PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar airspace opacities new compared to the prior study.  Left
 lower lobe atelectasis also noted however the appearances are suspicious for
 aspiration.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which appears
 hazy consistent with a degree of congestive heart failure.  The projection
 precludes assessment of the heart size however prominence of the hila suggest
 a degree of congestive heart failure.  Probable small left pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suspicious for bibasilar consolidation/aspiration.  Background
 changes of mild congestive heart failure.
