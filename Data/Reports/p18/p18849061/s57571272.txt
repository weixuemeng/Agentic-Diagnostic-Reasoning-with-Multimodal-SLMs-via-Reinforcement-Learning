                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chronic ventilation for paraplegia. 
 Evaluate for left port placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, possibly reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is noted.  The heart is normal in
 size.  There is a right PICC which terminates in the distal SVC.  A
 tracheostomy tube appears in appropriate position.  Cervical spinal fusion
 hardware is noted, and midline cervical metallic densities are of unclear
 etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis aspiration.  Pneumonia is a
 possibility, please correlate clinically.
