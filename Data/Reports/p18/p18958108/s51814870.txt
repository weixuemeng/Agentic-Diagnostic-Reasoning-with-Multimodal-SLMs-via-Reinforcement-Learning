 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.0 cm from the carina.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  There is mild perihilar haziness
 and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy opacities in both lung bases as well as in the left upper
 lobe could reflect coexisting infection or aspiration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  There are no displaced
 fractures.

 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
