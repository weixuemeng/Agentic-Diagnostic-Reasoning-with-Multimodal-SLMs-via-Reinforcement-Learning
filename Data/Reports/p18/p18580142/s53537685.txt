                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall from standing with a history
 of a sternal fracture and T12 compression fracture who presents for followup
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.  Chest CT from ___ and T-spine films from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Per CT from ___, the fracture through the mid-sternal
 body is non-displaced. There appears to be increased sclerosis at the
 previously noted fracture line on the radiograph, suggestive of interval
 healing.  The moderate compression deformity of T12 appears unchanged compared
 to the CT from ___ and the radiographs from ___.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is a small
 interval increase in the left lower lobe opacity likely secondary to
 atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear of any focal consolidations. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No new fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval healing of fracture through the sternum.
 
 2.  Stable moderate compression deformity at T12.
 
 3.  Interval increase in left lower lobe atelectasis.
