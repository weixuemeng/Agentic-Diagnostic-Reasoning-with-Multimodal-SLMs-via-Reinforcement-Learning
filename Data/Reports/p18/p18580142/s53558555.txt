                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.  Question sternal fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. 
 There is no pulmonary edema or definite findings to suggest pneumonia. A trace
 left pleural effusion is difficult to entirely exclude on the lateral view,
 but no large pleural effusion is seen.   No underlying pneumothorax is
 present.  There does not appear to be any rib fractures, but not the best
 study for evluatio.
 
 The complete sternal fracture fragments seem to have slightly further
 disassociated since hte prior exam and have definitely been getting more
 displaced since ___. In addition, there are several vertebral body wedge
 compression fractures, most pronounced with a near complete wedging of a lower
 thoracic veterbral body (~T11). Slightly superior to this, there is a further
 compression of the approximately T8 vertebral body when compared to the ___ exam. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Difficult to exclude a trace posterior left pleural effusion, as above,
 but no large pleural effusion.  Clear chest.
 2.  Further dissociation of the sternal fracture fragments since the prior
 exam.  Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures; the worst of these were
 present previously, although in the interval since ___ there is
 continued progressed compression of approximately the T8 vertebral body.
