  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
  costophrenic angle airspace opacities may represent atelectasis or small
  effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly. No focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxemia evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema is similar to the
 prior study.  Airspace opacities in bilateral costophrenic angles may
 represent atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes .  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, including moderate cardiomegaly and a tortuous
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion .  Bilateral costophrenic angle airspace
 opacities represent atelectasis .  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No focal
 consolidation.
