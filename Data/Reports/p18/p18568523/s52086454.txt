                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement, interval change, in a
 patient with aspiration event and subsequent hypoxic respiratory failure,
 transferred for esophageal mass and possible stricture stenting.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and enteric tube extending below the
 diaphragm in off the inferior edge of the image, unchanged in position.  Heart
 size remains normal and the lungs well inflated.  There are diffuse
 parenchymal opacities, some of which are due to costochondral cartilage
 calcification.  However, there is underlying parenchymal abnormality with
 apical scarring.  There is no large focal consolidation or edema.  Moderate
 scoliosis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged chest radiograph, with unclear parenchymal abnormalities and apical
 scarring.  Costochondral cartilage calcification may obscure underlying lung
 disease.  Further evaluation with CT is recommended.
