                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent pacemaker placement and left upper
 extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two transvenous pacemaker leads, continuous from the left pectoral generator,
 are unchanged in position since ___ when they were newly inserted. The
 right atrial lead follows the usual course. The right ventricular lead is
 oriented obliquely upward to the anterior wall of the right ventricle at the
 origin of the pulmonary outflow tract.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion and thickening, are chronic, accounting for
 stable volume loss in the right lung since ___. There is no left pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or mediastinal widening. Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.
 Previous mild pulmonary edema in the right lung has changed in distribution
 but not entirely cleared, and pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change since ___ in non standard position of right ventricular
 transvenous pacemaker lead close to the pulmonary outflow tract.  No evidence
 of complications related to lead insertion.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema persists in the right lung, probably influenced by
 restrictive pleural thickening. Chronic mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
