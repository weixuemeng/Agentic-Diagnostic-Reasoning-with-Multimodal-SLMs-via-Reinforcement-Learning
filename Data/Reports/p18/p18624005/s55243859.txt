                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with past medical history significant for CAD s/p CABG in
 ___, pericardial effusion s/p cardiocentesis, atrial fibrillation c/b pauses
 requiring pacemaker placement in ___, right-sided CHF, tricuspid regurg and
 likely contrictive pericarditis p/w R sided HF  // evaluate pulmonary edema
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, read in conjunction with subsequent chest CT on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly lower and pulmonary vascular caliber has increased
 slightly most recent prior chest radiograph on ___. Mild progressive,
 pulmonary edema in the right lung is largely due to alterations from
 restrictive pleural thickening, following pleurodesis, but there may be a
 cardiogenic component. Mediastinal vessels not particularly dilated. Overall,
 the findings are most readily explained by mild congestive heart failure or
 volume overload, rather than particularly right-sided heart failure or
 constrictive pericarditis.
