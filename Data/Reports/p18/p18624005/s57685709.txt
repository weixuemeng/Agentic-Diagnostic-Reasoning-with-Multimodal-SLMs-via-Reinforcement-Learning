                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // ? pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior exam, there appears to be increasing opacities
 particularly in the right upper lobe which may be related to worsening
 pulmonary edema versus redistribution of the moderately sized right pleural
 effusion. There may be a tiny left pleural effusion. Heart size remains
 normal. The patient is status post median sternotomy as well as CABG and
 mastectomy. Right-sided volume loss remains with shift of the mediastinum
 towards that side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the radiograph from approximately 12 hr prior, there are
 increasing right upper lobe opacities which may be reflective of a
 redistributing moderate size right pleural effusion or increasing asymmetric
 pulmonary edema. Continued right lung volume loss.
