                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and right mastectomy. 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle. Volume loss in the right lung with rightward shift
 of mediastinal structures is re- demonstrated.  Hazy opacification within the
 right lung is more pronounced in the upper lobe compared to the lower lobe,
 and was present on the previous CT, but worse compared to the prior
 radiograph. Small pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening is re-
 demonstrated on the right in this patient who has undergone prior pleurodesis.
 Left lung is clear with a trace left pleural effusion noted. No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung hazy opacification, more pronounced in the upper lobe, was
 previously seen on the prior CT and thought to reflect pulmonary hemorrhage.
 Right pleural thickening and small pleural effusion as well as trace left
 pleural effusion.  No evidence for pulmonary edema.
