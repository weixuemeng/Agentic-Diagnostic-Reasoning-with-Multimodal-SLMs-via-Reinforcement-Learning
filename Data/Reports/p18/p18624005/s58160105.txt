                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with history of breast CA, Hodgkin's, p/w 2wks cough and
 pre-syncope  // Evaluate for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior the common there is apparent increase in size of the
 right-sided pleural effusion. Hazy right midlung opacity is new which could be
 in part due to fluid in the fissure. Right-sided volume loss similar compared
 to prior. The left lung is grossly clear although detailed evaluation is
 limited by motion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam secondary to motion. Right-sided pleural effusion has increased
 in size. Hazy right midlung opacity could represent fluid within the fissure
 although superimposed consolidation is possible.
