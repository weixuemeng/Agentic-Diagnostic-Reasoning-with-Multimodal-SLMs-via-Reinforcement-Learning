                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for PICC position as well as
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  Scattered opacities are seen in the right
 upper lung zone compatible with metastatic disease, which are better assessed
 on prior CT from ___. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A left
 upper extremity PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with atelectasis at the left lung base. No focal
 consolidation.
 2.   Known bilateral pulmonary metastases better evaluated on prior CT chest
 ___ ___.
 3.  PICC terminating in the cavoatrial junction.
