                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post thoracic spinal fixation due to
 spine injury with complicated postoperative course.  Evaluate for interval
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph on ___ and CT chest with contrast
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Vertebral stabilization devices and midline surgical clips are
 redemonstrated, obscuring fine detail.  There has been interval removal of the
 endotracheal and esophageal tubes.  The right-sided subclavian line ends at
 the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  
 
 A layered left sided effusion is again seen with some fluid tracking along the
 minor fissure. The overall decrease in right hemithorax opacification may be
 secondary to decreased effusion versus different patient obliquity during
 imaging. A mild hazinness of the left lower lung field is suggestive of a
 small layering left sided effusion. A dense retrocardiac opacity represents
 postoperative atelectasis, unchanged.  There are no focal pulmonary opacities
 concerning for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Of note, there is
 increased widening of the upper and mid mediastinum along its right margin.
 Cardiac contour is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased widening of the upper and mid mediastinum along its right margin
 may represent paraspinal hemorrhage. Further assessment with CT is
 recommended.
 
 2.  Interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tube.  Spinal
 stabilization devices, surgical clips, and left subclavian line are unchanged.
 
 3.  Layered right sided pleural effusion might be improved. A small layering
 left sided effusion is present.
 
 4.  Stable left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr ___ by Dr ___ on ___ at 11 am
 via telephone immediately after discovery.
