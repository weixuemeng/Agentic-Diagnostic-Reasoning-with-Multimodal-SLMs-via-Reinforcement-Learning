 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal with redemonstration of aneurysmal
 dilatation of the thoracic aorta, similar in appearance to recent two prior

 contours are not well evaluated due to mediastinal widening from aneurysm.  A
 6 mm calcification projecting over upper medial right hemithorax is unchanged.
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mediastinal widening from known thoracic aortic
 aneurysm, not significantly changed in appearance compared to ___.  No
 focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
