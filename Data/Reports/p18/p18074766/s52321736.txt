                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is suggestion of a hiatal hernia.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded. 
 There is mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries, particularly in the left,
 which may be due to pulmonary hypertension.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation.  Unfolded and tortuous aorta with prominence of
 the left pulmonary artery, could relate to pulmonary hypertension, cannot
 exclude prominence/dilation of the aorta which could be confirmed on chest CT.
 2.  Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, possible hiatal hernia.
