                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confirm PICC position placed at an outside facility.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Right PICC is in unchanged position, again terminating in the mid SVC.  Lung
 volumes remain low, with resultant bronchovascular crowding, though there is
 no definite vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Thoracolumbar
 fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Low lung volumes persist.
