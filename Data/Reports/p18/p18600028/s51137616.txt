                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  High fever and abdominal pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating from ___ through
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low which along with AP technique exaggerates the
 cardiac silhouette which remains normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Bronchovascular crowding is attributable to low
 lung volumes without definite vascular congestion or interstitial edema. 
 There is no focal consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pleural surfaces are
 clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive thoracolumbar fixation
 hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
