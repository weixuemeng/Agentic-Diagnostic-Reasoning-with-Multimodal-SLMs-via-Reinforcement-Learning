                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath, ___% oxygen. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Previously present ETT has been removed.  Central
 airways appear free.  Heart size unchanged.  Slightly higher positioned
 diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and result in some crowded
 appearance of the basal pulmonary vasculature, but there is no evidence of new
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral pleural sinuses are free
 from any fluid accumulation.  Heart size is unchanged and there is no evidence
 of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  As
 identified on previous examination, a cerebral-abdominal drainage line is
 overlying the right-sided hemithorax.  A previously identified NG tube curls
 up in the fundus of the stomach as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of new pneumonic infiltrate
 since the next preceding study four days ago.
