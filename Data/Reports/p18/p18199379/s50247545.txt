  air bronchograms could reflect fluid from BAL; although, hemorrhage or
  aspiration could have a similar appearance.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after bronchoscopy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to a prior
 transbronchial biopsy.
 
 There is no interval development of pneumothorax.  There is left mediastinal
 shift that might potentially be related to left upper lobe partial
 atelectasis, correlation with cross-sectional imaging (most likely obtained in
 outside facility) is recommended.
 
 Right basal opacity might represent interstitial changes, chronic.
