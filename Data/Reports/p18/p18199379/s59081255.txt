 Postoperative changes in the left hemi thorax appear similar in this patient
 status post recent wedge resection procedure.  There remains a small to
 moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar lung opacification
 and no visible pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. New focal opacity in
 periphery of right upper lobe could reflect focal atelectasis, aspiration or
 developing infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard appear
