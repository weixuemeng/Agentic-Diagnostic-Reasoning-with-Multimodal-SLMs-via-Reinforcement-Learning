  1.  There is a 0.6 cm nodule in the left upper lobe.  Recommend comparison to
  prior imaging to assess stability. If these are not available for comparison,
  recommend noncontrast CT of the chest for further evaluation.
  
  2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia, as clinically
  questioned.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 2:19 AM
  
  1. There is a 0.6 cm nodule in the left upper lobe.The ___
  pulmonary nodule recommendations are intended as guidelines for follow-up and
  management of newly incidentally detected pulmonary nodules smaller than 8 mm,
  in patients ___ years of age or older. Low risk patients have minimal or absent
  history of smoking or other known risk factors for primary lung neoplasm. High
  risk patients have a history of smoking or other known risk factors for
  primary lung neoplasm.
  
  In the case of nodule size >4 - 6 mm: For low risk patients, follow-up at 12
  months and if no change, no further imaging needed. For high risk patients,
  initial follow-up CT at ___ months and then at ___ months if no change.
  
  2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia, as clinically
  questioned.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chills.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is a 0.6 cm nodule in the left upper
 lobe.  Lungs are otherwise clear, except for bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 There are degenerative changes of visualized spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  There is a 0.6 cm nodule in the left upper lobe, potentially a calcified
 granuloma but not fully characterized by conventional radiographs. Recommend
 comparison to prior imaging to assess stability.  If these are not available
 for comparison, recommend noncontrast CT of the chest for further evaluation.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia, as clinically
 questioned.
