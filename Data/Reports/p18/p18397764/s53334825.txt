                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  A punctate sclerotic focus
 projecting over the intersection of the left fifth posterior and third
 anterior rib is unchanged from prior study and likely represents a calcified
 bone island or granuloma.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
