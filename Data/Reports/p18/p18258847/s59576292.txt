                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with PMH of rheumatic heart disease, severe AS, mild MS,
 severe MR, severe TR, mod AI, PAH, hypothyroidism, CKD (Cr 1.2-1.6), valvular
 afib with RVR, SSS s/p pacemaker placement ___, who presented with fluid
 overload. On ___ developed pleuritic chest pain  // please eval for
 infection, fracture, or other abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 There is a dual lead pacemaker, with lead tips over right atrium right
 ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but similar to prior.
 
 Of note, there is marked lucency at the right and left lung apices.  While
 this could represent artifact in a the patient with attenuated vessels/COPD, 
 on the left, the lung edge appears visible.  However, the appearances similar
 to the ___ radiograph and targeted review of the chest CT from ___ is more suggestive of an area of apical pleural thickening with
 overlying calcification (series 11b:  Image ___ from that study).  .
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD., with
 background parenchymal scarring.  Previously seen CHF appears markedly
 improved.  Again seen is a small left effusion, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.  Minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and patchy opacity previously seen at the right lung
 base medially is improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, but doubt overt CHF.  Previously seen CHF findings are
 markedly improved.
 2. Small left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation is similar
 to ___.
 3. Right base changes are also improved, with only a small residual pleural
 effusion.
 4. Marked lucency at both lung apices, of uncertain significance.  This is
 probably artifactual due to a combination of apical pleural thickening and
 attenuated vessels.  No definite pneumothorax.
 5. No displaced rib fracture identified on these lung technique films.
