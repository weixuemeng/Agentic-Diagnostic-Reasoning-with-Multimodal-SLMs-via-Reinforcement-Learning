                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  History of rib fractures, now new injury to the anterior right
 lower rib, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no compelling
 evidence of a right rib fracture on the current images.  However, chest
 radiograph is limited for assessing the ribs and, if the clinical changes
 persist without other explanation, a dedicated rib series should be performed.
 
 No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions, normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
