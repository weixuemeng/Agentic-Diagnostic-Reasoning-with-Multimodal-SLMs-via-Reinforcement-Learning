                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left sided chest pain and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Prominence of the hila bilaterally could suggest
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries or underlying lymphadenopathy.  There
 are diffuse interstitial opacities bilaterally, most pronounced along the
 periphery, which is concerning for chronic interstitial lung disease.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with diffuse interstitial opacities bilaterally suggestive of
 a chronic interstitial lung disease.  Bilateral hilar prominence could reflect
 pulmonary arterial enlargement or underlying lymphadenopathy.  Further
 assessment with CT is recommended if not done previously.
