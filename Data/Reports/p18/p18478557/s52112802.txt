 HISTORY:  Hepatorenal syndrome with possible worsening pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Continued rotation of the patient with unchanged
 appearance of the mediastinum.  Indistinct and engorged pulmonary vasculature
 is again consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  There is
 opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. 
 This suggests developing pleural effusion with associated compressive
 atelectasis.
