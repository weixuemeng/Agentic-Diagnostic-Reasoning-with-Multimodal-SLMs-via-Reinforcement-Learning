 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent hip fracture
 currently hypotensive.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  The right
 PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The patient continues to be rotated
 with unchanged appearance of the mediastinum.  There is interval development
 of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, new that might potentially explain the
 patient's symptoms.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion, although small
 amount cannot be excluded.
