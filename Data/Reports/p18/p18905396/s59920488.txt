                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoglycemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy
 opacities are seen in the lung bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
