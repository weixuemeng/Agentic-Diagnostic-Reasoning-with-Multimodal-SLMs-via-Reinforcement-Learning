                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post trauma with chest pain, here to evaluate for rib
 fractures or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 18:15 p.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are mildly displaced fractures of the left lateral fourth and
 seventh ribs with subtle non-displaced fractures of the left lateral sixth rib
 and left posterior ___ and 11th ribs.  There is no definitive evidence of
 pneumothorax.  A focal airspace opacity in the left mid lung zone is
 compatible with pulmonary contusion.  There is a small amount of pleural fluid
 tracking towards the left lung apex.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple acute left-sided rib fractures as detailed above with
 left pulmonary contusion and pleural fluid, but no definite pneumothorax.
