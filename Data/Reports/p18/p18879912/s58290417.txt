                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, pre-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Again there is hyperexpansion of
 the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with substantial
 chronic pulmonary disease in a patient with previous sternal wires, CABG, and
 aortic valve replacement.  Dense calcification is again seen in the mitral
 annulus.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles probably reflects pleural thickening.
