                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C cirrhosis, interstitial lung disease, dyspnea.
 
 CHEST:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  When compared to the prior chest x-ray, however,
 there has been clearing of the interstitial patten on the left side, but
 perihilar opacification on the right persists, which may indicate a
 concomitant pneumonia.
