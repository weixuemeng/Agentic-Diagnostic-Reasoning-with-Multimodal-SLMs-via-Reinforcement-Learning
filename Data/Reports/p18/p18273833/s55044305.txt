                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion again noted, similar
 compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis but infection is difficult to exclude.  Right mid lung field
 peripheral opacity appears unchanged compared to the prior study and is
 nonspecific, potentially an area of infection.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Multiple calcified gallstones are again seen within the right upper quadrant
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little interval change compared to the prior study.  Persistently low lung
 volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis but
 infection is difficult to exclude.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right
 peripheral mid lung field opacity may reflect an area of infection or
 infarction, but is nonspecific.
