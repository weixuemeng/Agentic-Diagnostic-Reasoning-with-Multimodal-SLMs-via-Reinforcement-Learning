                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of liver disease with worsening
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Exam is extremely limited secondary to
 extremely low lung volumes.  That said, there has been significant interval
 change since prior with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings and possible
 more confluent consolidation at the right lung base.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  Rounded calcific density in the right upper quadrant compatible
 with calcified gallstones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extremely low lung volumes.  Increased interstitial markings in lungs
 bilaterally right greater than left when compared to prior suggestive of
 edema.  More confluent opacity of the right lung base raising possibility of
 superimposed infection.
