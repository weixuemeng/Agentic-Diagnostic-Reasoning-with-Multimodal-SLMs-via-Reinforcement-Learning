                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with hypoxia, improving decreased fluid
 in fissure?
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Poor inspirational effort explains high
 positioned diaphragm obscuring major portions of the heart shadow.  Crowded
 pulmonary vasculature on the bases is explained by this poor inspiration.  In
 addition, there are still remaining plate atelectases bilaterally.  Pulmonary
 vasculature pattern is less congested, and the degree of perivascular haze is
 less marked.  This coincides with lesser prominence of the previously
 increasing fluid accumulation in the minor fissure.  No new pulmonary
 abnormalities are seen, and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of chest findings with less marked congestive pattern
 indicative of successful dehydration.
