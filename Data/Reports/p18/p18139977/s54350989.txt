                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic kidney disease with new chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large-bore dual-lumen dialysis catheter is in stable course and
 position from a right internal jugular approach.  Lung volumes are diminished.
 No consolidation or edema is evident.  There is hemidiaphragm flattening
 suggestive of underlying obstructive lung disease.
 
 Aortic tortuosity is again noted but stable.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 within normal limits for size.  There is subtle blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle posteriorly which may indicate a small effusion.  No large
 effusion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative disease is
 seen in the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underlying COPD.  No definite superimposed acute process.  Stable
 dialysis catheter.
