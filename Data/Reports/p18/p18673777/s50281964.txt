                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of congestive heart failure, worsening
 bilateral lower extremity edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly appears relatively unchanged compared to the
 previous study.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, but is
 slightly improved compared to the previous radiograph.  Small amount of fluid
 is seen within the fissures, but no large pleural effusion is present.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.  Again noted is a high riding right
 humeral head suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the previous
 radiograph.
