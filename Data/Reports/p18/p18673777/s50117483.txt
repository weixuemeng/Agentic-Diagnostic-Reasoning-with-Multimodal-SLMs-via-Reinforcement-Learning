                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/f stroke  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the cardiac silhouette
 mildly enlarged.  There is subtle increased interstitial markings bilaterally,
 with basal predominance, suggesting chronic interstitial lung disease, mild
 underlying interstitial edema not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Slight increase in opacity at the right lung base may
 relate to chronic lung disease, however, underlying aspiration is not
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle increase in interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally, with basal
 predominance, suggest chronic interstitial lung disease, mild underlying
 interstitial edema not excluded.  Slight increase in opacity at the right lung
 base may relate to the aforementioned chronic lung disease, however,
 underlying aspiration not excluded.
