 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.    Lung volumes are low.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted.  There is subtle blunting of the left CP angle
 suggesting a tiny effusion or pleural thickening.  The lungs appear clear
 without focal consolidation or edema.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour
 is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  Partially imaged spinal hardware is
 again noted in the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with tiny left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.  No
 findings to account for acute chest pain.
