                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with MS and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation is appreciated
 on this limited view.  A small left pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.  Compared to prior exam, there is decreased prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC. 
 Exam is otherwise unchanged.  Slightly prominent loops of air-filled colon are
 again noted under the right hemidiaphragm.
