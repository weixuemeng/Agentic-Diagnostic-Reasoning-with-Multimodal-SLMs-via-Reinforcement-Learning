                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A vague
 opacity projects over the right mid-to-upper lung on the frontal view only and
 is more conspicuous compared with the prior exam, differential considerations
 include pneumonia versus overlying artifact.  Otherwise, no definite
 consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  Interposition of bowel accounts for the
 lucency below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the right mid-to-upper lung, question early
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
