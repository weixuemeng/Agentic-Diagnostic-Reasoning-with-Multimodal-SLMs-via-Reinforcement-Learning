                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with recent pneumonia with persistent cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest dated ___, chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Residual left lower lobe opacity likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis in
 this patient with recent pneumonia.  Please note a component of residual
 infection is difficult to exclude.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Residual left lower lobe linear opacity likely represents atelectasis though
 cannot exclude a component of pneumonia.
