                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o metastatic NSCLC p/w fevers  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip at the lower SVC. Vague
 nodular opacities project over the right mid and lower lung not definitely
 changed from prior.  Focal nodular opacity at the retrocardiac region abutting
 the descending thoracic aorta again seen. Other bilateral pulmonary nodules
 detected by CT are not clearly delineated by chest x-ray. Slightly enlarged
 hilar contour compatible with adenopathy particularly on the right is
 unchanged from prior. There is no definite superimposed acute process.  There
 is increased density over a lower thoracic vertebral body compatible with
 known metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 Bilateral pulmonary nodules compatible with patient's known metastatic disease
 noting evaluation for subtle change would be best performed by CT. No definite
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
