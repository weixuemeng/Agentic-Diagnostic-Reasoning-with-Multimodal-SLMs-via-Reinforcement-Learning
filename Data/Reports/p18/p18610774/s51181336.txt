                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Stage IV lung cancer with clinical concern for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Known pulmonary
 nodules are poorly visualized, though a subtle nodular opacity is seen in the
 right perihilar region.  Please note nodules are seen in the lung apices
 imaged with the CT C-spine from today.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. 
 Osseous metastatic disease involving the right second rib better appreciated
 on the concurrently performed CT C-spine.  No definite fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Metastatic disease, poorly visualized with subtle nodular opacity
 in the right mid lung.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Osseous metastatic disease,
 better seen with concurrently performed CT C-spine involving the right second
 rib.
