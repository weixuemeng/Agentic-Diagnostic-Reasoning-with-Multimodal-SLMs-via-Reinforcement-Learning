                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with right pneumonia in ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 The remains of previous multifocal pneumonia, could be atelectasis alone.  I
 would delay any followup imaging for at least six weeks given how slowly
 patients with emphysema clear pneumonia.  The only focal pulmonary
 abnormalities are small area of peribronchial infiltration in the right middle
 lobe, and linear scarring in the lingula.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size
 normal.  No pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
