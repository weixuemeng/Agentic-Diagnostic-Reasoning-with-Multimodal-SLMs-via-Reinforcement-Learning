 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.

 the right middle lobe or the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Linear
 opacity in the right mid lung zone is compatible with atelectasis.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with a tortuous aorta.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in either the right middle or lower lobe consistent
 with pneumonia.
