                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia on ___ with increased
 fatigue.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Vague opacity at the right
 lung base is seen and projects over the hemidiaphragm on the frontal view.  It
 is not clearly identified on the lateral view.  Linear opacity is seen in the
 left mid lung suggestive of atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. 
 There is no effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy right basilar opacity at the right lung base, unchanged from
 prior, potentially atelectasis; however, infection is not totally excluded. 
 No new region of consolidation or evidence of failure.
