                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right rib fracture and right pneumothorax. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest and rib films as well as CT scan from earlier the same day.
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right apical pneumothorax is again
 seen.  Given difficulty identifying pleural line on a similar projection on
 prior films, delineation for subtle interval change is difficult.  Given
 differences in technique and positioning from prior CT, there is no definite
 change.  The right pneumothorax certainly does not appear smaller and may be
 stable.  Opacities in posterior costophrenic sulcus on the lateral may be due
 to atelectasis given the low lung volumes.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures
 are as previously detailed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite interval change in right-sided pneumothorax with details as above.
