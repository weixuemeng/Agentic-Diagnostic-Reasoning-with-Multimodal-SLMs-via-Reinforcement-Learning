                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
 appropriately positioned right chest tube with small residual right apical
 pneumothorax, unchanged from the prior radiograph.  Otherwise, the lung
 parenchyma is clear with small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased lung
 volumes with improvement of bibasilar atelectasis.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged since the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right apical pneumothorax with improved lung
 volumes and improved bibasilar atelectasis.
