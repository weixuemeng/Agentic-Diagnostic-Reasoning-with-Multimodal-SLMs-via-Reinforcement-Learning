                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax status post chest tube removal and insertion at
 secondary site.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:07 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right chest
 tube with the side port overlying the right lung parenchyma.  There has been
 interval improvement in the right-sided pneumothorax with only a small
 residual pneumothorax present.  The lung volumes remain low, accentuating the
 cardiac contour and pulmonary vasculature.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are seen. Right basilar atelectasis is again noted.  Minimal subcutaneous
 emphysema at the right chest wall is likely due to insertion of the chest
 tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriate position of right-sided chest tube with interval
 improvement in right apical pneumothorax.
