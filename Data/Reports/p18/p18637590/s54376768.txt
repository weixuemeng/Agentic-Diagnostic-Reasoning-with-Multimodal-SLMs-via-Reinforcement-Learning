                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right pneumothorax, waterseal,
 check size.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  Position of the
 right-sided chest tube is unaltered.  Again the right-sided minimal residual
 pneumothorax is barely visible.  Airation of lung tissue, mild elevation of
 right-sided diaphragm appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  Thus, no evidence of any increase of the
 barely detectable minimal right-sided pneumothorax.
