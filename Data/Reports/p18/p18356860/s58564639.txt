                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Lower left heart border
 and a small portion of the left hemidiaphragm adjacent to this region are
 obscured, possibly due to a prominent pericardial fat pad.  No definite areas
 of corresponding consolidation are observed on the lateral view.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Subtle opacity at left cardiophrenic angle likely reflects a prominent
 pericardial fat pad.  A focal pneumonia in this region is less likely but
 followup radiographs may be helpful if warranted clinically, particularly in
 the absence of older radiographs for comparison.
