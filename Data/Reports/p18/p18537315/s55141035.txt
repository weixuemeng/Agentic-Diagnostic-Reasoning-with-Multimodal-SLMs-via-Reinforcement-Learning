                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cellulitis  // ro chf, dvt left
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  Slight blunting of the bilateral posterior
 costophrenic angles suggests trace pleural effusions.  Minimal interstitial
 edema may be present.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Partially imaged small soft tissue calcification along the superior lateral
 right humeral head could relate to calcific tendinopathy.  Degenerative
 changes are seen at the bilateral acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions and possible minimal interstitial edema.
