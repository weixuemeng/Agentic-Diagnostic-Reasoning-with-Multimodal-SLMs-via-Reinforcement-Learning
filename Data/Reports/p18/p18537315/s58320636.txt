 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea, question CHF.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval resolution of the previously seen mild pulmonary edema.  Small
 residual bilateral effusions, left greater than right.  Streaky linear opacity
 at the left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No
 focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Calcification of the aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  No acute bony abnormality.  Degenerative
 changes in the thoracolumbar spine.
