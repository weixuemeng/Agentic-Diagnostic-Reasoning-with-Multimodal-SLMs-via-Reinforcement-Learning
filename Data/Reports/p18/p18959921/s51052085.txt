                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent Crohn's flare and Humira (___)
 with subsequent interstitial infiltrates, fever and cough.  // Evaluate known
 pulmonary infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are multiple bilateral lung opacities, which appears most prominent in
 the left lower lobe. These likely correspond to the consolidations that were
 described on the prior CTA Chest dated ___, and do not appear to be
 significantly changed in appearance since then. There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions. The heart size is mildly enlarged. No acute osseous
 abnormalities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent multifocal parenchymal opacities, with subpleural and peribronchial
 distribution suggestive of Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia. Although it is
 overall similar in appearance compared to the prior CT scout image, a repeat
 CT would be more sensitive for detecting subtle changes.
