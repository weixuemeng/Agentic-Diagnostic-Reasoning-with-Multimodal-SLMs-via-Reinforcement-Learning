                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain and nausea.  Evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from outside facility ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The bulk of the stomach is herniated into the right hemithorax and
 massively distended with air. Compared to the scout radiograph on the ___
 Torso CT from ___, the distension of the subdiaphragmatic
 portion once equally severe has improved a little after placement of enteric
 tube ending in the debris filled distal stomach in the left upper quadrant.
 The abrupt tapering of the subdiaphragmatic stomach, the absence of bowel gas
 more distally in small or large gut, and the interim emptying of colonic gas
 indicate obstruction in the region of the pylorus, by stricture, volvulus,
 adhesion, abscess, or mass.
 
 Aside from the right lower lung atelectasis due to the herniated stomach, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The thoracic aorta is calcified and tortuous. Cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary hypertension are well depicted in the Torso CT.  Vascular clips in
 the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No free gas in the upper abdomen.
 2.  Severe outlet obstruction of largely herniated, severely distended
 stomach.
 3.  Some decompression over 6 hours by indwelling esophagogastric tube of the
 abdominal portion of the stomach.
 4.  Cardiomegaly, pulmonary hypertension.
 5.  No pneumonia or other evidence of aspiration.
