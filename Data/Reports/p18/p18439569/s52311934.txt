                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal, please assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a
 right-sided chest tube without development of pneumothorax.  Right-sided
 central venous catheter is stable with tip at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Interval resolution of
 previously noted mild vascular congestion as well as decreased bibasilar
 opacification likely reflecting atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Improved aeration of both lungs with resolved
 pulmonary edema and decreased atelectasis.
