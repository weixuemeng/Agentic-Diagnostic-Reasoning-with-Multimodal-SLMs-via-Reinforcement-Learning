                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___ at ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes remain low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is central pulmonary vascular congestion
 though no overt interstitial edema.  No large pleural effusion is evident. 
 There is no confluent consolidation or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Air fluid levels identified in the
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with possible central pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt interstitial edema.  No consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
 Multiple air fluid levels in upper abdomen better characterized by subsequent
 abdominal CT.
