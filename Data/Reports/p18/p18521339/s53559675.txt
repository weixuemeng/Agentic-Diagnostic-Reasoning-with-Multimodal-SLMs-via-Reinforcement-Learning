 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough for two and a half weeks,

 is the absence of any significant wall calcifications in this generally
 widened and elongated aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No
 signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the
 apical area.
