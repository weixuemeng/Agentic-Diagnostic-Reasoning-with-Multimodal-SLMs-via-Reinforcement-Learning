 not significantly changed and terminates within the expected location of the
 gastric body.  There is improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases. Right
 supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter terminates at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Inferolateral aspects of the bilateral lungs are
 excluded from the field of view, but the visualized pleural surfaces appear
 normal.
