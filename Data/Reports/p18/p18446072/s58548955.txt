                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new onset atrial fibrillation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with
 minimal atherosclerotic calcification noted at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged. Streaky opacities are seen in the lung bases,
 potentially reflective of atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted.  No pneumothorax is present. Multiple remote right-sided rib fractures
 are present. Soft tissue calcifications adjacent to the superolateral aspects
 of both femoral heads may reflect calcific tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
