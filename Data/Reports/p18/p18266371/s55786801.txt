 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic thyroid carcinoma, now primary lung cancer.
 Evaluation of interval change.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The extensive right lung changes, including enlargement of the hilar
 structures and the peripheral 4 cm parenchymal opacity are constant.  Also
 constant is the presence of a mild to moderate right pleural effusion.
 
 On the left, there is unchanged evidence of a retrocardiac atelectasis but the
 left lung is otherwise unremarkable.  Status post resection of the sixth left
 rib and healed fracture of the sixth left rib.  Normal appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette.
