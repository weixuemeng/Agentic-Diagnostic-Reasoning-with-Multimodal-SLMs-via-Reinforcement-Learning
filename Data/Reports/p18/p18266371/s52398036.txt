                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of SVC, question effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A PICC line is present.  The tip is obscured by overlying soft tissue
 findings, but appears to overlie the SVC/RA junction or upper RA. No
 pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 There is dense opacity in the right mid zone, which is progressed compared
 with ___.   A right base effusion is also new.  The right chest tube has
 been removed in the interim.  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the left lung is probably grossly
 unchanged, with upper zone re-distribution and basilar atelectasis and a
 possible small left effusion.  Rib deformity in the upper left chest likely
 relates to prior thoractomy or, less likely, an old rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of right chest tube, with new large opacity in the right
 mid-zone and new or increased right base effusion.  Much of the mid-lung
 opacity may represent fluid layering in the minor fissure, as suggested on a
 CT scan from ___.
