                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ and a CT chest
 from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic colon cancer with increased nausea, vomiting,
 abdominal pain, assess for acute intrathoracic process or free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A Port-A-Cath is
 noted projecting over the right chest wall with catheter tip in the expected
 location of the right atrium.  There is plate-like atelectasis in the left
 lung base.  The lungs otherwise appear clear bilaterally, though lung volumes
 are slightly low.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No
 signs of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  The imaged
 osseous structures appear intact.  There is no free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left base plate-like atelectasis.  Port-A-Cath tip in the
 right atrium.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
