                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multi trauma.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New hazy opacification of the right hemithorax likely represents a combination
 of new parenchymal opacity and layering fluid.  New small left pleural
 effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is evident on this view.  There is possibly
 new pneumomediastinum.  Heart size is within normal limits.  The stomach is
 distended with air.  Metallic densities projecting over the left upper
 quadrant likely reflect recent splenic embolization.   
 
 Right rib fractures are better seen on recent prior CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New right parenchymal opacity and pleural effusion, possibly secondary to
 aspiration and/or edema.
 
 2. Possible new pneumomediastinum.  CT could be performed for more definitive
 evaluation. 
 
 3. Distended stomach.
