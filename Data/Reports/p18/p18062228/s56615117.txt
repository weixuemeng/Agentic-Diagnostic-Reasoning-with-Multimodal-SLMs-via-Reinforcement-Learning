  Dense left retrocardiac consolidation is concerning for pneumonia, although
  would be better evaluated with standard PA and lateral views.  Streaky right
  lung base opacity most likely represents atelectasis.  Small left pleural
  effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with febrile neutropenia  // pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Lung volumes are relatively low. 
 Multifocal pulmonary opacities are present in the left mid and both lower
 lungs, and are most confluent in the left retrocardiac region.  Although at
 least a component of the opacities may be due to atelectasis,an evolving
 infectious pneumonia should be considered.  Left pleural effusion is small.
