                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with angioedema secondary to lisinopril with
 new white blood cell count and increased thick sputum from endotracheal tube. 
 // Please assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position compared to the prior study. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with prominence of the bilateral hila,
 prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary vascular also noted consistent with
 congestive heart failure.  There is an airspace opacity in the right lung base
 potentially reflecting pulmonary edema versus infection.  No pleural effusion
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with congestive heart failure, no overt pulmonary edema
 however a new airspace opacity at the right lung base may reflect developing
 pulmonary edema versus infection.
