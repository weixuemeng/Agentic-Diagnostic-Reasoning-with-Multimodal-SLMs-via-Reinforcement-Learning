                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with angioedema secondary to lisinopril with
 new white blood cell count and increased thick sputum from endotracheal tube. 
 // assess for infection vs edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated, an endotracheal tube is unchanged in appearance
 compared to the prior study.  There are increased bilateral hazy opacities of
 the lung bases most consistent with pleural effusions.  These appear to have
 increased when compared to the prior study.  There is associated increased
 opacity of the bilateral lung bases, likely reflecting pulmonary edema however
 infection cannot be excluded.  Prominence of the bilateral hila is less marked
 than on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions have increased when compared to the prior study. 
 Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect pulmonary edema versus
 infection.
