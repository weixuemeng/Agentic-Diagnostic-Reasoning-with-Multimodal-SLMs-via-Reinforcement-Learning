 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis and cholestasis, mild hypoxemia, rule out pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  In addition, there is moderate
 cardiomegaly and small retrocardiac atelectasis.  A plate-like atelectasis
 might also have developed in the left perihilar areas.
 
 The nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval.  No other monitoring
 and support devices.  No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion.
