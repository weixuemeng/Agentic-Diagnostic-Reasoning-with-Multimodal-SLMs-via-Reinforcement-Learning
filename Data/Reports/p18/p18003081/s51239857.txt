                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but
 no pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities may
 reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  Repeat PA and lateral views with
 improved inspiratory effort may be helpful for further assessment of the lung
 bases.
