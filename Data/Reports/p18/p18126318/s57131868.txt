                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma. 
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  The tips of the costophrenic angles
 are excluded from the frontal projection. No bony fractures are detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.
 2. No fractures detected. This technique is not optimized for evaluation of
 osseous trauma; dedicated rib films with localizing markers can be obtained if
 there is a clinical concern for fracture.
