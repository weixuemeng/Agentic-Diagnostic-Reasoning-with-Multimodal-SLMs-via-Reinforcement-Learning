                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Linear opacity projecting over the right mid
 lung likely represents atelectasis.  The visualized portions of the cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes appear normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected on this single view.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement
 is noted.  Pacing hardware appears similarly positioned compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular engorgement without radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia on this single frontal view.
