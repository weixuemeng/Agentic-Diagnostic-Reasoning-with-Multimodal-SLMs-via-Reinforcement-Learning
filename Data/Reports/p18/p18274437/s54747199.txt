                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Quality of the images is very limited due to underpenetration
 likely owing to body habitus. The lungs are poorly inflated, but there are no
 focal opacities. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process although study limited by
 underpenetration.
