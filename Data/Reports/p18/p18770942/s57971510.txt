                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain.  Question perforation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderate-to-severely enlarged with globular
 configuration.  This could relate to cardiomyopathy, but pericardial effusion
 could yield this appearance as well.  There is upper zone redistribution of
 enlarged indistinct pulmonary vessels, suggesting mild to moderate edema.  The
 retrocardiac space in the left lower lobe is under-penetrated and accordingly
 difficult to assess, although not necessarily abnormal.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion on the right; it is difficult to assess for one on the left. 
 There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Dilated cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion should be considered as possible etiologies.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3.  No evidence for free air.
 
 4.  Limited visualization of the left lung base owing to portable technique
 and underpenetration associated with attenuation of soft tissues. 
 
 If physical findings or other concern referred to the site, then follow-up
 radiographs could be considered, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if
 possible.
