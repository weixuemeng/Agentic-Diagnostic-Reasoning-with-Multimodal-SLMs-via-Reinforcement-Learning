                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of nasogastric tube terminates in the upper stomach, but side
 port is in close proximity to GE junction and could be advanced a few
 centimeters to ensure placement distal to this location.  Other indwelling
 devices are unchanged in position, and aortic stent graft appears similar to
 previous radiographs.  Stable mild cardiomegaly accompanied by mild
 interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion as well as persistent
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No visible pneumothorax.
