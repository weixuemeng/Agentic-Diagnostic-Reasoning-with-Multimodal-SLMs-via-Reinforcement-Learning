                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:41 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after thoracic aneurysm repair.  Check NG tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Feeding tube is looped in the upper stomach.
 
 Lateral aspect of the right chest is excluded from the examination.  The other
 pleural surfaces are unremarkable except for possible small left pleural
 effusion unchanged.  Previous large right pleural effusion has resolved or at
 least decreased substantially.  Heart size is normal.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion persists in the left lung, but I doubt that there is edema.  Aortic
 graft is unchanged in position and the heart is normal size.  ET tube and
 right subclavian and a right internal jugular line are all in standard
 placements respectively.  No pneumothorax.
