                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including mild cardiac enlargement with a left ventricular configuration.  An
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear view.  There is a
 nodule or focus projecting over the mid portion of the thoracic spine. 
 Although, an artifact is suspected, it may be appropriate to perform further
 imaging to reassess. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Perihilar nodular focus projecting on the lateral view, probably an
 artifact associated with hilar structures.  However, when clinically
 appropriate, repeat imaging including a lateral view may be helpful to see
 whether it were to persist.
