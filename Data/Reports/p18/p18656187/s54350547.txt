                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with atrial fibrillation, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities
 are noted in the lung bases.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Right PICC catheter tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely
 reflective of atelectasis, however infection or aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
