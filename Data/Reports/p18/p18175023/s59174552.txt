                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough and GI symptoms, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is no focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Ill-defined nodular densities projecting over the right anterior third rib are
 of uncertain etiology.  Calcified right paratracheal and right hilar lymph
 nodes suggest prior granulomatous infection.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  Partial calcification of the aortic knob is
 redemonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Calcified right paratracheal and hilar lymph nodes similar to the prior
 study suggest prior granulomatous infection.
 3.  Nodular opacities projecting over the right anterior third rib should be
 further evaluated with shallow oblique views of the chest.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 4:05
