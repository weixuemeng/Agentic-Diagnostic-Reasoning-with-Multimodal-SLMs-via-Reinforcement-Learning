                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, now with
 dyspnea, here to evaluate for evidence of heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate right pleural effusion with associated
 opacification of the right lung base suggesting underlying atelectasis or
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely
 represents trace pleural fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is essentially within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated due to obscuration of the right heart border by the
 right basilar process.  Within this limitation, the heart is likely top normal
 in size.  Calcification of the aortic knob is noted.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pleural effusion with underlying right basilar
 atelectasis or consolidation. Small left pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema.
