                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Query lung nodule at the left base.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.  Thyroid
 ultrasound ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Plate-like atelectasis at the left base is
 resolved with no evidence of nodule.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Again seen is a slight rightward tracheal
 deviation, indicative of a nodule in the left thyroid lobe.  Correlating to
 thyroid ultrasound from ___, this likely corresponds to the dominant
 left mid-to-lower pole nodule, for which biopsy was recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of left basilar atelectasis with no nodule.
 2.  Rightward tracheal deviation, likely corresponding to nodule seen in the
 left thyroid lobe on thyroid ultrasound from ___.  Biopsy was recommended at
 this time, but these results are not available in the patient's record.
 Continued followup for this nodule is recommended if clinically indicated.
