                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with alcohol intoxication and hypoxia.  Evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A 2.7 x 2.6 cm rounded structure is
 noted in the right mid paramediastinal region which appears slightly increased
 in size compared with prior exam.  Although, this may represent the main right
 pulmonary artery a hilar lesion cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the
 cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  There is no cardiomegaly.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent right paramediastinal nodule may represent a prominent
 vessel versus a hilar mass.  Further assessment with chest CT is recommended.
