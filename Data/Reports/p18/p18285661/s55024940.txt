 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are hyperinflated suggesting possible underlying COPD.  Heart
 size is normal, aorta is tortuous and calcified, and note is made of
 enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries raising the possibility of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No concerning focal or diffuse pulmonary
 opacities are identified.  Minimal linear areas of scarring or atelectasis are
 present in the right perihilar and left basilar regions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of COPD with possible associated pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs
 for more complete evaluation when the patient's condition allows.
