                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumomediastinum, question esophageal perforation.  Repositioning
 of endotracheal tube.  Check for right upper lobe reexpansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:43 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to one hour prior, there has been interval repositioning
 of the endotracheal tube with the tip located 5.5 cm above the carina. There
 is persistent collapse of the right upper lobe, though slightly improved
 compared to prior study.   The left lung is clear.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There remains slight widening of the hilar and
 mediastinal silhouette with pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas tracking
 cranially in the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval repositioning of endotracheal tube now in standard positioning
 with persistent but improved right upper lobe collapse.
 
 2.  Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas in the neck similar to immediate
 prior.
