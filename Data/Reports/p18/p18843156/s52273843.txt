 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, intubated.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm from the carina in standard placement.  Left PIC
 line ends in the upper right atrium, 7 cm below the level of the carina, and
 would need to be withdrawn 3.5 cm to reposition it in the low SVC, if desired.
 Worsening consolidation in the left lower lobe could be pneumonia, aspiration,
 or most likely atelectasis.  Atelectasis is mild at the right lung base and
 there may be small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Heart
 mildly enlarged but unchanged.  No pulmonary edema.
