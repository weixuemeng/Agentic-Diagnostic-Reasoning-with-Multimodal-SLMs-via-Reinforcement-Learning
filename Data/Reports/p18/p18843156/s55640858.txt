  Persistent trace pneumomediastinum.  Right upper lobe collapse has
  substantially improved compared to.  Earlier study.  There is mild platelike
  atelectasis.  In the right mid field as well as linear right base atelectasis
  with a small amount of fluid tracking along the minor fissure.  A small
  subpulmonic right-sided pleural effusion is largely unchanged.  Endotracheal

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumomediastinum, evaluation after bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after
 bronchoscopy.  The pre-existing right upper lobe atelectasis has almost
 completely resolved.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is 4.5 cm above the
 carina.  Minimal residual atelectasis at the bases of the right upper lobe and
 at the bases of the right lung.  No other parenchymal abnormalities.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.
