                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible tuberculosis or sarcoid.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, some of which may be due to relatively low lung volumes.  No
 evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Specifically, no definite hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.
