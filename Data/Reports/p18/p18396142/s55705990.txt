                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with CHF, now with hypotension and
 bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the abdomen demonstrate diffuse interstitial
 pulmonary edema consistent with CHF.  A left base opacity is seen which may
 represent edema or possibly infection.  Tracheal deviation to the left is
 suggestive of a goiter.  This could be verified with a followup thyroid
 ultrasound.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema consistent with CHF.  Left base
 opacity which may represent edema or infection, and will require followup
 imaging as pulmonary edema resolves to rule out infection.  Possible thyroid
 goiter, suggest followup with thyroid ultrasound.
