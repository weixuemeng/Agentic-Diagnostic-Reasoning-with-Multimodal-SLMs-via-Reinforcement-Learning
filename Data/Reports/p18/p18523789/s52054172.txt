                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p cabg  // eval right lung      eval right
 lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the atelectatic changes at
 the right lung have cleared. There is some increased opacification at the left
 base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and possible small effusion.  Otherwise, little change.
