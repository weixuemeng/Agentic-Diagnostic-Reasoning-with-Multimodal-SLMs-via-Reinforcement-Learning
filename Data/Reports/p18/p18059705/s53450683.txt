                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Worsening patchy and linear opacities at both lung bases, which
 could potentially be due to evolving aspiration pneumonia accompanied by
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion is new since the recent CT.  There
 is no visible pneumothorax.
