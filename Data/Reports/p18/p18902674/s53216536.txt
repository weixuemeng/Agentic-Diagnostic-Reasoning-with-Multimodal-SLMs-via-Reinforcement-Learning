                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS s/p fall, evaluate for fracture or bleed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  There is a right lower lobe patchy opacity with
 associated signs of volume loss including inferior displacement of the minor
 fissure and right hilum.  Otherwise, lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity with associated volume loss suggesting at least a
 component of atelectasis.  Coexisting aspiration or pneumonia are not excluded
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiographs would be
 helpful to document resolution.  .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to
 document resolution right lower lobe opacity.
