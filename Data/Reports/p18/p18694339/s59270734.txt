  1. 0.9 cm left lower lobe opacity may represent nipple shadow or pulmonary
  nodule. Repeat radiograph with nipple marker is recommended.
  2. Prominence of left pulmonary hilum is new since previous examination and
  may represent lymph node enlargement.
  3. Of note CT is more sensitive than chest radiograph in the assessment of
  pulmonary metastases.
  4. No definite pneumonia.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. A 0.9 x 0.3 cm opacity is seen projecting over
 the left lower lobe and may represent nipple shadow or a pulmonary nodule.
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Enlarged left pulmonary hilum is new since
 previous examination.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and right hilum are
 unremarkable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are within normal limits and
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  0.9 cm left lower lobe opacity may represent nipple shadow or pulmonary
 nodule.
 2.  Enlarged left pulmonary hilum is new since previous examination and
 worrisome for lymph node enlargement. Consider dedicated CT for further
 characterization.
 3.  No definite pneumonia.
