 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed, which terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There is unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  An orogastric tube has been passed into the stomach.  There is some
 widening between the aortic contour and trachea with the esophageal tube
 coursing in between.  Probably this will return out to be within normal
 limits, and could be seen with a tortuous aorta or prominent mediastinal fat,
 but the possibility of aortic pathology cannot be excluded.  Bilaterally,
 there is perihilar opacification, most suggestive of mild fluid overload or
 congestion, although other etiologies such as aspiration or pneumonia are not
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widened appearance of the mediastinum which may be an artifact,
 but correlation with history is recommended and if there is potential clinical
 concern for acute aortic pathology or other mediastinal pathology, then CT
 imaging could be considered.  Perihilar fullness suggesting vascular
 congestion.
