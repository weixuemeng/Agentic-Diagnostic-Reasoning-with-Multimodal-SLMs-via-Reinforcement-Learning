                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachypnea, rhonchi  // Eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity is most compatible with atelectasis, difficult to
 exclude an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Elsewhere lungs
 are clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis versus an early
 pneumonia.
