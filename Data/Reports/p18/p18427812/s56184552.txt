                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post fall yesterday with right sided rib pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study is limited due to the patient's chin projecting over and obscuring
 the apices as well as patient rotation. Within these limitations, heart size
 is likely top normal. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. The hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable. Patchy right basilar opacity is poorly
 assessed on this exam, but may reflect an area of infection or atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is identified.  No displaced fractures
 are seen, but please note that assessment of the right-sided ribs is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam. Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis or
 infection.  No displaced rib fractures seen, but assessment of the right-sided
 ribs is limited on this study. Please note that a dedicated rib series can be
 obtained for further assessment.
