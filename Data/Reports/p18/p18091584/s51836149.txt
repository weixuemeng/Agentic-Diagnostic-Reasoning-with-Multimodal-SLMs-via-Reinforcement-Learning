                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Epigastric pain, history of lap band, assess for free air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are seen which give the appearance of
 bronchovascular crowding and limit assessment, but no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable with normal heart size.  Lap band is not well evaluated due to
 technique, but appears to be normally oriented on the accompanying abdominal
 radiographs
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  No free intraperitoneal air
