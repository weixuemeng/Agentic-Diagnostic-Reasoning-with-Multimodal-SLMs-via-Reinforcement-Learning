                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina,
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned to terminate in the distal right
 pulmonary artery, nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm, and midline
 drains and bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pleural line
 to suggest pneumothorax.  However, the right hemidiaphragm contour is
 unusually sharp and the right upper quadrant appears slightly hyperlucent, a
 finding that could potentially indicate a basilar pneumothorax.  Attention to
 this region on followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard. 
 Cardiomediastinal widening has slightly decreased since the prior
 postoperative radiograph in this patient with history of aortic dissection
 repair.  Moderate layering left pleural effusion is present as well as left
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
