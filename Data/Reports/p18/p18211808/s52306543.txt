                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen. 
 Mild prominence of interstitial markings could reflect elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
