                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG and AVR.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Widened mediastinum has improved.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are stable with adjacent atelectasis left greater
 than right, unchanged from the prior study allowing difference in positioning
 of the patient.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
