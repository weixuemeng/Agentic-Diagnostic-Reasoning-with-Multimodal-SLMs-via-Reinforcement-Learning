 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, fever  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary process.  If symptoms persist,
 consider repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level to more fully
 evaluate the lung bases.
