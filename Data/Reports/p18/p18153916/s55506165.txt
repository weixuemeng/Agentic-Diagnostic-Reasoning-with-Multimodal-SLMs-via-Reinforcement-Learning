                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent fevers despite
 antibiotic treatment for complicated E-coli urinary tract infection with
 crackles in right lung, evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's physical condition required examination in sitting
 semi-upright position using AP, frontal, and left lateral views.  There is
 moderate cardiac enlargement.  There is a relative prominence of the left
 ventricular contour and moderate enlargement of the left atrium which bulges
 posteriorly on the lateral view.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and
 elongated and calcium deposits are noted in the wall mostly at the level of
 the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution
 pattern and considerable perivascular haze on the lung bases.  This coincides
 with some mild blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses, all
 consistent with some mild-to-moderate degree of chronic CHF.  On the right
 base, some linear densities are consistent with peripheral atelectasis.  There
 is no evidence of any discrete local pneumonic infiltrate.  As there exists no
 prior chest examination available for comparison, it is difficult to determine
 whether the right-sided basal lung changes present peripheral atelectasis with
 poor ventilation of a congested lung or if additional inflammatory infiltrates
 exist.  If clinically important, a followup examination in a few days could be
 useful.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement and signs of mild-to-moderate degree
 of chronic CHF.  Questionable acute infiltrates on the right lung base, but no
 discrete pneumonia identified.
