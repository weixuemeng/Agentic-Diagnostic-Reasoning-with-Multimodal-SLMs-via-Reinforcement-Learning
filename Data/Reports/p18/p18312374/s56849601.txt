                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with minimal
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Subsegmental bilateral lower lung atelectasis
 is noted.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart is mild to moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  Blunting of the bilateral
 posterior costophrenic sulci, appreciated on the lateral projection, could
 reflect small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interstitial pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly and
 probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
