                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Question acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged. A trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the
 left, none on the right. There is patchy opacity in the right lower lung,
 probably in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe but not necessarily
 changed, chronicity unclear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity at the right lung base, not necessarily representing an acute
 process; scarring or atelectasis may explain the appearance although pneumonia
 is hard to exclude.
