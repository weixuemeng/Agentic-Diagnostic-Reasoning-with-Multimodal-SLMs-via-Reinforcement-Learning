 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  eval ett  // intubation

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a small left pleural effusion has
 developed. There is subsequent atelectasis at the left lung base. On the
 right, an effusion is minimal, with minimal increase of radiodensity of the
 right lung parenchyma.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Mild fluid overload
 but no overt pulmonary edema. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
