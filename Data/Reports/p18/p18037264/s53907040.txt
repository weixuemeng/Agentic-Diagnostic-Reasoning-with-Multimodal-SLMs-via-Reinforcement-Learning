 in the distal esophagus and advancement is also recommended.  Endotracheal
 tube and right IJ line are in appropriate positions.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right lung base opacity, concerning for atelectasis and/or
 developing pneumonia.
 2.  Persistent left lung base opacity, pattern more suggestive of atelectasis
 with accompanying pleural effusion.
 3.  Nasogastric tube side-hole is in the distal esophagus.  Advancement is
 recommended.
