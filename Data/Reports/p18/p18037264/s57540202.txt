 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // ett placement      ett placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the new endotracheal tube ends about 6 cm above the carina.
 Nasogastric tube has its side port above the esophagogastric junction with the
 tip out of view. There has been some worsening of the bilateral interstitial
 pulmonary edema and vascular congestion since the previous study. Increased
 opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower
 lobe and pleural effusion.
