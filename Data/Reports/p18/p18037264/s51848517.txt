                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ett  // ett placement.      ett placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube is
 difficult to see, though it appears to be about 5.5 cm above the carina.
 Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in
 left lower lobe with overlying pleural effusion. Heterogeneous opacification
 at the right base is concerning for developing pneumonia.  Otherwise little
 change.
