                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable semi-erect chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea  // assess for interval change,
 pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to ___ study findings have overall improved.  However,
 multifocal bilateral alveolar consolidations are stable when compared to
 ___ study and is likely expected given interval extubation.  There is
 questionable increase of consolidations of left lower lung versus atelectasis
 but could be exaggerated secondary to low lung volumes.  Heart size is top
 normal though likely stable given exaggeration of heart size from low lung
 volumes.  Left port is unchanged in positioning with the catheter tip
 terminating in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Grossly stable multifocal bilateral alveolar consolidations when compared to
 ___ study.
