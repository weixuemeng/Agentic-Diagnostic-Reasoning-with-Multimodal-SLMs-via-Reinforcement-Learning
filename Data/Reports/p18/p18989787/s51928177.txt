                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Malignant melanoma and history of recurrent pleural effusion, now
 presenting with leukocytosis and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The appearance is very similar to the prior examination with marked
 lobular circumferential pleural thickening in the right hemithorax.  Aeration
 of the right lung appears perhaps mildly decreased, probably corresponding to
 increased volume loss, although a superimposed process or rapid progression of
 disease may explain the small change.  The left lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening of opacification of the right lung, otherwise no
 significant change.
