                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta cannot be evaluated.  The cardiac silhouette
 is obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  Small right probably
 loculated effusion and opacities in the right lower lobe have increased. 
 Opacities in the right lower lobe could be worsening atelectasis, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The left lung is clear.  Patient
 has known emphysema.  Severe pleuroparenchymal scarring mainly in the right
 apex is better seen in prior CT.
