                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube placement with a new elevated white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains
 in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Opacification at the right
 base is consistent with some combination of residual pleural effusion,
 atelectasis, and supervening consolidation.  The remainder of the study is
 unchanged.
