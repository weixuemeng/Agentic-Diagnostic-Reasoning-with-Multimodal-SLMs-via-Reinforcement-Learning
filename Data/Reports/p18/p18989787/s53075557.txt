                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Small right pleural effusion appears slightly increased compared to the
 previous exam with worsening right basilar opacification.  No left-sided
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Scarring within the lung
 apices is re- demonstrated as are emphysematous changes.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is noted.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of small right pleural effusion with worsening right
 basilar opacification, likely reflective of compressive atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.
