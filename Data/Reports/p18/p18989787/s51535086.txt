  Chest tube no longer overlying the right lower lung zone.  Not present in the
  field of view.  No pneumothorax.  Linear luncency obliquely oriented over the
  right mid lung is likely a skin fold.  Increasing opacification at the right
  base may be from reaccumulation of pleural fluid, atelectasis or some mild
  focal reexapansion edema.  Results discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:05 PM on
  ___ via telephone by Dr. ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion with chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest
 tube has inadvertently been removed.  No evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural fluid and
 atelectasis and possibly some mild focal re-expansion edema.
