                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness, recent bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There are patchy streaky opacities
 in the right upper lobe as well as in the left lower lobe, worrisome for
 infection or aspiration.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
