                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and elevated lactate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged, with leads
 again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Irregular reticular opacities again project over each central lung region,
 without significant change.  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests
 a very small pleural effusion.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Moderate
 emphysema is present.  Confluent subpleural opacity along the posterior chest
 on the left probably suggests nodular pleural thickening.  Calcified pleural
 plaques could be seen with prior asbestos exposure.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.  The findings are quite similar to earlier radiographs from
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings similar to prior radiographs showing asymmetric
 reticulation and pleural thickening in the left lung.  Persistent small
 left-sided pleural effusion.  Please note recent PET-CT findings suggesting
 that the pulmonary findings are worrisome for malignancy.  Differential
 considerations include mesothelioma, primary lung cancer, or pleural-based
 metastases.
