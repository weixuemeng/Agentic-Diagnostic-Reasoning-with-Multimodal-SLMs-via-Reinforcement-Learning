                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left chest tube
 removal.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 After removal of the left chest tube, there is small left apical pneumothorax.
 The left basal opacity appears to be more pronounced on the current study than
 on the prior examination and may be consistent with atelectasis.  Small amount
 of fluid is noted.
 
 Mediastinal silhouette as well as cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Pacemaker
 leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 Scarring in the right apex is unchanged.
