                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain radiating to the back.  Assess for pneumothorax or
 free intraperitoneal air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Small left pleural effusion is
 seen with accompanying left basilar atelectasis.  There is no right pleural
 effusion or focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax with mild biapical
 pleural thickening.  The heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal
 contours with dual lead pacemaker noted in conventional position.
 
 Small left apical opacity projecting along the inferior border of the clavicle
 may represent combination of apical scarring and overlying structures,
 however, recommend AP lordotic view for further evaluation. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  
 2. Left apical opacity may represent combination of apical scarring and
 overlying structures, however, recommend AP lordotic view for further
 evaluation.
