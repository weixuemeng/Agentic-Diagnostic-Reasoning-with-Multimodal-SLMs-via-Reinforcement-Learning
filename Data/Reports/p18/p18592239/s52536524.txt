                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is hyperexpansion of the
 lungs suggesting some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  The prominence of
 interstitial markings at the bases again raises the possibility of some
 atelectasis and scarring.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists. 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 Of incidental note is a vascular shunt in the right upper zone.
