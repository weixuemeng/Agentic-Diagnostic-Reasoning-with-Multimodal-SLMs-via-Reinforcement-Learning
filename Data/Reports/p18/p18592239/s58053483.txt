                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Transplant, on immunosuppressive with chest discomfort.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the area of pneumonia at the
 right base has cleared.  There are mild areas of opacification at both bases,
 which most likely represent some combination of atelectasis and scarring. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists, possibly relating to pleural
 scarring.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or cardiomegaly. 
 Subclavian stent is seen on the right.
