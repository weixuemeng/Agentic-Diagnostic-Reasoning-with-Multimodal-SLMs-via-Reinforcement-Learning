                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, chills, cough - being treated for
 COPD exacerbation at SNF without resolution of symptoms  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place.  There is hyperinflation consistent with
 background COPD. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including mild cardiomegaly
 and prominence of the superior mediastinum, is unchanged compared with ___. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring,
 without other evidence of CHF. There are patchy opacities at both lung bases.
 Possible minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, but no gross
 effusion identified. Again seen is calcification along the left chest wall,
 possibly sequela from old hemothorax. Multiple clips again noted in the upper
 abdomen.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. STABLE CARDIOMEGALY AND MILD VASCULAR PLETHORA.
 2. BIBASILAR PATCHY OPACITIES LEFT-GREATER-THAN-RIGHT. THE POSSIBILITY OF AN
 EARLY PNEUMONIC INFILTRATE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.
