                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are probably normal considering portable technique and low lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Density obscuring the
 left costophrenic angle may be explained by soft tissue attenuation.  The
 lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
