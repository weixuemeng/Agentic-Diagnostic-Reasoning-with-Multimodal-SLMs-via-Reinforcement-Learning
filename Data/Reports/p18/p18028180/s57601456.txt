                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated
 but essentially clear.  No definitive consolidation to explain patient's
 symptoms demonstrated.  Slight increased diffuse interstitial opacity is
 unchanged and might reflect evidence of prior smoking, if such history
 present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
