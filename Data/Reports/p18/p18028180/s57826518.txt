                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of lymphoma, shortness of
 breath.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is present.  Unremarkable size of thoracic aorta
 with few semi-linear calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of acute
 or chronic parenchymal infiltrates.  As observed on the previous examination,
 there are relatively low positioned diaphragms that are somewhat flattened,
 coincide with slightly hypertranslucent lung bases.  This finding is
 suggestive of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings within normal limits.  Unchanged mild
 degree of findings consistent with COPD.
