                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, now with back and
 chest pain.  Rule out acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP semi-upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are again low, corresponding with vascular crowding.
 New perihilar opacities and prominence of the mediastinal veins correspond to
 acute vascular engorgement given that they appeared overnight. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is stable.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acute vascular engorgement of both hila and mediastinal veins but
 no frank edema.
