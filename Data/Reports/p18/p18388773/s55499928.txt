                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p MVC, high speed Tbone with central C-spine,
 t-spine TTP, mild chest TTP  // eval ? traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Slightly low inspiratory volumes.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is slightly unfolded.
 
 There is mild patchy opacity at the left base, which could represent
 atelectasis or early changes due to aspiration.
 
 Otherwise, no focal infiltrate identified.  No CHF, effusion, or pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 Mild irregularity of the right second rib laterally is noted, but could
 represent an old injury.  Otherwise, visualized ribs are grossly unremarkable.
 
 Note is made of nonvisualization of the supraclavicular companion shadow as
 well as soft tissue opacity in the adjoining fat.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small patchy opacity at the left lung base, question atelectasis or focus of
 aspiration.
 
 Mild irregularity of the right second rib laterally.  Unless there is focal
 tenderness in this area, this likely represents an old, healed fracture.
 
 Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.  Mild unfolding of the aorta
 noted.
 
 Opacity in the left supraclavicular fat and effacement of the left clavicular
 companion shadow.  Correlation with physical exam to exclude supraclavicular
 lymphadenopathy or other soft tissue mass cannot location is requested.
 
 Please note that this examination is not adequate for evaluation of the
 cervical or thoracic spine.  In addition, correlation with specific sites of
 chest wall tenderness may also be helpful for assessment.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Opacity in the left supraclavicular fat and effacement of
 the left clavicular companion shadow.  Correlation with physical exam to
 exclude supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or other soft tissue mass cannot
 location is requested.
