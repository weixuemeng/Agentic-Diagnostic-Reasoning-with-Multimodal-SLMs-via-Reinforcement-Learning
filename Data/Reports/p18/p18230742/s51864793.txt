                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Food bolus stuck and proximal esophagus status post dilatation
 and failed removal.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The lung volumes are
 low.  In the mid mediastinum there is an air-fluid level which probably refers
 to dilatation of the esophagus.  Streaky atelectasis is noted at the lung
 bases but no definite pleural effusion.  No mediastinal air is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Air-fluid in the distal esophagus but no visualization or radiodense foreign
 body.
