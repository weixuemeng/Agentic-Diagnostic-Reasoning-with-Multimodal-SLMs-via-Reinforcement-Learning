                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent colectomy presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ as well as
 multiple noncontrast chest CTs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The study is limited by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours appear stable.  There are
 small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The stomach and small bowel loops appear dilated with multiple
 air-fluid levels in appearance suggestive of ileus although the abdomen is
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.  Bilateral small effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 2. Bowel gas pattern is suggestive of postoperative ileus although the abdomen
 is only partially imaged.
