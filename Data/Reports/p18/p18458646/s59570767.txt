                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with shortness of breath after FFP, eval pulmonary edema or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 Lung volumes remain low with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  An area
 of increased opacity is present in the right middle lobe with obscuration of
 the right heart border.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  The left
 lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right middle lobe opacity likely secondary to low lung volumes
 and non-cardiogenic edema, but may reflect a developing consolidation.  This
 area will need attention on follow-up radiographs.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
