                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:27 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ischemic colitis after sigmoid colectomy. 
 Increasing confusion and agitation, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, so atelectasis is to be expected, nevertheless the
 large region of consolidation at the base of the left lung raises concern for
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is new.  Opacification of the
 infrahilar right lower lobe is more readily identified as atelectasis. 
 Interval increase in heart size is a function of the positioning, there is no
 pulmonary edema or mediastinal vascular engorgement.
