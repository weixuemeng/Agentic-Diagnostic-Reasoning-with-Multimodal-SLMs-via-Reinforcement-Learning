                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia and recent respiratory infection as well as history of interstitial
 pneumonitis.  Compare to prior study.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next previous PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  Heart size and appearance of thoracic aorta
 including mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No evidence of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates is
 present, and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence
 of new acute pulmonary parenchymal or pleural abnormalities, and no evidence
 of pneumothorax in the apical area.  On previous examination identified minute
 peripheral plate atelectasis on the left base has resolved.  Very mild degree
 of degenerative changes is seen in the thoracic spine vertebral body
 anteriorly.  They have not progressed significantly.
 
 Our records include multiple previous chest CT examinations, the most recent
 dated ___, ___, ___, ___
 and again ___.  Previously identified scattered ground-glass
 densities were shown, but these are two subtle to be identified conclusively
 on the plain chest examinations.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of significant cardiac enlargement, CHF, or acute
 pulmonary infiltrates.
