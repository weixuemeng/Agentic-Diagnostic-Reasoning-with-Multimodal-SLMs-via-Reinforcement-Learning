                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness breath, evaluate for pneumonia or
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior examinations, there is interval worsening of right
 lower lung opacification with silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Findings are most compatible with a right pleural effusion with adjacent right
 lower lobe consolidation, likely relaxation atelectasis, however infectious
 consolidation cannot be excluded by radiograph.  A subcentimeter right upper
 lobe calcified granuloma is unchanged from multiple prior exams, better
 assessed on prior chest CTs.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila
 are stable.  There is no left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lung opacity is progressed since most recent prior chest x-ray,
 likely representing right pleural effusion with adjacent relaxation
 atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
