                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with epigastric pain and
 interstitial lung disease..
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a background of chronically increased interstitial markings.  There
 is increased heterogeneous density in the left lower lobe which is likely
 secondary to atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
 pneumothorax pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal. Degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular joint are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definitive evidence of pneumonia. Left lower lobe opacity likely secondary
 to atelectasis but early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
