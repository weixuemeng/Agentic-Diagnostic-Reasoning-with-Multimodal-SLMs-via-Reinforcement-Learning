                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. 
 The hila are unremarkable.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded, particularly
 within the left lung base.  A trace left pleural effusion may be present.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, which may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Possible trace
 left pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes.
