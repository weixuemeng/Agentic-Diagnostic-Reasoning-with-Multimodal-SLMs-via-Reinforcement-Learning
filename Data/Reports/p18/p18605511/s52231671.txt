                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, cough  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Additionally, the patient's arm overlies the lateral images, obscuring the
 view.  No focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The prior fracture/
 injury of the proximal left humerus is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation.  Limited lateral views due
 to the patient's overlying arm.
