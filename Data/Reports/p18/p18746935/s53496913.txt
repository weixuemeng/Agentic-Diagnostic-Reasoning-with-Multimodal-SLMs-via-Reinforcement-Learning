                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w low sats, cough, fevers  // ? pna      ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Prior vascular congestion in the lungs and mediastinum has resolved, and lungs
 are well expanded.  There is a fine granular abnormality in the right midlung
 on the frontal view, probably in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
 I can't be sure if it was present on the low resolution AP supine portable
 chest radiograph postoperatively on ___, and we do not have
 preoperative chest radiographs so I do not know if it is acute.  However this
 could well be pneumonia, especially vertically due to aspiration when supine.
 Atelectasis in the lingula could also be contributing to cough, but probably
 not fever.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Heart is normal size.  There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible right lower lobe pneumonia.  No evidence of cardiac decompensation.
