                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension and pulmonary edema with worsening hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pulmonary
 vascular congestion has essentially cleared.  Poor definition of the left
 hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.  No
 acute focal pneumonia.
 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed.
