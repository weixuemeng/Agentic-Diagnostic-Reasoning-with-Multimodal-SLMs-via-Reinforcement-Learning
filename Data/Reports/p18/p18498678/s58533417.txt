                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypoxia, now postoperative status
 post total knee replacement, unable to be extubated, evaluate for aspiration
 versus atelectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  The patient is still intubated, the ETT terminate in
 the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  The heart appears
 markedly enlarged.  This is possibly accentuated by the AP technique and the
 markedly recumbent position of the patient.  The pulmonary vasculature is very
 hazy and there exist bilateral mostly centrally located parenchymal
 infiltrates, most likely representing acute pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax
 can be seen.  No other indwelling tubes are seen.
 
 In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___,
 only mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement exists at that time, and there were
 no signs of acute pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient is intubated.  Pulmonary findings and cardiac enlargement
 indicative of severe CHF with pulmonary edema.  Referring physician, ___
 ___ was paged at 4:40 p.m.
