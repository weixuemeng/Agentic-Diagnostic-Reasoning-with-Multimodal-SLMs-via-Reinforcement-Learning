                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Flash pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An ET tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is again seen.  The lungs are underinflated, resulting
 in bronchovascular crowding.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 interstitial edema are improved since ___.  There is improved
 aeration of the upper zones in comparison to the 5:18 a.m. study performed
 today.  There is no pneumothorax.  A persistent left lower lobe opacity may
 represent pleural effusion and/or atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Improved mild interstitial edema and central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 2.  Improved upper zone aeration.
 3.  Appropriately positioned ET tube.
