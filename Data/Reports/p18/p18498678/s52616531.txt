                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___:55 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with acute diastolic CHF.  Now with fever and
 tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, and distention of mediastinal venous and pulmonary and
 hilar vessels suggest worsening heart failure.  Left lower lobe is obscured,
 probably poorly aerated, whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis is
 radiographically indeterminate.  As yet pulmonary edema has not returned, and
 volume of presumed bilateral pleural effusions is probably not significant.
