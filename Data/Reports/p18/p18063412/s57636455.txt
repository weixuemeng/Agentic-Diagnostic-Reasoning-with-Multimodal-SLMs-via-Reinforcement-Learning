                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, night sweats, myalgia and new atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Subsegmental atelectasis is noted within the right
 lung base.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may suggest a
 trace pleural effusion or scarring.  Left lung is clear.  No left-sided
 pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunting the right costophrenic angle may suggest a trace pleural effusion or
 scarring.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
