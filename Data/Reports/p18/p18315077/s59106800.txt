  1. The endotracheal tube terminates in the upper trachea. The tube can be
  advanced 3-4 cm to terminate in the mid thoracic trachea, if desired.
  2. Opacity in the right lower lung appears increased. A part of this may be
  related to technique, but layering pleural effusion and/or atelectasis may
  also contribute.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT withdrawn  // ETT positioning      ETT
 positioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube is
 approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. It could be pushed forward about 3 cm.
 Right IJ sheath remains in place.
 There is increased opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural
 fluid and collapse of portions of the right middle and lower lobe.
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe.
