                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dysarthria.  Evaluate for infection.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Accounting for difference in inspiratory effort, severe cardiomegaly is
 similar to the prior exam.  Pulmonary vascular markings are likely accentuated
 by low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes.
 2.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.
