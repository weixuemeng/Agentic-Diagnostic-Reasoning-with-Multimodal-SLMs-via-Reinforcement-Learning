 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p esophagectomy with desaturation  // please
 evaluate for interval change      please evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left IJ catheter is been
 removed. No definite pneumothorax is appreciated. The remainder of the study
 is essentially unchanged except for an area of increased opacification in the
 left upper to mid zone, which is worrisome for superimposed aspiration or
 pneumonia.
