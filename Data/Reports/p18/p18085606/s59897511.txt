                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 outside hospital performed the same day and chest x-ray from ___. 
 There is a retrocardiac opacity which appears somewhat more conspicuous thanon
 exam from earlier the same day.  There is also blunting of the left lateral
 costophrenic angle.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings are seen
 throughout, particularly at the right lung base.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is grossly unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, potentially due to atelectasis given
 interval progression since earlier the same day however component of infection
 or effusion is also possible.  Increased interstitial markings throughout the
 lungs most notably at the right lung base potentially due to low lung volumes
 however component of fluid overload is also possible.
