                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at approximately 7:00 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is improved aeration at the left lung base with persistent
 retrocardiac opacity, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Pulmonary
 vascular prominence with minimal interstitial haze may be secondary to mild
 fluid overload.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Heart size appears mildly
 enlarged, which may be exaggerated by AP technique and slightly low lung
 volumes.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration at the left lung base with persistent retrocardiac
 opacity, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
 2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Viral or atypical infection may also
 have this appearance.
