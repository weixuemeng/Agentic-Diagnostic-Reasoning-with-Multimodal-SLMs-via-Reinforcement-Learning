 Lungs appear somewhat diminished in volume with streaky opacities at the bases
 likely reflecting scarring or subsegmental atelectasis in this patient with
 known emphysema. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or
 aspiration at this time. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable. Previously reported pulmonary nodules on
 CT ___ are not well appreciated on the plain radiograph. Prominent
 hilar contours which are stable and may reflect a combination of prominent
 vascular structures and known lymphadenopathy. Clips in the right axilla
 consistent with prior axillary node dissection secondary to the known
 diagnosis of breast cancer.Surgical clips are again seen in the epigastric
 region.
