                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to previous chest x-ray of ___ and CT chest of ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  New pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema.  Patchy and linear
 opacity at left lung base favors atelectasis over infectious consolidation. 
 Small pleural effusions are present.  Follow up radiograph after diuresis may
 be helpful to document resolution of the interstitial opacities and exclude
 the less likely possibility of infection.
