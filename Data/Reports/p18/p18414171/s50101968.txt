                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of CHF with worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Slightly lower lung volumes
 seen on the current exam.  Streaky right mid-to-lower lung opacities are again
 seen, suggestive of scarring.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen
 throughout.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.  Degree of
 cardiomegaly has not changed.  Prosthetic aortic and mitral valve prostheses
 are noted.  There is a compression deformity in the lower thoracic spine which
 was not present on prior and is age indeterminate.  Enlarged main pulmonary
 artery again seen compatible with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with a small right pleural effusion.  Age
 indeterminate lower thoracic vertebral body compression deformity for which
 clinical correlation is suggested.
