                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is 3.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube ends below the diaphragm but
 distal end is not included in this study.  Even with the presence of the NG
 tube, the stomach is still distended.  Significant worsening of widespread
 lung opacities is probably explained by a mix of neurogenic edema and volume
 overload in this patient with intracranial bleeding.  The cardiac contour is
 top normal.  Mediastinum is slightly larger than the previous exam due to
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  New left jugular line is in
 adequate position in the upper SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube and left jugular line are in adequate position.
 2.  The distal end of the NG tube is not included in this study, but the
 stomach is still distended.
 3.  Worsening of severe lung opacities which is probably a mix of neurogenic
 edema and volume overload.  
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
