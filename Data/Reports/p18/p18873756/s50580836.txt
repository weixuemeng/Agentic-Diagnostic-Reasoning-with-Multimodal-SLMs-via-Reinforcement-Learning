                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath status post fall question pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and overlying atelectasis. 
 There is fluid in the minor fissure versus thickening of the fissure, likely
 fluid.  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable given low lung volumes.
