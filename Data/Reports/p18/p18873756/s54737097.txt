 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, question aspiration during
 intubation, ET tube position ?
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube resides approximately 3.2 cm above the carina.  The
 orogastric tube is seen extending into the left upper abdomen.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is not well-defined, which could indicate elevation of the right
 lung base.  Lung volumes are low.  The left lung appears clear.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits.  The bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal and orogastric tubes positioned appropriately. 
 Subtle opacity right lung base could represent aspiration.
