                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent pleural effusion/scarring.
 Etiology unclear  // Any evidence of recurrence? Worsening pleural disease?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided volume loss and chronic pleural thickening and/or effusion
 accompanied by a multifocal parenchymal scarring and bronchiectasis is similar
 to the prior radiograph.  Multiple bilateral calcified granulomas also appear
 unchanged as well as a focal area of scarring in the left upper lobe. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable radiographic appearance of the chest. If there is high clinical
 suspicion for progression of abnormalities, CT would be more sensitive than
 radiographs and may be considered for more complete assessment if warranted
 clinically.
