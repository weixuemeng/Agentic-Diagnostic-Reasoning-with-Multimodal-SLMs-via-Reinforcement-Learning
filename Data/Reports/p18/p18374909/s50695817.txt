                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man with effusion, status post chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New right lung base pleural drain has been placed with tip ending
 laterally.  Right lung base opacities have apparently improved, although
 comparison is difficult due to patient positioning.  Bilateral small opacities
 already characterized as calcified granulomas  in CT of ___ are
 unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.  Blunting of the right costovertebral
 space is probably due to pleural effusion.  Small right apical pneumothorax.
 New subcutaneous emphysema is alongside the left chest wall and in the
 cervical region.
