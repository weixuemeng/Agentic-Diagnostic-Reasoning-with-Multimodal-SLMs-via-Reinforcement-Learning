                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:14 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recurrent pleural effusion after thoracoscopy
 and chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 9:47 a.m.:
 
 Atelectasis has recurred in the right lower lung, after insertion of pleural
 drainage tube in the persistent pleural space.  The apices are excluded from
 the examination and it is hard to say whether there is no pneumothorax in the
 right upper chest, since distention of the esophagus may be simulating
 juxtamediastinal pleural air.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size top normal is
 chronic.  No endotracheal or nasogastric tube is seen.
