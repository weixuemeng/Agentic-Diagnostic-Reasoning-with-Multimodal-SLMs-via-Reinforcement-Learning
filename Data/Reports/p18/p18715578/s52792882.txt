 of bibasilar atelectasis, similar.  Increased bibasilar opacities, may
 represent atelectasis secondary to a shallower inspiration.  Consider
 pneumonitis in the appropriate clinical setting.  Follow-up radiograph with
 better inspiratory effort may be helpful.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Very shallow inspiration.
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. Consider pneumonitis in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
