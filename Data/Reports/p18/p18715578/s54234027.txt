  Lungs are low in volume with bibasilar linear opacities, compatible with
  scarring, likely unchanged allowing for lung volumes and AP technique.  No
  acute intrathoracic process.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, acute encephalopathy, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased.  As a consequence, the pre-existing areas of plate-like
 atelectasis at both lung bases have increased in extent.  Otherwise, no
 abnormalities are seen.  No pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
