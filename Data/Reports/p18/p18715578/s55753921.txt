                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is linear left mid to
 lower lung atelectasis/scarring.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No definite
 focal consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely
 accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Areas of left
 mid to lower lung atelectasis/scarring.
