                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Gait instability.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is a triangular-shaped opacity in the right mid lung
 zone, consistent with right middle lobe atelectasis.  Scarring in the right
 mid lung zone and along the left base is unchanged.  The possible nodular
 opacity in the left upper lung zone appears similar to the prior exams and
 represents the costochondral junction.  There is no new opacity, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal other than atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic arch.  An
 eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Surgical clips in the
 right upper quadrant are likely from a prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Unchanged right middle lobe atelectasis and bilateral scarring.
 Again, a non-emergent CT of the chest is recommended for further
 characterization given persistent middle lobe atelectasis.
