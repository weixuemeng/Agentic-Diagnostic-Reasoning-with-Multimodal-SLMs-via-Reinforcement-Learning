 HISTORY:  Status post bronch with left atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is improved aeration of the left upper lobe.  There continues to be
 dense opacity in the retrocardiac region compatible with volume
 loss/infiltrate/effusion.  There is hazy opacity projecting over the right
 lung compatible with right-sided effusion and alveolar edema.  An underlying
 infectious infiltrate can't be excluded.  ET tube, NG tube, and right-sided
 PICC line are unchanged.

 Improved aeration in the left upper lung.
