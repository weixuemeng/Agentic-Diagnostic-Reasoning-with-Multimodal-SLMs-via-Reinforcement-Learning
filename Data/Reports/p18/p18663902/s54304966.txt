 WET READ: ___ ___ 4:57 AM
  1.  Interval development of opacity of the right upper lung field which
  appears to be demarcated by the minor fissure; the lung markings are visible
  through this opacity.  It is unusual in appearance but may represent loculated
  pleural fluid.  Per clinical team, there has been no recent venous
  intervention in the neck or chest. 2.  Interval increase in consolidation over
  the right lung field, which could be secondary to infection or perhaps edema. 
  3.  Interval increase in small right pleural effusion and interval decrease in
  left pleural effusion.  Given the complexity of these findings and the change
  in patient's respiratory status, if clinically possible, CT is recommended for
  further evaluation.  Discussed with ___ by telephone at 04:55 on ___ at the time of wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:30 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.  Recently intubated.  Check ET tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Particularly because this radiograph was taken with the patient supine, it is
 difficult to say whether the new opacification in the right upper hemithorax
 is posteriorly layering pleural effusion or collapse of the right upper lobe. 
 An upright radiograph would be helpful in making the distinction.  Previously
 collapsed left lower lobe and moderate left pleural effusion have both
 improved since ___.  Consolidation in the right lower lobe has
 worsened.  Previous mild cardiomegaly has improved.  There is no pneumothorax.
 ET tube and right PICC line are in standard placements.  Upper enteric
 drainage tube ends in the mid portion of non-distended stomach.  No
 pneumothorax.
