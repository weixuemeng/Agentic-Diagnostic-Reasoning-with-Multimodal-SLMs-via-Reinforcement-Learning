                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
 left sided atelectasis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates the endotracheal tube,
 nasogastric tube, and right PICC unchanged in position.  Cardiomegaly and
 vascular congestion are persistent. New septal thickening is consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the
 left, are likely unchanged, with apparent fluctuations likely due to changes
 in patient position. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent cardiomegaly and vascular congestion, with new mild pulmonary
 edema. 
 
 2. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, allowing for changes in patient
 position.
