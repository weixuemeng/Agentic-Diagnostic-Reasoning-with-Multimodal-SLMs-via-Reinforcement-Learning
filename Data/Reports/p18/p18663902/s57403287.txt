                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Follow up left lower lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  There is dense retrocardiac
 opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  There is increased
 left effusion that is layering posteriorly.  There is hazy bilateral
 vasculature compatible with fluid overload.  There is a small right effusion. 
 There is right lower lobe volume loss.  Patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate
 are also present bilaterally.  The ET tube, right-sided PICC line, and NG tube
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple areas of volume loss and infiltrate superimposed on
 pulmonary edema.
