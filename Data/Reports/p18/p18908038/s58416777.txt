                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  578
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation *** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // post intubation check for tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, out of the field of view.  Streaky right base opacity is
 worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration versus atelectasis given adjacent mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by AP
 technique.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
