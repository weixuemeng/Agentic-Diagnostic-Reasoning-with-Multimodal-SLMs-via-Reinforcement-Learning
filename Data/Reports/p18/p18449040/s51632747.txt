 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky left lower lobe opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Hypertrophic changes are
 seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
