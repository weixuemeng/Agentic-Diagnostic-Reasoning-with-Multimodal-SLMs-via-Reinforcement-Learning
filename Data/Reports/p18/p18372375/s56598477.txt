                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Exertional dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no change in
 cardiac size and no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
 
 There is suggestion of some increased prominence of the right and possibly
 also left hilum.  To determine whether this reflects a true lymphadenopathy or
 central mass, CT would be suggested.
