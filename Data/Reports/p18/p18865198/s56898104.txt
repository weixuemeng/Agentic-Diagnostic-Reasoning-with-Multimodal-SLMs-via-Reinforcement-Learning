                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post laparoscopic right colectomy on
 ___ presenting with larger pleural effusion status post
 pleurocentesis and pigtail placement.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS:  A pigtail catheter terminating in the right
 medial lung base is less kinked than on the prior exam, but otherwise
 unchanged.  There is a partially loculated moderate right pleural effusion
 with a larger intrafissural component.  A small residual pneumothorax is best
 seen on the lateral view.  Evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 limited but overall unchanged.
