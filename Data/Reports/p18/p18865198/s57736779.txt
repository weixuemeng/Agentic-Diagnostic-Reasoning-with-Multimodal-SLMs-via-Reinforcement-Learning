                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILMS, ___ AT 12:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post chest tube removal, question
 pneumothorax, status post VATS decortication.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 10:01.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted, ___ at 12:28.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of two right-sided chest tubes.  There is now seen a
 curvilinear line along the lateral mid hemithorax which suggests the presence
 of a loculated pneumothorax.  No pleural line is visible at the apex.  There
 is minimal amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall soft
 tissues.  In addition, there is a layering right-sided pleural effusion with
 some loculated fluid likely within the minor fissure.  Left lung is well
 inflated and grossly clear.  There is patchy right basilar opacity most likely
 representing compressive atelectasis.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.  Followup imaging would be advised to assess for
 interval change.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Results of this examination
 were conveyed by phone to ___, the patient's nurse, on ___ at 12:39
