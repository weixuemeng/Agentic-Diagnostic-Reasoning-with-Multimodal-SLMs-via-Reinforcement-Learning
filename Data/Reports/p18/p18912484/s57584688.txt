                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post dual-chamber pacemaker placement, here to confirm
 lead placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 13:42.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  frontal radiographs of the chest.  Positioning of the patient is
 not stipulated.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and the NGT removed in the interim
 since the most recent prior study.  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged
 with two leads terminating in the right atrium and apex of the right
 ventricle, unchanged from the preceding study.  A right internal jugular
 Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in position with the tip in the main pulmonary
 artery.  A right apical chest tube is in place.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is patchy opacification of the right lung compared to the left and a
 small right pleural effusion is present.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated
 compared to the left.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. The
 patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple mediastinal surgical
 clips, compatible with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 CoreValve stent projects over the aorta, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of dual-channel pacer leads.
 2.  Interval removal of ET and NG tubes with otherwise stable placement of
 support devices.
 3.  Opacification of the right lung with elevated right hemidiaphragm likely
 reflects a combination of pleural fluid, atelectasis and possible asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.
