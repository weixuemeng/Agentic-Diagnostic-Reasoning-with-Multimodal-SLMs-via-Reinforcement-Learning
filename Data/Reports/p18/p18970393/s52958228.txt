                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and HCC s/p bleed this admission
 from TIPS complication vs new hepatic mass; now more SOB w O2 requirement,
 concern for effusion vs pulm edema  // evidence of significant pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 02:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated supine positioning.
 
 Rotation limits direct comparison to the prior film, peptic could for
 assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Allowing for this, the
 enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably similar to the prior film. 
 The enlarged
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora.  Allowing
 for technical differences, this may be slightly worse than on the prior film. 
 Although there is suggestion of vascular blurring as can be seen with
 interstitial edema, this could be accentuated by under penetrated technique
 and overlying soft tissues.
 
 Again seen is deformity and pleural thickening along the right chest wall of
 indeterminate acuity.
 
 The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  Left the extreme left
 costophrenic is obscured by overlying soft tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam, particularly to assess for interval changes, given considerable
 differences in technique and positioning.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary hila remain enlarged, similar
 to prior.
 
 There is prominent upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora,
 probably slightly more pronounced than on the prior film, given technical
 limitations.  No definite increase in the degree of interstitial edema, given
 overlying soft tissues and underpenetration.
 
 The costophrenic sulci are not well visualized.  Allowing for this, no gross
 effusion.
