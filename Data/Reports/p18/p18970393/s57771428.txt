                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  No previous BID MC radiographs on PACs record for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic and supine positioning.  Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  Possible background
 hyperinflation/COPD.  The mediastinum is prominent and there is also
 cardiomegaly, likely accentuated by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning.
 The aorta appears tortuous.  The hila are likely prominent, with a somewhat
 tapered appearance.  There is upper zone redistribution and vas and slight
 vascular engorgement.  Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to exclude
 be some pleural thickening along the inner surface of the right chest wall. 
 The differential diagnosis could include subpleural soft tissue related to
 body habitus.  Doubt pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and lordotic, supine positioning.
 
 2.  Possible background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 3.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with tortuous aorta.  This is likely
 accentuated by technical factors as well as body habitus.  Clinical
 correlation requested.
 
 4.  Mild vascular engorgement without overt CHF.
 
 5.  Possible pleural thickening along the right chest wall --___ could be
 sequela of remote trauma or relate to body habitus.
 
 6.  Small effusions would be difficult to exclude.
