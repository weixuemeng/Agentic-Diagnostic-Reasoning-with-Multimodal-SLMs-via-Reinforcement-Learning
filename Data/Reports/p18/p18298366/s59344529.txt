                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a right pleural drain
 in place and the expected postoperative appearance of the mediastinum. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A small right lower lung opacity likely
 represents atelectasis, but should continue to be monitored.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right lower lobe opacity which likely represents atelectasis, but should
 continue to be monitored.
 
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
 
 3. Normal postoperative appearance of the mediastinum.
