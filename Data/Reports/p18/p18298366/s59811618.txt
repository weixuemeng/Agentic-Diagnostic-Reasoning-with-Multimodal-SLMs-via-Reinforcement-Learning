 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multilobe PNA and left pleural effusion.
 S/p thoracentesis on ___ and ___.  // Please eval interval PNA and left
 effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged. The heart is normal in size.  There is a small to moderate left
 pleural effusion, which has increased since the prior examination. Opacity at
 the left base most likely represent adjacent atelectasis however superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  Also seen is opacification of the left upper
 lobe, which has improved since the prior study.  A subtle opacity in the right
 mid lung is concerning for an additional focus of pneumonia.  A small right
 pleural effusion is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
