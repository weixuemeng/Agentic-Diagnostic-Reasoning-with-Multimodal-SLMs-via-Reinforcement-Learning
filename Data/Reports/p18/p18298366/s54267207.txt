                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrating right pleural drain
 and the expected postoperative appearance of the mediastinum.  The right lower
 lobe opacity is less distinct than prior radiograph and appears smaller,
 likely representing resolving atelectasis.  There is no new focal opacity. 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right lower lobe opacity most likely represents atelectasis. 
 
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged.
