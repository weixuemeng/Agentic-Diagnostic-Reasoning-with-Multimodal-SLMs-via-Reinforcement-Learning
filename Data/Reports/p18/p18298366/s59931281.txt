                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post minimally invasive esophagectomy.  Evaluate for interval
 change.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post minimally invasive esophagectomy, and a
 neoesophagus is redemonstrated to the right of the mediastinum.  Within the
 neoesophagus, an air-fluid level is again identified.  The lungs are clear,
 without evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 frank pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No acute
 bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Status post esophagectomy with an air-fluid level identified within the
 neoesophagus.  Note that physiologic function cannot be assessed without
 dynamic imaging.
