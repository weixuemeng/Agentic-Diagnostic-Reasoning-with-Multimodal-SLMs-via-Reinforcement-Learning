                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates no focal consolidation. Linear
 opacity within the left lingula is likely reflective of atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen. There is no large pleural effusion. Osseous structures are
 without acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality. Linear opacification within the left
 lingula thought reflective of atelectasis.
