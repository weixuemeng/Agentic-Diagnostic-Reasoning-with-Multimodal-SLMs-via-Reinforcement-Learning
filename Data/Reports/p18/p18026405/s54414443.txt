 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There relatively low lung volumes.  Streaky linear mid to lower lung opacities
 bilaterally most likely are due to atelectasis.  There is also probably a mild
 component of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable and unremarkable.  Lucency
 under the right hemidiaphragm is felt to be within bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Top-normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary
 congestion.  Bilateral areas of mid to lower lung atelectasis.
