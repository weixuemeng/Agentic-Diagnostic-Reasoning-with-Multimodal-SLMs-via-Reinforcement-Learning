                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post ___'s with pulmonary edema. 
 Please evaluate interval change in pulmonary edema, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.   
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, bilateral
 alveolar and interstitial opacities appear worsened, however this represents a
 limited evaluation given change in obliquity and patient's positioning. There
 is a moderate right pleural effusion. Underlying pneumonia in the right lung
 however, cannot be excluded. Left hemidiaphragm is not completely visualized,
 this could be related to increased pleural fluid or due to oblique
 positioning. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Apparent worsening of bilateral alveolar and interstitial
 opacities which may be related to change in obliquity and change in patient's
 positioning. Straight AP chest radiograph would be helpful for a complete
 evaluation.
