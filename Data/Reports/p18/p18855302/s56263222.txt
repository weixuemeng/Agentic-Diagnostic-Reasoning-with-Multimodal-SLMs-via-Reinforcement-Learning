                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with advanced cervical cancer, now with Tmax
 ___, tachy to 140s  // r/o consolidation     r/o consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there
 is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  On this single
 frontal view, no definite focal pneumonia is appreciated, though there is some
 asymmetric opacification at the right base that could merely represent
 prominent vessels.  If clinically possible, a PA and lateral view would be
 most helpful to demonstrate or exclude superimposed pneumonia.
