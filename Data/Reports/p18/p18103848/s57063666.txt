                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o severe AS and acute on chronic HFrEF ___
 ischemia and valvular disease with acute oxygen desaturation and shortness of
 breath.  // Pulmonary edema vs infiltrate     Pulmonary edema vs infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with engorgement of poorly defined pulmonary vessels
 consistent with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
 In view of the extensive parenchymal changes and in the absence of a lateral
 view, it would be very difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
