 Pulmonary edema vs. infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is substantial
 decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, suggesting that and much
 of the previous appearance relates to clearing pulmonary edema.  However, more
 coalescent area in the left perihilar region is with still worrisome for
 superimposed pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen on the
 lateral view.
