                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post CABG 2 weeks ago with shortness of
 breath and malaise.  // Any evidence of pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion
 of other cardiopulmonary pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, and CABG. 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is persistent moderate
 pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change in appearance of moderate pulmonary edema with
 small bilateral pleural effusions and probable compressive bibasilar
 atelectasis.
