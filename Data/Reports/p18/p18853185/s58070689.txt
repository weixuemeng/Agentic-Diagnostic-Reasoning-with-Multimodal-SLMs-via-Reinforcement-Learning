                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p torsades to VT, cardiac arrest, intubated,
 going for cath today.  // evaluate lines (had A-line placed in axilla), pulm
 infiltrates, edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___, cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion and slight worsening of pulmonary edema.  Left retrocardiac opacity
 has substantially improved, and bilateral pleural effusions have apparently
 decreased in size, although positional differences between the radiographs
 limit comparison.  Malalignment of sternal wires and sternal wire disruption
 are suggestive of chronic sternal dehiscence.
