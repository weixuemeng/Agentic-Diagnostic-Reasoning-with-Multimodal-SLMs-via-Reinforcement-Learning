                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This limits assessment of the lung bases where there
 are patchy ill-defined opacities noted, possibly reflecting atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present, but no overt pulmonary edema is identified.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung volumes. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  Consider repeat views when the patient is able to take an improved
 inspiratory effort for further assessment.
