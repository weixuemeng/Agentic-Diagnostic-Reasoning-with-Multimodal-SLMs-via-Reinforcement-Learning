                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of prostate cancer, who now presents
 hypotensive and septic.  Assess for line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  A left
 internal jugular central venous catheter tip is seen projecting over
 confluence of brachiocephalic veins.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are
 noted, progressed since prior.  Right hemidiaphragm appears elevated,
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart is slightly enlarged.  There is
 perihilar vascular congestion.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over confluence
 of brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, likely pulmonary
 edema, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
