                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with epigastric pain, shoulder pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___ at 10:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 present, although the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy and
 streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. 
 Trace left pleural effusion seen on recent CT is not well assessed on this
 current exam.  There is no pneumothorax.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion seen
 on preceding CT is not well assessed on the current exam.  No subdiaphragmatic
 free air.
