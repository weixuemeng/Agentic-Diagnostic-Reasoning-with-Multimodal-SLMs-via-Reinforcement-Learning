 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 5 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  assess dobhoff placement  // assess if dobhoff post pyloric     
 assess if dobhoff post pyloric
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 13:52.
 
 Severe pulmonary edema has worsened, accompanied by moderate pleural
 effusions.  Heart size normal.  Mediastinal veins are distended.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place has been advanced at least as far
 as the distal stomach and perhaps into the first portion of the duodenum. 
 Unfortunately unless the tube is advanced further to assume a characteristic
 orientation in the duodenum or distal stomach, it will not be possible to
 localize the tip position more precisely.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Left central venous line ends in the low SVC.
