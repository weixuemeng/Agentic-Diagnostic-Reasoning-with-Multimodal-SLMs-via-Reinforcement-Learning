                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ex-lap check OG position  // OG position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, an orogastric tube is been placed,
 terminating in the body of the stomach.  Large left pleural effusion has
 substantially increased in size since CT of ___, and is
 associated with adjacent atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe.  The
 effusion could be due to hemothorax in the setting of recent splenic rupture. 
 Persistent right basilar atelectasis and possible small right pleural
 effusion.  Diffuse haziness throughout the upper abdomen is consistent with
 known ascites on CT of 1 day earlier.
