                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVR Tv ring  // eval pneumos      eval
 pneumos
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13 37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:38 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Overall cardiac mediastinal
 contours are stable. There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with
 associated patchy airspace disease likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  No pulmonary
 edema. Small bilateral apical pneumothoraces which are less apparent on the
 current study when compared to prior suggesting possible interval decrease in
 size versus differences in positioning.
