                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal, but slightly increased in size compared to the
 prior exam.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Streaky linear
 opacities in both lung bases with evidence ___ ___ B-lines may reflect mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, though an infectious process cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar linear and streaky airspace opacities likely reflect mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, though an atypical infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  Recommend followup radiographs after diuresis.
