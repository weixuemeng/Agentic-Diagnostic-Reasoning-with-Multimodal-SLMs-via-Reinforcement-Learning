                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain/ back pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Lung volumes are low
 which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette. The heart size does
 appear at least mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is demonstrated with probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. Minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic sulcus suggests a trace right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present. Streaky opacities are seen within the lung bases,
 likely atelectasis.  Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.  Remote bilateral rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace
 right pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.
