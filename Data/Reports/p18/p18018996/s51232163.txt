                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with newly placed NG tube, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the
 expected location of the second portion of the duodenum.  Clip in the right
 upper quadrant likely reflects prior cholecystectomy.  There is some crowding
 of the vasculature which likely reflects patchy atelectasis due to a poor
 inspiratory effort as on the second acquired image, this area seems to be
 demonstrating improved aeration.  No focal airspace consolidation, pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size given
 portable technique.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
