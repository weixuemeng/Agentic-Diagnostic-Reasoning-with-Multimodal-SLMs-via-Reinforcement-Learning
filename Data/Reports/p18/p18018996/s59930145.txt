                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___ and ___.  There is increased
 retrocardiac opacity, which is somewhat linear in configuration.  Given low
 lung volumes, this could be due to atelectasis; however, component of
 infection cannot be excluded.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear of consolidation
 or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable atelectasis, noting that a component of infection cannot
 be excluded in the proper clinical setting.  Please correlate clinically.
