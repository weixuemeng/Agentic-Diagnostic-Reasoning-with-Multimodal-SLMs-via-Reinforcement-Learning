                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with diastolic congestive
 heart failure and shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is substantial interval progression of perihilar
 opacities and basal consolidations.  Although they might reflect interval
 development of pulmonary edema, infectious process is a possibility giving
 more posteriorly located abnormalities with relative sparing of the immediate
 perihilar areas and anterior aspects of the lungs.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion is seen which also contributes to the possibility of infectious
 process.  No pneumothorax is seen.
