                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded, with mild unchanged interstitial
 abnormality.  Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate in size, and increased
 from ___.  There is a waving and waning patchy opacity in the right mid
 lung, probably in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, suspected to
 represent atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are notable for calcification of the aortic knob and
 tortuosity of the aorta.  There is marked degenerative change of the bilateral
 glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial abnormality and increase in bilateral pleural
 effusions may reflect worsening cardiac decompensation.  Patchy right upper
 lobe opacity, suspected to reflect atelectasis.
