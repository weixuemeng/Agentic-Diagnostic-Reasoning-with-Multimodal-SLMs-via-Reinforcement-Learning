 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe AS, CHF, pleural effusion,
 questioned pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study ___.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 15:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right chest tube remains in place.  There continue to be layering bilateral
 effusions, left greater than right, with patchy bibasilar airspace process
 which may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.  Heart remains enlarged.  There is
 calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  No large
 pneumothorax is seen.  No pulmonary edema.  There is deformity of the left
 humeral head and glenoid with sclerosis and remodeling and joint space
 narrowing.  There is resorption of the distal clavicle.  All of these changes
 likely are secondary to remote trauma.
