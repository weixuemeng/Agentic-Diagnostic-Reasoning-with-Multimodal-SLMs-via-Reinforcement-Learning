                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with probable decrease in size of
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, although positional differences
 limit comparison between the exams.  Horizontal interface in lower right
 hemithorax on the frontal view appears to correspond to a loculated anterior
 hydropneumothorax on the lateral radiograph, and note is made of previous
 loculated hydropneumothorax in this region on CT of ___.
 
 On the left, there is apparent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 increased distance between the apparent diaphragm level and adjacent bowel in
 the abdomen, suggesting a moderate subpulmonic pleural effusion on the left. 
 Bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly improved, and heterogeneous
 opacities in the right mid and right lower lung are also slightly better.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apparent slight decrease in size of right pleural effusion with loculated
 anterior hydropneumothorax.
 2.  Moderate subpulmonic left pleural effusion.
 3.  Improving bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis and heterogeneous right lung
 opacities.
