 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis,
 not significantly changed from prior examination. However, there appears to be
 more prominent opacification of the right lung base.  Small left pleural
 effusion is not significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is
 within the upper limits of normal.  Calcification of the aortic arch is
 unchanged from prior.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusion are not significantly
 changed compared to the prior radiograph.
 2. Right lung base opacity appears more prominent. Differential includes
 atelectasis vs. pulmonary vascular congestion. Pneumonia could be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
