                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly persists.  Aorta demonstrates diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is
 mild pulmonary edema which is new compared to the prior exam.  Worsening
 opacification is seen within the right lung base with interval increase in
 size of a right pleural effusion which is now moderate in extent.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis, and a small left pleural effusion
 is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Chronic deformities are
 again seen involving both shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings concerning for right basilar pneumonia with increased size of right
 pleural effusion, now moderate in extent.  Mild pulmonary edema is also
 present.
