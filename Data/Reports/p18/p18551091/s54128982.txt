                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, decreased right breath sounds, evaluate for
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Cardiomediastinal contour is otherwise unchanged
 and calcifications in the aortic arch are noted.  Small to moderate right
 pleural effusion  has slightly increased. Small left pleural effusion is
 stable. Fluid is again seen within the minor fissure. Increased opacification
 at the right base could relate to increased effusion and mild pulmonary edema;
 but consolidation is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax.  Extensive
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints and clavicles are again seen.
