                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic bilateral pleural
 effusions, status post thoracocentesis yesterday with 3 liters drained. 
 Assess changes in spiculated lesion near right cardiac silhouette.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  The previously documented
 successful right-sided thoracocentesis persists and there is no evidence of
 significant reaccumulation of the right-sided pleural effusion.  There exist
 some increased linear vascular pattern on the right lung base, most likely
 representing interstitial edema.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. 
 Findings in the left hemithorax are rather unchanged with obliteration of the
 left-sided diaphragmatic contour with blunting of the left lateral pleural
 sinus.  The lateral view demonstrates the presence of a left-sided pleural
 effusion obliterating the entire posterior pleural sinus up to the level of
 the hila.  An estimate suggests volume of about 1 liter.  There is no evidence
 of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and no pneumothorax is noted on
 either side.  Cardiac enlargement is obvious.  The appearance of the generally
 widened aorta with advanced wall calcifications appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No reoccurrence of pleural effusion following right-sided
 thoracocentesis.  Significant amount of pleural effusion exists also on the
 left side.Consider left sided thoracentese as well.
