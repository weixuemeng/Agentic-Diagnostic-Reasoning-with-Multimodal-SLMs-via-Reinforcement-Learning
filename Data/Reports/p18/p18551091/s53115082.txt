                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with congestive heart failure and COPD, now with
 worsening shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Large right and small left pleural effusions are stable to slightly increased.
 Underlying consolidations most likely represent atelectasis, although
 underlying infection is difficult to exclude.  The aerated upper lungs
 demonstrate no focal consolidation or pneumothorax; lower right lung and heart
 are largely obscured by the large effusion and atelectasis.  Aortic
 calcification is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable to slightly increased large right pleural effusion.
