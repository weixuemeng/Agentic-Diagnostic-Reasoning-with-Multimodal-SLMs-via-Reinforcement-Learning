                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a cough, CHF and PleurX catheter for
 recurrent pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large right pleural effusion has developed, with no appreciable leftward
 mediastinal shift suggesting chronic accumulation and equivalent atelectasis. 
 Configuration of the proximal humerus, left; and clavicle suggests rheumatoid
 arthritis, which may be the cause of the pleural effusion.  Catheter
 projecting over the right lung base has failed to drain the pleural effusion.
