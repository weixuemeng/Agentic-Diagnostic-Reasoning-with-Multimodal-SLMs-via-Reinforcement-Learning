 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion
 has increased in extent.  The pre-existing right basal opacity is consolidated
 and no longer seen.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely
 caused by a small left pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
