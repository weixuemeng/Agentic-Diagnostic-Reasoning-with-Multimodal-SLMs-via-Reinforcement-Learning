                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, as before.  Unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta and calcification appear unchanged.  More generally, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Mild interstitial prominence
 suggests slight congestion or fluid overload.  There is increasing left
 basilar opacification suspected to reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 developing pleural effusion.  In addition to streaky lower lobe opacities, the
 lateral view suggests more confluent opacification in the right middle lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, increased, with
 developing pleural effusion on the right.  Another change is increasing right
 basilar opacity that may indicate an infectious process developing in the
 lower lungs, with particular suspicion for the right middle lobe.
