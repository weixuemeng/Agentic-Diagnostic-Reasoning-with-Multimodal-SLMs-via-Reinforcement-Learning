                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, increased lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is increased in size compared to the previous
 exam.  Mitral valvular calcifications are again demonstrated.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Moderate pulmonary edema is new compared to
 the previous chest radiograph, with interval increase in size of small
 bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  More focal opacities
 within the lung bases may reflect compressive atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Extensive degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are
 re- demonstrated with erosion of the undersurface of the acromion and distal
 clavicle on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left, and bibasilar atelectasis.
