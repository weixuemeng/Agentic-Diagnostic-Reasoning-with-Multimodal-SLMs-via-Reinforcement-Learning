                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and history of
 congestive heart failure.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffusely increased bilateral interstitial markings, with
 associated bibasilar focal consolidations, right worse than left,  that
 obscure the margins of both hemidiaphragms and the right heart border. There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed due
 to obscuration of sillouhette by basilar consolidations. Severe
 atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Findings compatible with interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of
 known cardiomegaly. 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may be the result of a
 combination of bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions,
 underlying consolidation, particularly in the right lower lobe is of concern. 
 3.  Right middle lobe atelectasis is also present.
