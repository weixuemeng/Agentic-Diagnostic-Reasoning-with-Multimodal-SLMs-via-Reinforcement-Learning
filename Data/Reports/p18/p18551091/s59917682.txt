                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx pneumonia, CHF, pleural efffusion, with
 ongoing productive cough  // r/o pneumonia, CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural
 effusion has slightly decreased in extent. A rounded opacity adjacent to the
 effusion could corresponds to a rounded atelectasis. However, confirmation of
 this assumption must be performed with CT.  The shape and morphology of the
 lesion would be atypical for pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly with no signs of
 pulmonary edema. Mild elongation of the descending aorta.  Unchanged calcific
 paraaortic structure projecting behind the heart.
 Unchanged left humeral lesion.
