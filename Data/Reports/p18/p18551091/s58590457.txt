                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent pneumonia
 after congestive heart failure exacerbation.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and
 multiple prior examinations.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Since the prior examination, it has been
 substantial interval improvement in bilateral basal consolidations and pleural
 effusions.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is small to
 moderate amount of right pleural effusion noted associated with atelectasis. 
 Lateral view demonstrates large nodular opacity projecting above the left
 hemidiaphragm on the lateral view, its location is unclear. It can be seen
 retrospectively back on ___ radiograph although potentially has
 slightly increased since then.  If clinically warranted, assessment of this
 abnormality with chest CT might be considered.  There is no pneumothorax.
