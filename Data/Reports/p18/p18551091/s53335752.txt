                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is less
 prominent, though some of this could merely reflect the PA rather than AP
 portable position.  Pulmonary vascularity has improved.  Continued blunting of
 the costophrenic angle is consistent with small pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
