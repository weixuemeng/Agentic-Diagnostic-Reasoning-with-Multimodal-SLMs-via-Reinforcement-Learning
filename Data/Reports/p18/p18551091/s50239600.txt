                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known fluid overload and pleur-x catheter presenting with severe
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A Pleur-x catheter is seen terminating in the upper portion of the right lung.
 Compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is a persistent
 moderate right-sided pleural effusion, slightly improved in the interval, with
 a new small air-fluid level in the right lung base suggesting a small
 hydropneumothorax component. Increased right basilar opacity may reflect
 atelectasis, although infection is not excluded.  Patchy left basilar opacity
 is also slightly worse in the interval.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Deformity
 of the left humeral head is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion with increased right basilar opacity,
 likely atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.  
 
 2. A new small air-fluid level in the right lung base suggests a small
 hydropneumothorax component. 
 
 3. Worsening left basilar opacity could indicate atelectasis, but infection is
 also not excluded in this region.
 
 4. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
