 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion, underwent right
 pleural fluid thoracocentesis, checking for reduction of pleural fluid and

 study of ___.  The degree of cardiomegaly appears unchanged. 
 Pulmonary congestive pattern with some perivascular haze as before. 
 Comparison of the frontal views demonstrates marked reduction of the
 right-sided pleural effusion that obliterated the lateral pleural sinus.  The
 left-sided pleural density blunting the pleural sinus and obliterating the
