                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M with shortness of breath, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous  and
 diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Linear 
 opacities in the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflect areas of 
 atelectasis or scarring.  Partially loculated right pleural effusion is small
 and unchanged from prior. Right basilar patchy opacity may reflect
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Marked abnormality  of both
 glenohumeral joints with bony remodeling of the femoral heads is
 re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior exam.  Continued small partially
 loculated right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion. Right
 basilar patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis but aspiration or infection is
 not completely excluded.
