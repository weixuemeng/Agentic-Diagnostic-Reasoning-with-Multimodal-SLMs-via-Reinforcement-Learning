                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion, increased leg swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar
 enlargement and haziness as well as vascular indistinctness is re-
 demonstrated, slightly improved compared to the prior study.  There are
 persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the
 left, not substantially changed in size.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may
 reflect atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There
 is no pneumothorax identified.  Extensive degenerative changes of both
 shoulders are again demonstrated with high-riding humeral heads.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, slightly improved compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities could reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration are not
 excluded.
