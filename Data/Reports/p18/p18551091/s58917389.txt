                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for differences in technique.  The lung volumes are low, particularly
 in that setting, streaky opacities in both lower lungs are most suggestive of
 minor vague bibasilar atelectasis.  These opacities are also not present on
 the lateral view which appears to have been obtained with better inspiratory
 effort.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened.  Degenerative changes along the mid
 thoracic spine with small-to-moderate anterior osteophytes appear similar. 
 There is similar mild rightward convex thoracic spinal curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky bibasilar opacities with low lung volumes most suggestive
 of minor atelectasis, although infectious process is difficult to completely
 exclude.
