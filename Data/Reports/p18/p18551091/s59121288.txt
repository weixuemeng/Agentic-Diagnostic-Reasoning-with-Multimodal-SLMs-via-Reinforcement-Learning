                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with increasing dyspnea, evaluate for
 CHF or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable AP chest examination of ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 obscured the lung bases, more on the right than the left.  Heart contours are
 obscured, but previously described cardiac enlargement persists as there is
 continuous perivascular haze in the accessible pulmonary vasculature.  There
 are bilateral linear densities in the lung structures indicative of bilateral
 plate atelectasis coinciding with the pleural effusions.  It is impossible to
 identify new pulmonary inflammatory processes, but large new parenchymal
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 The pleural effusions are prominently located in posterior pleural spaces as
 identified on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent evidence of cardiac failure with bilateral pleural
 effusions.  This episode of cardiac failure has now been documented on six
 sequential chest examinations.  The degree of acute pulmonary vascular
 congestion is slightly less marked in comparison to the examination ___ ___.
