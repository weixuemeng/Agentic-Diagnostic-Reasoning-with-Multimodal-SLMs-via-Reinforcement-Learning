                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with worsening dyspnea in the setting of congestive
 heart failure.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval redistribution of the moderate-sized right pleural
 effusion, which now layers dependently rather than in the fissure. Small left
 pleural effusion has increased.  Bibasilar consolidations most likely
 represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Heart size is
 enlarged.  Aortic calcification is seen.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise
 within normal limits.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Mild interstitial edema
 may be slightly improved.  Degenerative change of the left glenohumeral joint
 is partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Redistributed moderate right pleural effusion and increased small left pleural
 effusion.  Minimally improved interstitial edema.  Bibasilar consolidations
 most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
