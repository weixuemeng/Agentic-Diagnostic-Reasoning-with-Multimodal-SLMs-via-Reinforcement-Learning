                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea for two days.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably with a
 lateral performed 1 hour later.  New bibasilar opacities with indistinctness
 of the pulmonary vasculature is likely due to pulmonary edema with increased
 pleural effusions.  Underlying infection cannot be excluded.  The heart cannot
 be assessed.  The aortic knob appearance is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Degenerative changes are seen in the shoulder girdles
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggest congestive heart failure. Underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment.
 
 Please refer to clip ___for the lateral view.
