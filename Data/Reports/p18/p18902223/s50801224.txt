                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight loss.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs volumes are normal. 
 Prominence of the right paratracheal stripe is undoubtedly related to tortuous
 vascularity.  There is no lung mass.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Heart
 size is normal and the aorta tortuous.
