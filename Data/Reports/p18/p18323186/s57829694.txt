                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsened dyspnea  // pulm edema, effusion
 infiltrate, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged which may be exaggerated
 secondary to low lung volumes.  No focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or
 pulmonary edema are seen.  There is significant gastric distention with little
 evidence of gas in adjacent small bowel loops, raising the question of the
 gastric outlet obstruction versus gastroparesis.  Recommend follow-up
 abdominal plain film radiography for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant gastric distention with left with gas in the adjacent small bowel
 loops raising question of gastric outlet obstruction versus gastroparesis and
 no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up abdominal plain film radiography
 further evaluation.
