                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and elevated white count.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There are mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.  Deformity of the distal right clavicle is compatible with
 remote trauma.  Partially imaged are screws within the left humeral head. 
 There is mild deformity of the right 5th rib laterally, and a fracture cannot
 be excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Mild deformity of the right 5th rib
 laterally could reflect a fracture.  Clinical correlation is recommended, and
 a dedicated rib series can be obtained for further evaluation.
