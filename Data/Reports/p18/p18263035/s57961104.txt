                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cough and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a central catheter
 terminating in the upper right atrium.  There is a large right pleural
 effusion with associated lower lobe consolidation favoring compressive
 atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is also
 a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.  Right lower
 consolidation favors lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.
