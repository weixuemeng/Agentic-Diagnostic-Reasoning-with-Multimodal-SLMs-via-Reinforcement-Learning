 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Substantial left lower lobe atelectasis is present
 accompanied by an adjacent moderate left pleural effusion.  Small right
 pleural effusion is also evident with adjacent atelectasis at the right base. 
 Healed right rib fractures are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with adjacent basilar
 atelectasis, most substantial in the left lower lobe.  Co-existing pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
