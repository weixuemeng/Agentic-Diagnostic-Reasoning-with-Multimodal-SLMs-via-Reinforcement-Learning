                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hematocrit drop, to assess for pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change. 
 Retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 persists, consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Hemodialysis catheter tip again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
