                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST, ___ AT 12:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new PICC line, check placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study of ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest from ___ at 12:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a right PICC line with its tip in the mid-to-distal
 SVC in satisfactory position.  Lungs remain hyperinflated suggesting
 underlying emphysema.  There continues to be a left apical calcified mass with
 some associated left apical pleural thickening.  The left apical pleural
 thickening appears somewhat more prominent than in ___, which although this
 may be related to projectional differences, clinical correlation would be
 advised as these findings are consistent with prior granulomatous infection. 
 A surgical clip is again seen in the soft tissues of the right axilla.  The
 lungs appear grossly clear.  No pleural effusions.  Stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  No pneumothorax.
