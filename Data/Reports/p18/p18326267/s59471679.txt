                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate right PIC catheter tip
 projecting over mid to distal SVC, unchanged.  Lungs are hyperexpanded with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms, suggestive of underlying chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  Again noted a calcified lesion in the left upper lung with
 associated apical scarring, unchanged. Calcified mediastinal nodes are
 re-demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.  A surgical clip in the right axilla is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right PIC catheter tip projects over mid to distal SVC.
 
 2.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
