                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after total left knee
 arthroplasty with possible infection, assessment of the new PICC line
 position.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The right PICC line tip is not clearly seen, most likely terminates at the
 level of mid SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Lungs are
 essentially unchanged in appearance besides bibasal minimal areas of
 atelectasis.  There is questionable nodular opacity seen on the prior study
 from ___ projecting over the anterior end of the second rib, not
 clearly seen on the current study but also seen on study from ___.  Assessment of the patient with chest CT might be considered.  There are
 also calcified hilar lymph nodes as well as calcified left apical granuloma
 consistent with prior granulomatous exposure.
