                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and syncope.  Question
 cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Compared to prior, there are significantly lower lung
 volumes seen.  Bibasilar opacities, particularly on the lateral may be
 therefore secondary to atelectasis; however, clinical correlation is
 recommended to exclude infection.  Cardiac silhouette also appears more
 prominent in size, however, also potentially in part due to low lung volumes. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes on the current exam.  Bibasilar opacities,
 potentially due to atelectasis  however, clinical correlation suggested
 regarding possibility of infection. Apparent increased size of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette potentially also due to poor inspiratory effort.
