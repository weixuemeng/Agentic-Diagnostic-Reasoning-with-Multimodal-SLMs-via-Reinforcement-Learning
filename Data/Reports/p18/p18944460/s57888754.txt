                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant
 accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Within this limitation, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  There is no free
 air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
