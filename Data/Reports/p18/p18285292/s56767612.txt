                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stroke, dysphagia  // assess for aspiration
 or other pathology      assess for aspiration or other pathology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal
 or mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Suggestion of a more coalescent area of
 opacification at the right base could be consistent with the clinical history
 of aspiration.
