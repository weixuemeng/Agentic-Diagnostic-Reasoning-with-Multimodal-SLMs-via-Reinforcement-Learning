                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent
 with volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Some hazy opacification on the right
 could reflect a small pleural effusion.
