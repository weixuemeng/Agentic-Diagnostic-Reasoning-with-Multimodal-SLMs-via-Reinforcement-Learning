                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory ulcerative colitis.  Resolving pneumothorax. 
 Re-evaluate.
 
 Small amount of free air is seen in the left costophrenic angle.  There is
 otherwise no evidence of the pneumothorax that was previously present.
 
 The lung fields are otherwise clear.  The right PICC line has been withdrawn
 and now lies at the atriocaval junction.
