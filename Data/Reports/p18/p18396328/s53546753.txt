                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Probable not definite left pneumothorax, re-evaluate.
 
 The linear density overlying the left upper chest is again noted and care was
 taken to ensure that no skin folds or anything else which could give an
 artifactual line was present.  Small to moderate sized pneumothorax is
 therefore present on the left side.  Elsewhere the support lines and tubes are
 unchanged.  The lung field is otherwise clear.  There is no mediastinal shift.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pneumothorax.
