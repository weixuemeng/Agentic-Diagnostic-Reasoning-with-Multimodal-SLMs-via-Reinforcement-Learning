                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV and cough with recent fevers, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Most evident on the lateral view is a hazy
 opacity seen in the retrocardiac space, which was not as evident on prior
 film.  While this may represent atelectasis, pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting should not be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The mediastinal and cardiac silhouette are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hazy opacity, best appreciated on the lateral view, may represent
 atelectasis, although pneumonia should not be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
