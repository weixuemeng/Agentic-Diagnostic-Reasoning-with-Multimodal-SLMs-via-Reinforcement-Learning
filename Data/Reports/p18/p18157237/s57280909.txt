                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bilateral lower extremity edema for two days. 
 Uncontrolled hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains top normal to mildly enlarge.  There is prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery which may be due to pulmonary arterial hypertension.  On
 the lateral view, posterior basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis;
 however, consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not entirely excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Aortic knob calcification is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema.
