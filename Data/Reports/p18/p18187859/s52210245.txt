                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recurrent giant cell tumor, assessment for pulmonary
 metastasis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The left chest wall deformity is stable.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.  Within the limitations of the study technique, there is no
 evidence of pulmonary nodules worrisome for metastatic disease.  If clinically
 warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered.
