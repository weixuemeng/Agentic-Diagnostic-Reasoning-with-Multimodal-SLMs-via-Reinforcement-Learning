                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increasing O2 requirements.
 
 CHEST:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Film is underexposed.  Heart remains enlarged, consistent with known
 pericardial effusion.  The right effusion is probably somewhat larger than it
 was on the prior film of ___, the left remains unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature appears more prominent, but much of this may be due to
 the underpenetration of the film; however, in view of the patient's symptoms,
 some of it may be due to worsening failure.  There is little increase in the
 size of the heart, but an increase in the pericardial effusion could be
 present.
