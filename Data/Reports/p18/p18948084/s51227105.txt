                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pericardial effusion and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, ___ and MR from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is persistent blunting of the
 right lateral costophrenic angle and trace blunting seen posteriorly.  This
 may be due to small pleural effusion with possible underlying pleural
 thickening or scar laterally.  Faint right basilar opacities have not
 significantly changed since prior and may be due to scar.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged likely in part
 due to pericardial effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Persistent probable small right pleural
 effusion and possible pleural-based scarring.  Unchanged enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette likely in part due to the patient's known pericardial
 effusion.
