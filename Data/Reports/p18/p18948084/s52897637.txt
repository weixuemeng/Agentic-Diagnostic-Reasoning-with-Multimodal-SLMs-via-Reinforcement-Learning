                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 As compared to prior radiograph, there is substantial interval increase in
 pleural effusion, large on the current examination.  There is adjacent
 atelectasis, but the right upper lung is clear.  In the left lower lobe, there
 is vague opacity adjacent to the left ventricle overlying the anterior margin
 of the right sixth rib, and might reflect either bone finding of pulmonary
 abnormality.  Correlation with oblique views is recommended.
