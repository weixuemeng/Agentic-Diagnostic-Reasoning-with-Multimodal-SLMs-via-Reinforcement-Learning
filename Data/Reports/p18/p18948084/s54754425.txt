                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of NHL and prior pleural effusion with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___; CT ___;
 Cardiac MRI ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A small right
 pleural effusion has improved from ___ with improvement in the right
 basilar opacity. Mild persistent opacity is likely atelectasis. A left pleural
 effusion is small. The right upper lung and left lung are clear.  Biapical
 pleural thickening is unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits
 with resolution of pulmonary edema.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is stable from ___ but larger than on ___, due to
 pericardial effusion seen on MRI. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are stable. The spleen is enlarged. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Decreased right pleural effusion, now small. Mild residual adjacent opacity
 is likely atelectasis, but recommend follow up radiograph to document
 resolution. 
 2. No pulmonary edema.
 3. Pericardial effusion.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 11:20am on ___.
