                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place and may potentially be
 intrafissural based upon its course.  A new pleural catheter has been placed
 inferiorly in the right hemithorax, and is associated with decrease in size of
 a loculated right pleural effusion.  Small apicolateral hydropneumothorax
 component has also improved.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but decreased in
 size from the prior examination.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present, slightly
 better on the right in the interval, and a small left pleural effusion has
 decreased in size since the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Decreased size of loculated right pleural effusion following placement of new
 pleural catheter.
