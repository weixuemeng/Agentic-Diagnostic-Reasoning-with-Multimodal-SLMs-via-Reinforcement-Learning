                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but has decreased in size, and is
 accompanied by decreased caliber of the pulmonary vessels which appear more
 distinct than on the prior exam.  Bilateral perihilar haziness has also
 improved in the interval.  Mild residual peribronchial cuffing is seen on the
 right.  Moderate right pleural effusion has probably decreased in size in the
 interval and appears to have a subpulmonic component.  However, differences in
 positioning between the studies limit comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in congestive heart failure. Decrease in size
 of right pleural effusion with residual moderate right effusion with likely
 subpulmonic component.
