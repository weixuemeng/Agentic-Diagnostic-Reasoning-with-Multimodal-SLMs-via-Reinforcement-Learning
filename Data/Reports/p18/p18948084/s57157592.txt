                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased leg swelling and pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is mild upper zone
 vascular redistribution suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Right basilar patchy opacities and adjacent basolateral pleural thickening are
 similar, with no new areas of focal consolidation demonstrated.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and unchanged marked enlargement of cardiac
 silhouette compatible with known pericardial effusion.  No new focal
 consolidation identified. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
