                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with increasing shortness of breath,
 assess for infection, cardiomegaly, or other abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination ___ ___.  The heart size has mildly
 increased in comparison with the previous examination.  Again no typical
 configurational abnormality can be identified.  The aorta is mildly widened
 and elongated but does not demonstrate any local contour abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vasculature has developed an upper zone redistribution pattern, but
 there is no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema nor are there any
 pleural effusions in the pleural sinuses.  No evidence of acute pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates seen.  No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are unchanged and show normal
 appearance with the exception of mild degenerative changes in the mid portion
 of the thoracic spine, but no evidence of vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase of heart size, coinciding with development of upper
 zone redistribution pattern in the pulmonary circulation.  No evidence of any
 new acute pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion.  Radiographic findings
 suggest that the patient's shortness of breath and is probably related to mild
 degree of heart failure.  There is no evidence of any new acute pulmonary
 pneumonic infiltrate.
