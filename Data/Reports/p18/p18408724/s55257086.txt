 EXAM:  Chest, AP frontal portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shingles with cough, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  There is a
 sclerotic focus projecting over the left humeral head, measuring approximately
 1.5 x 1.0 cm.  There is also an ovoid 1.4 cm calcific structure projecting
 over the left axillary soft tissue of unclear etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Sclerotic focus projecting
 over the left humeral head and calcific focus projecting over the left axilla
 of unclear etiology but may represent nonspecific soft tissue calcification. 
 The sclerotic focus projecting over the left humeral head could potentially
 alternatively represent a bone island although was not seen on CT from
