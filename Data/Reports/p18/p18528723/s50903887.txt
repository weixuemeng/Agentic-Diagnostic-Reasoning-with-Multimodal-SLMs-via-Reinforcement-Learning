                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, tachycardia, crackles, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate overinflation, status post CABG, borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette, but no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of pneumonia (a linear dense area on the lateral radiograph results
 from a minimally thickened fissure and over-projection of a rib).
 
 Moderate degenerative spine disease.
