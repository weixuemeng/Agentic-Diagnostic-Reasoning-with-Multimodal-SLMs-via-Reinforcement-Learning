                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG.  Heart remains mildly
 enlarged with left ventricular predominance.  The patient is status post
 aortic valve replacement.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild
 calcification of the aortic knob again demonstrated as well as a mildly
 tortuous course of the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific, possibly
 reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities, which could reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
