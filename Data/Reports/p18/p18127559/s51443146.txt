                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema in a patient with chest pain and
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates mildly low lung
 volumes, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding.  Even allowing for this, heart size is likely mildly enlarged. 
 Diffuse opacity is likely due to moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
