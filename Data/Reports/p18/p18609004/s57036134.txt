                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant with possible pneumonia or edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no definite
 interval change.  There is a vague suggestion of some asymmetry at the bases
 with slight increased opacification on the right.  This could possibly
 represent a developing area of consolidation, though this is not confirmed on
 the lateral view.
 
 The striking changes of renal osteodystrophy are again seen.
