                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to confirm resolution.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is less opacification in
 the right perihilar region.  The relatively dense opacification in the
 retrosternal area on the lateral view is essentially unchanged.  This could
 represent fibrotic healing of a previous inflammatory process.
 
 Remainder of the examination is unchanged.
