                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
 
 There is vague increased opacity in the region of the right hilum latrealy and
 vague opacity in the right midzone laterally, new compared with ___.  This
 likely correspnds to the irregular focal retrosternal opacity seen on the
 lateral view.  
 
 Otherwise, no focal opacity, chf, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours otherwise within limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Focal opacity right perihilar area and right midzone laterally, new compared
 with ___, nonspecific in appearance.  The differential includes, but is
 not limited to, an early pneumonic infiltrate or area of inflammation.  It
 appears to represent a different location from the
 patchy opacity seen on the ___ CT scan.  Recommend follow-up radiographs
 to document resolution.
