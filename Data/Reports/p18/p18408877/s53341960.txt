                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms and
 conspicuity of the reticular architecture, consistent with emphysematous
 disease.  Otherwise, there are no focal opacities.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and there are
 atherosclerotic calcifications at the level of the aortic knob.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Bilateral round opacities in the lower
 lung fields represent the nipples and were seen in prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
