                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis s/p intubation  // ET tube
 placement      ET tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately
 4.6 cm above the carina. An cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and
 there is no definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal
 pneumonia. There is the suggestion of a more coalescent area of opacification
 at the left base, which in the appropriate clinical setting could possibly
 represent a developing area of consolidation.
