                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, recent urinary tract infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear opacities within the right mid lung
 field likely reflect areas of scarring.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of COPD.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Oral contrast is seen within
 bowel loops in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
