  2 cm rounded opacity projecting over the medial aspect of the right lung apex.
  This could reflect superimposition of structures or a true pulmonary nodule.
  Consider further assessment with nonemergent CT. Bronchiectasis in the right
  upper lobe. No evidence of pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified and
 tortuous. Hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Bronchiectasis is noted within the right upper lobe. 2 cm focal
 opacity is noted projecting over the medial aspect of the right apex, and it
 is unclear if this reflects a superimposition of structures or a true
 pulmonary nodule. Remainder of the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are mild
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
