                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The heart is normal in size.  The lungs
 demonstrate patchy opacity in the right upper lobe that has increased since
 the prior radiographs although difficult to compare to the more recent CT.
 This appearance may reflect areas of increased mucous plugging associated with
 suspected lower airway infection or atypical infection.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague increased opacity in the right upper lobe suggesting airway inflammation
 or infection.
