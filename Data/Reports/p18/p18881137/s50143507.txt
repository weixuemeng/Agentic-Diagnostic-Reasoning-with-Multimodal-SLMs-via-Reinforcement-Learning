                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sp shock  // NGT
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:33
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, an NG tube has been placed. The tip and side
 port lie distal to the GE junction, over the expected location of the stomach.
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. There are low inspiratory
 volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip and side-port beneath the diaphragm over the stomach
