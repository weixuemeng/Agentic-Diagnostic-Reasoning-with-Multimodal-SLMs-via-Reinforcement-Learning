                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p ECMO insertion-check
 cannula placement and r/o effusion/infiltrate/PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter with tip terminating in the
 interlobar portion of the right pulmonary artery with no visible pneumothorax.
 ECMO cannula is visible coursing from the inferior vena cava through the right
 atrium to terminate in the expected location of the lower superior vena cava. 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  Widespread
 diffuse pulmonary opacities have slightly improved although differences in
 lung volumes contribute in part to this apparent change.
