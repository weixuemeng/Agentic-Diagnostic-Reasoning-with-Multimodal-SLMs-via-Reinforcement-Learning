                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  No new infiltrate identified.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 29 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. Again
 seen are low inspiratory volumes and increased retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen
 is some increased density in the right cardiophrenic region, unchanged. There
 is mild vascular plethora and faint hazy density, also similar to the prior
 study.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible mild persistent CHF.
 2. Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, which is also similar to the prior
 film. The possibility of associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded, but the appearance is essentially unchanged or slightly improved.
 3. No new infiltrate detected.
