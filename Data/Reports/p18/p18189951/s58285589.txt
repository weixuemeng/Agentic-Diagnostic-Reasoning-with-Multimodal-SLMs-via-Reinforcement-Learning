                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, please evaluate for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours.  The patient is status post CABG
 with midline and intact sternotomy sutures.  Atherosclerotic disease is
 evident in the aortic arch.  Minimal atelectasis present in the bilateral
 lower lungs. Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle likely reflects a small right pleural effusion, possibly
 loculated.  No pneumothorax present.  Multiple radiopaque foci are identified
 in the right lateral subcutaneous tissues possibly representing skin
 calcifcations.  Multilevel degenerative change present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Small right, possibly
 loculated, pleural effusion.
