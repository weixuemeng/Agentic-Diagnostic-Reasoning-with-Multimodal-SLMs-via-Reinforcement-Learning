                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:30 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with V-fib arrest.  Intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is unchanged at the thoracic inlet.  Lung volumes
 remain quite low.  Mild interstitial edema has worsened.  Apparent increase in
 caliber of the aorta at the junction of the arch and descending portions could
 be due in part to difference in radiographic positioning, but there is an
 increase in mediastinal venous distention denoted by dilatation of the azygos
 vein accompanying mild pulmonary edema.  Small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion has increased, and there is more atelectasis at the base of the left
 lung.  Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is also greater,
 all pointing to cardiac decompensation.  Aortic caliber should be monitored
 carefully on subsequent chest radiographs.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC and a nasogastric tube passes to the
 upper stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
