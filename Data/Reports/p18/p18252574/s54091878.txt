                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable view of chest was compared with prior
 radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 With the patient's neck in flexed position, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 ending approximately 7 cm above the carina is high in location.  Consider
 advancing the ET tube by 2-3 cm for a more secured seating.  Orogastric tube
 is coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is
 beyond the radiographic view.  No relevant changes in the lung since ___.  Minimal right lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.  There are no
 new lung opacities of concern.  Normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.
