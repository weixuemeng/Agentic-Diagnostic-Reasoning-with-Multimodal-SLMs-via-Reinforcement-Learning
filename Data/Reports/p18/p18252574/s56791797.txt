                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, now spiking fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube is projected at the mid clavicular level, approximately 6 cm
 above the carina.  This could be advanced by 2 cm.  Nasogastric tube extends
 to at least the upper stomach where it crosses the lower limit of the image.
 
 There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  In view of the
 clinical history, the possibility of superimposed aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or large effusion.
