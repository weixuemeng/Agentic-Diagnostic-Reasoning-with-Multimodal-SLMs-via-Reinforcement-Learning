 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC has been repositioned since the prior radiograph and now
 terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Persistent bibasilar atelectasis, but no new areas of consolidation
 to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Moderate-to-marked gastric distention is noted in the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen.
