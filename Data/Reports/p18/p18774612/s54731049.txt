 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:51 PM
  1. Right lower lobe volume loss with increased density of bibasilar opacities,
  right greater than left, with small bilateral pleural effusions is consistent
  with  pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia on superimposed atelectasis.
  2. No pulmonary edema.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 7:08 PM
  1. Increased density of bibasilar opacities with small bilateral pleural
  effusions is worrisome for pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia.
  2. No pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough x 9 days, diminished lung sounds in all lobes. 
 Assess for pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided.  Bibasilar consolidations with
 associated volume loss may represent atelectasis though difficult to exclude a
 superimposed pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot
 be assessed.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, possibly with superimposed pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 7:07 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
