                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer with worsening shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  The one on the right
 is slightly larger than the one on the left, and stable from the prior CT. 
 The one on the left might be very slightly increased from the prior CT. 
 Multiple nodules throughout both lungs are identified, and similar to the
 prior CT.  There is no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.  The one on the right is stable and the
 one on the left may be very slightly increased since the prior CT.
 2.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, consistent with metastases.  These
 are better evaluated on the prior CT.
 3.  No evidence of pneumonia.
