                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged, unchanged since the prior
 study, with suggestion of a small pericardial effusion, particulary on the
 lateral view. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or
 focal airspace opacity.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly and possible small pericardial effusion, likely
 not clinically significant.
