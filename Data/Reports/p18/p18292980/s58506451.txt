                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough for the past week with associated fever,
 shortness of breath, wheezing, and malaise.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Soft tissue
 attenuation causes hazy opacification over the mid to lower portions of both
 lungs.  No focal consolidations are seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  No definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute intrathoracic process, although this single AP
 radiograph is slightly limited due to body habitus and technique.  If there is
 persistent concern for an infectious process, further evaluation with PA and
 lateral radiographs could be performed.
