 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central
 line are likely unchanged in position.  There is a retrocardiac consolidation
 likely representing partial lower lobe collapse.  In addition, a patchy
 opacity at the right base is seen and this may reflect compressive atelectasis
 as there are bilateral layering effusions.  Improving mild pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax.
