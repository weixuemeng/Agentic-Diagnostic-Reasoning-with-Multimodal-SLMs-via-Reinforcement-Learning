                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  
 
 HISTORY:  Status post recent upper endoscopy with hematemesis and altered
 mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and FDG PET study dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum,
 or pleural effusion.  Streaky basilar opacities are more conspicuous in the
 right lower lung (probably within the right lower lobe) compared to the
 lingular region; these are non-specific.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumomediastinum or esophageal thickening. 
 Patchy lower lung opacities, nonspecific and probably compatible with
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, however, aspiration or
 pneumonia could be given consideration.
