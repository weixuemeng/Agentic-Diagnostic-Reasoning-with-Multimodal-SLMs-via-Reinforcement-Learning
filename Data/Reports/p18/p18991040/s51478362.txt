 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Previously noted subtle ill-defined opacity within the right lung base appears
 similar if not minimally worse when compared to the prior study.  No focal
 consolidation is present, and the left lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent ill-defined opacity within the right lung base which appears
 minimally, if at all, progressed from the prior exam, and remains concerning
 for infection.
