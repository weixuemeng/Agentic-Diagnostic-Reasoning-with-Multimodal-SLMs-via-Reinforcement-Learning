                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Coughing and short of breath, history of asthma, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits evaluation.  There is no lobar consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Slight prominence of bronchovascular markings in the lower
 lungs could indicate bronchial wall thickening or bronchovascular crowding. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia.  Slight prominence of
 bronchovasculature in the lower lung likely due to bronchovascular crowding,
 though the possibility of acute airway inflammation is not excluded given
 patient's history.
