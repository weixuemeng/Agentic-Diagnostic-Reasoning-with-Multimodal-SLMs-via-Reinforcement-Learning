 since prior examination dated ___. No focal opacity convincing for no
 pneumonia is identified. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Blunting of
 bilateral costophrenic angles may reflect small pleural effusions. Slight

 stable since prior examination. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.

 Mildly enlarged heart without evidence of overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
