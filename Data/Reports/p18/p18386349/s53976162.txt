                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 partly calcified.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged, allowing for differences in technique, however.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  There is again mildly exaggerated kyphotic angulation
 associated with unchanged loss in height among several mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
