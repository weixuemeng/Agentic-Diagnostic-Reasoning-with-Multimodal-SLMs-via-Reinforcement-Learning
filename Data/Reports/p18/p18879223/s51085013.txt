 Severe pulmonary opacification in the right lung which worsened on ___ has
 progressed since earlier in the day.  I do not believe there has been any
 interval decrease in the volume of fluid in the left pneumonectomy space to
 suggest a stump leak.  There is no right pneumothorax.  Mediastinum is still
 shifted mildly into the left hemi thorax.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Left subclavian infusion port and PIC line end
 in the lower and mid SVC respectively.
