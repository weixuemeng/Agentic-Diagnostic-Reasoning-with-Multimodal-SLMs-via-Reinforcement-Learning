                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CVA history p/w rhoncorous breath sounds and
 oxygen requirement (new)  // ?consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:54 from an outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is somewhat suboptimal due to slight patient motion.  Given
 this, there appears to be right lower lobe opacity which could be due to
 pneumonia, aspiration and/or atelectasis.  Linear left base atelectasis is
 noted.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Gaseous
 distention of bowel is partially imaged in the upper abdomen and not well
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lateral view somewhat suboptimal due to slight patient motion.  Right lower
 lobe opacity, could be due to pneumonia, aspiration, and/or atelectasis.
