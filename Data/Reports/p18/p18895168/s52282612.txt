 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:39 PM
  Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates normal heart size.  Comparison is made
  to radiograph dated ___.  There is been no significant interval
  changes with probable left pleural effusion.  A left PICC terminates in the
  upper superior vena cava.  Diffuse interstitial markings bilaterally are
  similar possibly reflective of pulmonary edema or alternatively an atypical
  and sections process.  Opacification in the retrocardiac region with air
  bronchograms is more conspicuous relative to prior examination for which
  infectious process is difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute renal failure  // eval for edema or
 consolidation      eval for edema or consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest imaging is a chest radiograph on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Heart size is normal and there is
 no appreciable pleural abnormality.
 
 Marked thickening of the right apical pleura may be related to to nodular lung
 lesions.  These need to be evaluated with comparison to any prior chest
 imaging to determine the chronicity.  Chest CT scanning may still be needed
 for evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
