                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness, L axillary rhonchi  // Eval for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC.There is diffuse increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally which may be due to moderate pulmonary edema
 and/or atypical infection.  A more focal opacity is seen in the lateral right
 lower lung, which could also relate to infection.  There is prominent right
 apical thickening.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The partially
 imaged humeral heads are high riding, which can be seen in rotator cuff
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally could be due to
 pulmonary edema, atypical infection, or related to chronic lung disease ; no
 prior chest radiographs available for comparison.
 More focal opacity at the lateral right lung base could be due to infection.
 
 Prominent right apical thickening, possibly pleural ; recommend comparison
 with remote prior chest radiographs to assess for chronicity, otherwise,
 followup outpatient chest CT for further assessment.
