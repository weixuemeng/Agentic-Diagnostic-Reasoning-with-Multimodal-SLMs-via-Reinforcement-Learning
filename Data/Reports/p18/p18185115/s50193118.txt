                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:36 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with GI bleed, subsequent pulmonary edema,
 recently self extubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable and there is no appreciable pleural abnormality. 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement is mild.  There is a suggestion of greater
 opacification in the right upper lung than anywhere else.  It would be useful
 to obtain a fully  erect view to see if this is a pulmonary abnormality such
 as developing pneumonia or overlying soft tissue.  Findings were discussed
 with the house officer at 10:20 a.m.
