                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoking history with wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Some flattening of the hemidiaphragms with hyperexpansion suggests
 chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.
