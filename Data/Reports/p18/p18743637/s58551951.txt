                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, as seen previously.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected.
 Linear density projecting over the right mid lung field appears unchanged and
 likely represents scarring or atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs without radiographic evidence for acute change.
