                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating from ___ through ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal, unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Chronic scarring at the left lung base with a
 juxta phrenic peak is unchanged.  Compared to the recent prior examination,
 there is mildly increased, subtle density at the bilateral left greater than
 right lung bases.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly increased density at the lung bases compared to the recent prior
 examination which may represent pneumonia or aspiration.  Dependent pulmonary
 edema is a less likely consideration.
