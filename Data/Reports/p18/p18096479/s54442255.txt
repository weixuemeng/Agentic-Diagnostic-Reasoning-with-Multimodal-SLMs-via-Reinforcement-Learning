                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and chest pain.  Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are
 normally expanded without focal airspace consolidation.  There is chronic
 scarring or pleural thickening at the left lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The costophrenic sulci are sharp.  The retrosternal clear space
 is opacified, but when referring to the next most recent CT of the chest, this
 represents mediastinal fat.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
