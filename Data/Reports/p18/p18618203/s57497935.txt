                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  New confluent left lower lobe opacity is best visualized on the
 lateral radiograph and partially obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  There is
 also an apparent new patchy opacity at the right lung base in the infrahilar
 region.  A poorly defined opacity in the right upper lobe at the level of the
 right third anterior rib may correspond to a nodular opacity present in this
 region on prior chest CTA of ___.  Linear scar or atelectasis is
 present at the right lung base.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Note is made of previous sternotomy
 with fracture of the first sternal wire.  Degenerative changes are present in
 the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Confluent left lower lobe and patchy right lower lobe opacities, which may
 represent aspiration pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity.
 
 2.  Poorly defined peripheral right upper lobe opacity, possibly corresponding
 to the site of a lung nodule on chest CTA of ___.  
 
 Once the lower lobe opacities have cleared on followup chest radiographs,
 consider a followup chest CT to assess for possible interval growth of the
 right upper lobe abnormality, which could potentially represent an early focus
 of lung neoplasm.
