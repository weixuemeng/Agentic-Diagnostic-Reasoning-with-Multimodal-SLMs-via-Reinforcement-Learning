 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD not on home O2, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL,
 pAF, h/o CVA, alcohol abuse, here for CAP. s/p full course treatment for CAP,
 off abx, with new fever. Working up new or progressive infection.  // evidence

 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Midline sternotomy wires are well aligned.  Right sided
 PICC now terminates in right axilla.  The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature unremarkable.  Again noted is right paratracheal soft tissue,
 consistent with known lymphadenopathy.  Diffuse, patchy, right-sided opacity
 is progressed since the most recent examination.  Left basilar opacity is more
 prominent as well. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacities throughout the right lung and left lung base have
 worsened.  Given waxing and waning over serial radiographs, there is concern
 for recurrent aspiration/aspiration pneumonia.
