                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior aspiration pneumonia with possible cavitary lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  The right upper lung process most likely reflects fibrotic healing of
 previously described lesion.  Fracture of the most superior sternal wires is
 again seen.  Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits, and there is no
 evidence of vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.  Probable atelectatic
 changes at the left base.
