                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTA chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again visualized are bilateral heterogeneous parenchymal opacities, involving
 the left lung greater than right, with mid and lower lung predominance. This
 has decreased in comparison to the prior radiograph but increased in
 comparison to the more recent prior CT.  Cardiac silhouette appears normal.
 Median sternotomy wires appear unchanged. Surgical clips are seen in the right
 upper lobe with adjacent scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nonspecific asymmetrically distributed heterogeneous lung opacities, which may
 represent asymmetrical edema, multifocal aspiration or infection.
