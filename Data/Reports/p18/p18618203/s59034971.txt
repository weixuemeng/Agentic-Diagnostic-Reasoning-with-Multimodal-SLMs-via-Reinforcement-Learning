                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, here to evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 30 minutes earlier at 4:15 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating
 approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen coursing to
 the mid-to-lower esophagus but not below the diaphragm.  The overall
 appearance of the chest is unchanged from the study performed 30 minutes
 earlier with patchy opacification at the right lung, predominantly in the
 right lung base and the left lung base as well compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enteric tube in the mid-to-lower esophagus, should be advanced to place in
 the stomach.
 2.  Endotracheal tube in good position.
 3.  Otherwise unchanged appearance of the chest with multifocal pneumonia.
