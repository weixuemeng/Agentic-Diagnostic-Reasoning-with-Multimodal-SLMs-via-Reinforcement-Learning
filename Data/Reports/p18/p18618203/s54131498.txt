                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, SOB  // ?acute change      ?acute
 change
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. The
 cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal with continued
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Poor definition of the left
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering effusion and atelectatic changes. In
 the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 Of incidental note is a break in the uppermost sternal wire.
