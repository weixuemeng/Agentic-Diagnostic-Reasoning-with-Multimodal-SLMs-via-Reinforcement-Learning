                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD, now with decreased oxygen saturation, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased.  Multifocal
 airspace opacities are seen throughout the right lung, predominantly in the
 right lung base as well as the left lung base compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated due to low lung volumes but is likely within normal
 limits.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with tortuosity of
 the aorta.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with discontinuity of
 the two superior most wires.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia.
