                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, rule out pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The
 diaphragms are flat consistent with hyperinflation.  The cardiomediastinal,
 pleural, and pulmonary structures are unremarkable.  There is some linear
 atelectasis versus scarring at the left lung base.  There are no
 consolidations to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and median sternotomy
 wires are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
