                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 mild widening of the right paratracheal stripe suggestive of underlying
 lymphadenopathy, as seen previously.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are continued ill-defined patchy opacities within the left lung base as
 well as within the right upper and mid lung fields, reflective of chronic
 changes.  Slightly increased patchy opacification in the retrocardiac region
 could reflect superimposed left lower lobe atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued chronic changes within the right upper and mid lung fields as well
 the left lung base.  Slightly increased opacification in the retrocardiac
 region could reflect worsening left lower lobe atelectasis though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
