                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with COPD, recent hospitalization for
 pneumonia last month, repeat chest examination of ___ with worsening
 infiltrates, evaluate for progression.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged in size and is within normal limits. 
 Status post sternotomy as before.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and
 has not changed from the preceding examination.  The on the next preceding
 examination identified multiple patchy infiltrates within the right hemithorax
 and suspected to include atypical infection and pulmonary hemorrhage or
 pulmonary drug reaction have regressed.  The present appearance of the lung is
 similar to what has been described on the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.  In the area of concern at that time, which was overlying the
 second right-sided intercostal space, no new appreciable parenchymal
 infiltrate or mass density has developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in patient with rather advanced COPD. 
 Sternotomy was related to two-vessel bypass grafting as described in medical
 records.
