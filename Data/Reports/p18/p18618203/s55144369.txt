                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate sternal wires, some of
 which are fractured but unchanged compared to prior chest radiograph.  There
 is a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are fairly well-aerated. 
 Again seen is bilateral asymmetric parenchymal abnormality, with a reticular
 appearance of the right hemi thorax, similar in appearance to multiple prior
 exams.  A recurrent left lower lobe heterogeneous consolidation raises concern
 for recurrent aspiration pneumonia.  There is also a somewhat more nodular
 focus just below the right clavicle.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Recurrent left lower lobe heterogeneous consolidation, concerning for
 recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
 2. Within a region of pre-existing scarring in the right upper lobe is a more
 focal nodular opacity just below the right clavicle, not fully evaluable on
 today's exam due to AP projection and patient rotation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up radiograph for weeks after completion of
 treatment is recommended evaluate for resolution of the left lower lobe
 process and to reassess a nodular opacity in the right upper lobe.
