  Again seen are bilateral diffuse heterogeneous opacities, overall minimally
  improved in the right lung, and progressed in the left lung.  These findings
  are superimposed on reticular opacities, which are largely similar to the
  prior examination.  New opacity seen in the left lung base.  This may
  represent consolidation in the appropriate clinical context.  A vague, deep
  sulcus sign may be seen on the left.  Repeat imaging in a more upright
  position may be considered for better evaluation, to rule out pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB after lying flat for central line
 removal w acute SOB  // possible aspiration when flat vs. air embolism
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral extensive heterogeneous opacities throughout the lungs consistent
 with aspiration have improved on the right and worsened on the left. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The mediastinum is widened,
 mediastinal lymph nodes were better seen on prior CT.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is asymmetric larger on the right, stable.  Denser consolidation in
 the left lower lobe could be atelectasis or a larger area of aspiration. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
