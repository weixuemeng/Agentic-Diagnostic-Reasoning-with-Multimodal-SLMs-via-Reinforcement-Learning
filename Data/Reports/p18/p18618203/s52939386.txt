                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with unchanged fractures of the 2
 superior most wires.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Mild probe vascular congestion is present.  Patchy opacities
 are seen within the right mid lung field as well as within both lung bases,
 not substantially changed in the interval, and may be reflective of chronic or
 recurrent aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Calcifications in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen likely reflect
 cholelithiasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Patchy opacities in the right mid lung field as well as both lung bases,
 similar to the previous exam, may reflect chronic or recurrent aspiration.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Cholelithiasis.
