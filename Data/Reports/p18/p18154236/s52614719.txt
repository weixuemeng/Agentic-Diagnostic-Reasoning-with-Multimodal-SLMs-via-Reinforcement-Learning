                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with likely MRSA pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a right PICC.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The hilar contours are unchanged.  Stable mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is an unchanged, small left pleural effusion with
 interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis.  A new focal opacity at the
 right base with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm may reflect interval
 increase in pleural fluid with adjacent atelectasis; however, superimposed
 pneumonia should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New focal opacity at the right base may reflect interval enlargement of a
 right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, superimposed
 pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.
