                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening DOE, ___ edema  // r/o CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta are stable along with symmetrical narrowing of the proximal
 thoracic trachea from a known goiter. Bilateral reticular interstitial
 opacities are less severe than on the prior radiograph and likely represent
 interstitial edema in the setting of clinical signs of CHF. Short-term
 followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to document resolution
 and to exclude a more chronic interstitial abnormality.
 
 A right superior mediastinal mass is also a persistent finding and has been
 more fully evaluated on older CT. Followup chest CT would be helpful to
 confirm stability and to exclude a slowly growing mass in this region.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:46 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
