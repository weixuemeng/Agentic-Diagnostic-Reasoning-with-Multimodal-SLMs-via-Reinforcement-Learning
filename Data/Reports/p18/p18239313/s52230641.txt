                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with persistent retrocardiac opacification consistent with some combination of
 left effusion, atelectasis, and possible superimposed pneumonia.  Right
 basilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis, though the possibility of
 aspiration or developing consolidation would have to be considered.
