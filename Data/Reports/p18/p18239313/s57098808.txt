 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard
 position.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Persistent dense left retrocardiac opacity
 which may be due to atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation, accompanied
 by a moderate left pleural effusion.  Subtle poorly defined opacities in the
 right lower lobe may reflect atelectasis, aspiration or an early focus of
 pneumonia.
