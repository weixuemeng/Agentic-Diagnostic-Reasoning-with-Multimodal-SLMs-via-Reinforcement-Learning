                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded with increased interstitial markings
 which likely reflect chronic changes due to a nonspecific fibrotic lung
 disease as on the prior CT. Increased bibasilar opacities may reflect
 superimposed atelectasis; however aspiration would be difficult to exclude. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size
 with normal mediastinal and hilar contours aside from enlarged pulmonary
 arteries consistent with provided history of pulmonary hypertension.  Proximal
 left clavicular fracture is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: Chronic fibrotic changes with superimposed increased basilar
 opacities which could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
