                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and earlier CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Central pulmonary arteries are
 substantially enlarged, as seen previously.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild reticulation at the lung bases suggesting an interstitial process appears
 unchanged without clear evidence for superimposed focal opacity.  Two fiducial
 seeds project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar pulmonary artery enlargement and interstitial abnormality
 in the lungs, but no clear evidence for superimposed acute disease.
