                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and
 shortness breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There are vague basilar opacities, most
 consistent with bibasilar atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear without
 consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 bilateral hila are prominent.  The hila were previously evaluated on the prior
 CT, and appear prominent due to the configuration of the normal vasculature. 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
