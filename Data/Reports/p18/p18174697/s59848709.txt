                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastatic CA s/p T6 spine lesion resection
 with poor quality lung sounds and wet cough  // Evaluate for lung
 consolidation     Evaluate for lung consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is suggestion of some increased
 opacification at the bases, most likely representing atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 Otherwise, no change with no evidence of appreciable vascular congestion or
 pleural effusion.
 Of incidental note are multiple spinal surgical procedures in the thoracic and
 cervical regions.
