                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, IABP  // Balloon pump position?
 Interval change?      Balloon pump position? Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 7:49 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is 7 cm in the apex of the aortic knob,
 previously 5 cm below the knob.  This variation can occur with no
 repositioning of the pump, reflecting instead patient posterior, particularly
 hip flexion.
 
 
 Right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the left pulmonary artery, as
 before.  Left trans subclavian right atrial and biventricular pacer
 defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions.  As before
 the intended atrial lead is more medially than generally seen. Its proper
 functioning should be confirmed clinically.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Pleural
 effusions, if present, are not large.  No pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr. ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 11:32 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
