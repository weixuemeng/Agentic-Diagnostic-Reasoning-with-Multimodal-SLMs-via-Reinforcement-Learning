 Mild pulmonary edema is new.  Opacification at the left lung base is also new

 abnormalities.

 peripheral and would need to be withdrawn at least 8 cm to reposition it in
 the right main pulmonary artery.

 ___, due to progressive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  It
 should be noted that pericardial effusion is often associated with left
 pleural effusion, already noted has greater today than previously.

 device are unchanged in their respective positions.
