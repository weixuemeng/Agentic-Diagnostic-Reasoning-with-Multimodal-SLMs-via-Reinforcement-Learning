                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  This image was just presented for interpretation. In comparison with
 the previous study of this date, there may be slight increase in the degree of
 left apical pneumothorax. Otherwise, little change in the bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications. The right Swan-Ganz catheter is been pulled back into the
 pulmonary outflow tract.

 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:22 AM
  Increased size of small to moderate left apical pneumothorax from the most
  recent prior study performed 7 hr earlier. Interval extubation and removal of
  the enteric tube and right PICC.
  
  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
  ___ at 9:21 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
  
  MAIN REPORT:  Indications: VA ED and right apical pneumothorax.
  
  Comparisons: Earlier on the same day.
  
  Technique: Chest, portable AP semi-uright.
  
  
  FINDINGS
  Patient has been extubated. An orogastric tube was removed. A PICC line was
  also removed. There is still a pulmonary arterial catheter in place as well as
  mediastinal drains. A dual lead pacemaker/ ICD device appears unchanged. There
  is a increased left-sided pneumothorax. Superior margin of the lung lies 4 cm
  below the inner wall of the apex of the left chest. Pulmonary edema is
  similar.
  
  Impression: Persistent pulmonary edema. Increase in left apical pneumothorax.
  Status post endotracheal intubation.
