 INDICATION:  New increased work of breathing. Evaluate for change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.  This

 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC terminating in the low SVC and an ICD/pacemaker are unchanged. 
 There is no change in the right perihilar opacity, which based on the
 subsequent CT, is consistent with edema. The other areas of moderate pulmonary
 edema have slightly improved. There is no new opacity. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size remains moderately enlarged. The
 mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in the moderate pulmonary edema.
