 There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is possible
 cortical irregularity of the right scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Chronic mild interstitial abnormality can be seen in chronic asthma. There
 is no acute abnormality. 
 2. Cortical irregularity of the right scapula is likely artifact but fracture
 can be considered if pain is referable to this area.
