                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with productive cough  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided. Apical pleural thickening is again
 noted, grossly unchanged from prior study.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 prominent retrosternal clear space, likely due to underlying COPD.   There is
 no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Again seen is a mild anterior wedge
 deformity in the mid thoracic spine, grossly unchanged from comparison study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD without superimposed acute process.  Prominent apical scarring.
 Consider nonemergent outpatient CT to further assess given extensive
 background emphysema.
