 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal surgical clips and sternal wires
 are unchanged.  Severe mitral annular calcifications are again noted.  The
 lungs are well inflated with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  Subpleural increase in opacity along the
 posterior and inferior lungs is likely a function of fibrotic changes.
 Osseous structures demonstrate osteopenia, but no evidence of fracture.

 Chronic changes including moderate cardiomegaly, but no evidence of pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema.
