                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, worse w/ exertion  // ? pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy wires
 and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. 
 Curvilinear calcification projecting over the heart on the lateral projection
 likely reflects valvular disease.  Hilar congestion is noted with mild to
 moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  No large effusions are seen.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is within normal limits.  Calcification
 projecting over the mediastinum at the left apex is unchanged and may
 correspond with thyroid.  Bony structures appear intact though high riding
 right humeral head is noted likely reflecting chronic right rotator cuff
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial pulmonary edema.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.
