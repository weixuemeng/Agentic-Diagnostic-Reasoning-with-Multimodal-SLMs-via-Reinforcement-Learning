                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is very
 subtle patchy opacity at the lateral left upper lung which may relate to
 atelectasis, although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The remainder of the lungs is clear.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacity lateral left upper lung most likely relates
 to atelectasis and possible vessels; however, early consolidation cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
