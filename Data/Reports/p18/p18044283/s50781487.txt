                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Vomiting and syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is
 seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Mild bibasilar
 opacities most likely relate to atelectasis versus aspiration rather than
 infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is
 calcified.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Minimal biapical pleural
 thickening is seen.  Old left clavicular fracture is noted.  The inferior-most
 sternal wire is fractured.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar opacities, most likely due to atelectasis or
 possibly aspiration.
