                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rollover motor vehicle collision with chest injury.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This limits assessment of the lung bases where there
 are mild bibasilar streaky opacities.  The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
