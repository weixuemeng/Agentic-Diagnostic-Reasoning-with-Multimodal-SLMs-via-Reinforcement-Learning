  ET tube in appropriate position 4 cm above the carina.  Intra-aortic balloon
  pump is located slightly low in the descending thoracic aorta and could be
  advanced approximately 2 cm.  Enteric tube courses to the stomach with the tip
  beyond the lower field of view.  Bilateral hazy opacities with prominence and
  indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature compatible with pulmonary edema. 
  There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is no large pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Flash pulmonary edema, evaluation of device placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina.  The aortic
 balloon pump is located approximately 2 cm below the top aspect of the aortic
 arch.  There is gastric overinflation despite the normal placement of a
 nasogastric tube.  The patient shows signs of likely acute relatively massive
 pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 No larger pleural effusion.
