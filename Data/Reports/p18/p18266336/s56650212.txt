                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with question of empyema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates increased pleural
 effusion with atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left lung base.  A
 circumscribed thick-walled cavitary lesion measuring 4.7 cm in the left mid
 lung is similar as compared to prior exams and well correlated to a large
 pulmonary abscess on preceding CT from one day prior.  The left upper lung and
 right lung appear relatively well aerated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes and AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lung cavitary lesion consistent with pulmonary abscess.
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.
