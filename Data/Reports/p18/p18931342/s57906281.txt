                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for weeks with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia or a
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.  The lung volumes are
 exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures and
 bilateral atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are likely unchanged,
 accounting for low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, without a definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
