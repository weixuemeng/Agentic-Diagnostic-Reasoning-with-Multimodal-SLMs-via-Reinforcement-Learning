                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Cardiomediastinal widening appears similar compared to the prior study
 allowing for marked rightward patient's rotation.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by mild edema.  Moderate right pleural effusion has
 decreased in size, but a small left pleural effusion is apparently new. 
 Persistent bilateral retrocardiac opacities which probably reflect
 atelectasis.
