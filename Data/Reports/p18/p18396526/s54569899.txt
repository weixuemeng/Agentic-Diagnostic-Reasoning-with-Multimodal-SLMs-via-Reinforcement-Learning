                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged due to cardiomyopathy and/or pericardial
 effusion.  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  A dual-lead left-sided
 pacer device is seen.  The distal aspect of the leads are not seen due to
 underpenetration at the lower hemithorax.  The hemidiaphragms are partially
 obscured but could relate to underpenetration, although there may also be a
 right-sided pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is mild prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature which could in part relate to low lung volumes.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Underpenetration of the lung bases which may be related to
 patient body habitus, and low lung volumes make exam suboptimal.  Given this,
 opacity at the right lung base could be due to pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  Left base retrocardiac
 opacity seen may also be due to atelectasis and/or consolidation. Mild central
 pulmonary vascular prominence.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
