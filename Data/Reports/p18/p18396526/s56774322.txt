                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fever and altered mental status,
 evaluate for worsened pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position
 as before.  Considerable cardiac enlargement is present.  Pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates perivascular haze compatible with marked congestion. 
 There is evidence of a right-sided pleural effusion obliterating the
 diaphragmatic contours and blunting the lateral pleural sinus.  Less prominent
 left-sided pleural effusion as the left lateral pleural sinus appears free. 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and the metallic component of a mitral
 valve prosthesis is seen in place.  Also noted is the presence of
 biventricular epicardial pacing wires with the left-sided electrode entered
 into the coronary sinus and placed in an obtuse marginal coronary vein
 activating the left ventricular lateral structures.  The previously described
 (placed on ___) PICC line remains in unchanged position and no
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiac enlargement on biventricular pacing device. 
 Chronic pulmonary vascular congestion with pleural effusions more marked on
 the right.  No evidence of new parenchymal pulmonary abnormalities as can be
 identified on this single view chest examination.
