                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with sepsis and bacteremia, intubated.  Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 AP chest at 3:41 compared to ___ 4:09 a.m.
 
 The severity of mild to moderate pulmonary edema is exaggerated by increasing
 large bilateral pleural effusions which are responsible for substantial
 bibasilar atelectasis, also worsening.  There is no pneumothorax.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is a chronic problem, but never worse.  Mediastinal caliber
 suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume or both.  ET tube is in
 standard placement, an upper enteric drainage tube can be traced only as far
 as the mid esophagus, although it may go further, a right jugular line and
 ends in the mid to low SVC.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads are probably in standard positions, although the atrial lead is
 partially obscured.
