                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with CHF history, asthma presents with shortness of
 breath and productive cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Increased interstitial markings are again
 seen suggesting \vascular congestion.  Increased opacity at the right
 costophrenic angle on the frontal may be due to underpenetration and overlying
 soft tissues.  There is no definite effusion.  On the lateral view, there is
 slightly more conspicuous retrocardiac opacity on when compared to prior 2
 view.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged, notable for aortic and
 mitral valve replacements triple lead pacing device.  Median sternotomy wires
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.  More conspicuous retrocardiac opacity on the
 lateral view may be due to atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion
 superimposed on normal structures however infection is not completely
 excluded.
