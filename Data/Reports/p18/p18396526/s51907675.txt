                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Mitral valve regurgitation, congestive heart failure
 and biventricular pacer with weight gain over last months to exclude pulmonary
 edema.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and multiple prior studies.
 
 The biventricular pacemaker leads are located in expected positions projecting
 over the right ventricle, epicardial vein of the left ventricle.  The heart
 size is enlarged but unchanged.  The replaced mitral and aortic valve are
 projecting in expected positions as well.  The sternal wires are unremarkable
 except for broken inferior wire, unchanged since the prior study.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
