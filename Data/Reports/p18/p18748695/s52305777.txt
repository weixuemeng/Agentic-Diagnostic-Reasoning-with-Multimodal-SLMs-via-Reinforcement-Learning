                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with fever to 104, sore throat,
 nausea for one day.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes.  Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity could relate
 to atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting an early
 consolidation due to infection is not excluded.  The right lung is clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity could relate to
 atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting an early
 consolidation due to infection is not entirely excluded.
