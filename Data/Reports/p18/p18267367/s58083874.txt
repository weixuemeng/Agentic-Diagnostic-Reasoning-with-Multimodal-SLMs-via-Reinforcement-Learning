 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder, weakness for 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal accounting for the low lung
 volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
