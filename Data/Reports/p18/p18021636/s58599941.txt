                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Linear bibasilar opacities
 most likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD.  The heart
 size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There is a cardiac pacer with
 leads ending in the right ventricle and right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs are suggestive of COPD. Linear opacities in
 the right greater than the lower lobe represent atelectasis.
