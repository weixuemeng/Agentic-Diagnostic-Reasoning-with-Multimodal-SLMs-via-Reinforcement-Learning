 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, known rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Normal lung volumes.  Large hiatal hernia.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 At the site of a former nondisplaced fracture, with respect to the sixth rib
 on the right, the fracture is now moderately displaced.  On the current image,
 no further fractures are visible other than the previous nondisplaced rib
 fractures documented on the CT examination from ___.
 
 There is no evidence of complications such as pneumothorax or pleural
 effusions.
