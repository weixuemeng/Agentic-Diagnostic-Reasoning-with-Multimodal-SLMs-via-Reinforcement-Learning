                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:13 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.  Suspect pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is
 partially obscured by markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm, and attendant
 atelectasis, exacerbated by worsening of severe gaseous distention of the
 stomach.  Pulmonary edema is mild, if any.  New opacification at the right
 lung base could be due to aspiration or atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable in size. 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:30 a.m. and we discussed the findings by
 telephone at 9:35.
