                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bump on right neck, likely a lymph node.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Hilar
 contours are normal, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Asymmetric opacity which is ill-defined in the right lung apex is nonspecific.
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Asymmetric ill-defined opacity within the right lung apex.  This could reflect
 an area of scarring, but infection cannot be excluded.  Correlation with any
 prior radiographs and clinical history is recommended; if no prior studies are
 available for comparison, then a short interval follow up radiograph is
 suggested after treatment.
