                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with rib pain status post fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size remains mild
 to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta is
 unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Linear opacities in the left lower lobe likely reflect
 subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No displaced fracture is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subsegmental left lower lobe atelectasis.  No displaced fracture identified.
 If there is continued concern for rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib
 series.
