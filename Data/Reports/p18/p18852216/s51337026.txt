                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, to assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, area of
 increased opacification at the left base has cleared.  This may reflect
 removal of a mucus plug with reexpansion of a portion of the left lower lobe. 
 No evidence of pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Endotracheal tube tip lies
 approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  Right subclavian catheter is in the
 upper portion of the SVC.
