 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Elevated white blood count and fever.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by
 the low lung volumes.  Aside from improving opacities in the left lower lobe
 that are likely atelectasis, the lungs are clear.  Pulmonary edema has
 resolved.  There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural
 effusion.
