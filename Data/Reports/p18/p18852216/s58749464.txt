                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent seizures, for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 lies approximately 2 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian catheter tip
 is in the mid SVC.
 
 There are lower lung volumes with bibasilar atelectatic changes and possible
 small pleural effusions.  There also may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure, though this also could reflect the lower lung volumes.
