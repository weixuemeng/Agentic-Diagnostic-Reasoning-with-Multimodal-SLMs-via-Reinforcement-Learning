                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, pre-MRI post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral apical opacities,
 particularly on the left, may be early pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting. Would recommend follow up of this area.  Cardiac size is normal.
