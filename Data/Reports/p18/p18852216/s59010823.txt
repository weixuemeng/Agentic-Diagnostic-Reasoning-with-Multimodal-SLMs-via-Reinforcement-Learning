                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position, and a right PICC
 continues to terminate at the expected junction of the right subclavian and
 right brachiocephalic veins.  Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior
 study with associated accentuation of cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely
 represent atelectasis, but aspiration and pneumonia are additional
 considerations for the left lower lobe opacity.  Small left pleural effusion
 is evident, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
