  prominent upper right mediastinum with obscuration of portion of right
  paratracheal stripe. Findings may relate to mediastinal lipomatosis exagerated
  by AP technique and low lung volumes.  However, there is also a possible
  adjacent right upper lobe opacification with signs of collapse including right
  hilar and right hemidiaphragm elevation. Underlying infection/mass cannot be
  excluded. Given no comparison XR, recommend evaluation with conventional PA
  and lateral CXR if pt able to tolerate. ___

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Febrile, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  As the lung volumes are low.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Moderate increase
 in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, notably in the perihilar areas,
 which suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, notably as combines to
 slightly enlarged azygos vein.  No other lung parenchymal changes, in
 particular no evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
