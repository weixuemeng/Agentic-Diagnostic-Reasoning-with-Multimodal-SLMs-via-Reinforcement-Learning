                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dyspnea and vomiting.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are present which cause crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. There is no pulmonary edema. There has been
 interval removal of the right-sided PIC line.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 There is a tracheostomy tube, with an overlying rebreather mask limiting
 assessment of the upper lungs. There is mild right basilar atelectasis. There
 is a patchy opacity in the left lung base, which could be secondary to
 atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be ruled out. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is likely present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lung could be secondary to atelectasis,
 however pneumonia cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion.
