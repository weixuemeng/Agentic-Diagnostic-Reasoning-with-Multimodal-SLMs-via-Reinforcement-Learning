                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF, moderate aortic stenosis, presenting with progressive
 dyspnea and DOE x 2 days, assess for edema, pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes limit evaluation.  There are bilateral pulmonary opacities which are
 most confluent in the lung bases.  Central pulmonary hilar engorgement with
 interstitial and alveolar edema is present.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 small to moderate.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size appears enlarged though
 poorly assessed.  Mediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic
 calcification along the aortic knob.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pulmonary edema/heart failure. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions also present.
