                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right sided PICC.  Confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided PICC line terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic
 vein/ proximal SVC.  The tip however is difficult to visualized. There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided PICC line likely terminates at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic vein/ proximal SVC, however the tip is not definitely
 identified on this portable examination.  PA and lateral chest radiographs may
 be helpful for further delineation.
