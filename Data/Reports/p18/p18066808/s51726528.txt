                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Assessment of the right PICC line tip placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Repepated radiograph demonstrates the right PICC line with its tip most likely
 terminating at the level of superior SVC.  It cannot be seen beyond that
 point.  The lateral view confirms this observation.  Heart size and
 mediastinum appears to be unchanged since the prior study and the lungs are
 clear.
 
 If a clinical concern about the position of the right PICC line is present,
 repositioning is required.
