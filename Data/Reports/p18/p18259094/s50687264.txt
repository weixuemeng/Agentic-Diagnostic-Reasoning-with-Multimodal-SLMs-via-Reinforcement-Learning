                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and malaise, assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate moderate to severe cardiac
 enlargement, stable from priors. Mediastinal widening, secondary to
 mediastinal lipomatosis, is also unchanged.  Lymphadenopathy is better
 appreciated on chest CT from ___.  There is no pleural effusion.
 Homogeneous opacification of the lungs bilaterally is likely secondary to body
 habitus. There is no definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
 Pulmonary artery enlargement suggests pulmonary artery hypertension.   There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Homogeneous opacification of the lungs bilaterally likely relates to body
 habitus, and makes a subtle consolidation difficult to exclude.
