                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Assessment of fine detail is considerably limited by overlying soft tissues
 and underpenetration.  Allowing for this, there is marked enlargement of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to ___ at 7:35 a.m.  Possibility of
 a patchy opacity at the right base, with involvement of the lower lobe, cannot
 be excluded.  Doubt gross effusion. Possible mild vascular plethora, though
 this appears improved compared with the earlier film. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to overlying soft tissues.  Severe cardiomegaly
 persists.  Possibility of a right lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  Small right effusion cannot be excluded.
