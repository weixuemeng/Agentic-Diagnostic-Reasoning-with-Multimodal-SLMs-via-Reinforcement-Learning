 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:11 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been
  interval improvement of right basilar opacity.  However, there are persistent
  bibasilar opacities for which an underlying infectious process cannot be
  excluded.  There is persistent widening of the mediastinum with cardiomegaly. 
  Probable bilateral small pleural effusions.  There is mild pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE ___ AT 18:22
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with atrial fibrillation, CHF, now with an
 acute upper GI bleed, increasing white count with wheezing and altered mental
 status.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 18:22 was submitted and compared
 to prior study of ___ at 10:54.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent bibasilar opacities with some associated effusions most likely
 representing compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia or
 aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  Low lung volumes with crowding of the
 vasculature and interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax. Degenerative
 changes of both glenohumeral joints.
