                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated,
 similar compared to the previous exam.  Widening of the mediastinum is also
 unchanged, and attributable to the presence of mediastinal lipomatosis. 
 Aortic contour is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema, with right
 basilar opacification likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and a
 small right pleural effusion.  Patchy left basilar opacity is also noted and a
 small left pleural effusion cannot be fully excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted with
 degenerative spurring and subchondral sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema.  
 
 2. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though
 aspiration or infection are not excluded.  Small right pleural effusion, and
 possible trace left pleural effusion.
