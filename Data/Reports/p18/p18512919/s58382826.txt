                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post EBUS/TBNA and airway stent placement.  Please
 evaluate stent.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable examination
 with increased density and irregular contour of the mediastinal and right
 suprahilar regions correlating with mediastinal mass evident on the ___ chest CT with distal right upper lobe opacification thought to represent
 post-obstructive pneumonia.  There is widening of the distal trachea just
 above the level of the carina, 2.7 cm compared to 1.5 cm, consistent with
 placement of reportedly Y-shaped stent.  The bronchial components of the stent
 are not visible radiographically.  No other nodule is identified.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of Y-shaped tracheobronchial stent with
 visible patent tracheal portion.  Bronchial limbs are not sufficiently
 radiopaque but appear grossly patent.  Stable mediastinal/hilar contour
 irregularity and right upper lobe peripheral opacification consistent with
 known mass and associated post-obstructive pneumonia.
