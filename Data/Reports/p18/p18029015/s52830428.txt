                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  There is similar mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta as well as calcification visualized along the
 arch.  There is a new small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion that
 prominently layers along the right lateral chest wall as well as new patchy
 right basilar opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  The lateral view
 suggests a developing posterior consolidation in the right lower lobe.  There
 are also new small patchy left basilar opacities obscuring the lateral side of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  Fissures are also thickened reflecting pleural fluid
 on the right. Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Developing right lower lobe consolidation with a new right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis, not specific and
 potentially reflecting either an additional focus of pneumonia or atelectasis.
