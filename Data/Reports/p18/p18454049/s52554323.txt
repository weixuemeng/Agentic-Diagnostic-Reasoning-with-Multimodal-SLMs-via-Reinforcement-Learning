                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Persistent ill-defined
 opacities within both lung bases are perhaps minimally worse in the interval
 with probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Mild degenerative changes are noted
 in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perhaps slight interval worsening of bibasilar ill-defined opacities
 concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
