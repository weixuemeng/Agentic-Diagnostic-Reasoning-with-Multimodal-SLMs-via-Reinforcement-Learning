                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intermittent chest pain and dyspnea on
 exertion for 1 week.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Extremely low lung volumes are seen
 with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Superimposed
 intersitial edema is also possible.  There is blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle, potentially due to small effusion or potentially a
 Bochdalek's hernia.  There is also slightly more focal opacity at the right
 lung base potentially atelectasis although infection is not excluded. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 Repeat exam can be performed with improved inspiratory effort to further
 characterize all of the above findings.
