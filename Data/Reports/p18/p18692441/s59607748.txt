                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted as well as diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base likely reflects minor
 atelectasis.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with anterior
 osteophyte formation are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
