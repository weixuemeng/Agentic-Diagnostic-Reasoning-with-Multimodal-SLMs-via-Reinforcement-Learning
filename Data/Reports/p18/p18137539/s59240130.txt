                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OGT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an
 OG tube that extends to the upper stomach with the side hole beyond the
 esophagogastric junction.  Endotracheal tube position is unchanged and the
 lungs remain clear.  The curious opacification described previously just to
 the right of T9 is unchanged.
