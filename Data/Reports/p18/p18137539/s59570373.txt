  Severe pulmonary edema has improved. Remaining interstitial abnormality is
  most likely residual edema, however focal elements of increased opacity in the
  left upper lung and right mid to lower lung could reflect developing
  infectious process in the setting of infectious symptoms.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  The pre-existing severe pulmonary edema has
 improved.  However, interstitial markings persist, most likely reflect
 residual interstitial fluid overloads.  There is no typical appearance for
 changes consistent with pneumonia.  However, short-term followup with chest
 radiograph should be performed to verify further resolution of the changes.
