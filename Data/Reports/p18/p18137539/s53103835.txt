                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:33 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a Tylenol overdose who coughed out his
 endotracheal tube, following reintubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 3:16 a.m.
 
 With the chin down, position of the ET tube tip less than a centimeter from
 the carina is only 3 cm below optimal placement.  Severe pulmonary edema is no
 worse, and bibasilar consolidation, which could be combination of dependent
 edema and atelectasis or concurrent pneumonia, is also stable.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, but smaller today.  No pneumothorax.
 Heart size is normal.  Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  Upper enteric
 drainage catheter passes to the mid stomach.  No pneumothorax.
