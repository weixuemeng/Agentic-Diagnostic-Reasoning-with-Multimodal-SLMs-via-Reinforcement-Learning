 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with brain bleed, now with increased WOB   Wheeze
 // ?pneumonia, fluid status      ?pneumonia, fluid status
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has persisted following improvement after
 ___.  There has been consistently more opacification in the left lower
 lobe which can be explained by lymphatic occlusion due to left hilar
 adenopathy which greatly exceeds that on the right.  Unfortunately I can't
 exclude concurrent pneumonia.  Heart is normal size.  Right pleural effusion
 minimal if any.
 Left pic line ends in the low SVC.
