                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA head and neck ___ at 18:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient positioning.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinum appears to be due to
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy as seen on the previous CTA of the neck. 
 Bilateral hilar enlargement also may be due to underlying lymphadenopathy.
 Mild pulmonary edema is present. Additionally there are scattered ill-defined
 nodular opacities throughout the lungs diffusely. A trace left pleural
 effusion may be present, but no large right pleural effusion is seen, however
 the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no
 pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.  Remote fracture of
 the right clavicle is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema. Trace left pleural effusion.
 2. Widened superior mediastinum and bilateral hilar enlargement likely due to
 underlying lymphadenopathy.
 3. Diffuse nodular opacities, as seen on the recent CTA, but not clearly well
 visualized. Findings which could suggest small airways infection,
 inflammation, or aspiration.  Metastatic disease is not completely excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 CT of the chest is recommended for further assessment.
