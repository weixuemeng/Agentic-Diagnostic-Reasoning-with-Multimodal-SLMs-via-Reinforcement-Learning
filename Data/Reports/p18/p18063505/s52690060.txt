                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp distress  // fluid status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A feeding tube enters the stomach.  A left PICC line terminates in the low
 SVC.  There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Bilateral perihilar
 airspace opacities are unchanged. Slightly increased left basilar retrocardiac
 airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis, but pneumonia or
 aspiration would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due
 to atelectasis or developing pneumonia/aspiration.
 Stable small layering left pleural effusion.
