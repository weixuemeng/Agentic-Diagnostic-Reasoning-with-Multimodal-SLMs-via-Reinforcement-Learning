                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumomediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated and clear.  No consolidation, nodule, effusion, or pneumothorax is
 present.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Linear lucencies
 projecting over the left pulmonary artery on frontal and lateral image
 correspond to previously diagnosed pneumomediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Irregular lucency surrounding the left pulmonary artery
 consistent with trace pneumomediastinum.
