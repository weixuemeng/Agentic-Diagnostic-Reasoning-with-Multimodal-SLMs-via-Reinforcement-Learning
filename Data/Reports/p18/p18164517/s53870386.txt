                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dysarthria, evaluate for infectious cause.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously seen left greater than right bibasilar heterogeneous
 opacities have improved.  There is minimal residual left basilar opacity.  A
 small left pleural effusion has decreased and is very small.  There is no
 right pleural effusion.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  A linear artifact extends through the right portion of this
 radiograph.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Minimal residual left basilar opacity although prior left lower lung
 opacities are almostly fully resolved.
 
 2.  Tiny residual left pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Persistent mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
