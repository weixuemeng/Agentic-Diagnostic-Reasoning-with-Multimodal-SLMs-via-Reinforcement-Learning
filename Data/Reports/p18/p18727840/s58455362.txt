                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post right VATS has right chest tube and
 persistent air leak and respiratory failure.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph shows pneumothorax at the
 right lung base where a thoracic catheter is seen just above this, unchanged
 in position compared to a film from several hours earlier.  Increased haziness
 over the region suggests some fluid filling in this area. Surgical clips are
 seen at the right apex and despite the pneumothorax, there is volume loss on
 the right with mediastinal shift rightward.  Subcutaneous emphysema at the
 base of the neck persists, but axillary air on the left appears decreased. 
 The left lung is clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No increase in size of right basilar pneumothorax with stable
 chest tube positioning.  There may be some fluid filling in the pleural space.
