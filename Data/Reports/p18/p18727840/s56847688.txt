                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:47 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube, persistent pneumothorax and air leak.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is still a large right pneumothorax, increased since ___, stable
 since earlier on ___.  Right lower lobe collapse has progressed over the
 past several days and could be responsible for progressive hypoxia.  There is
 no leftward mediastinal shift to suggest hemodynamically significant tension
 pneumothorax.  Left lung is clear.  Severe subcutaneous emphysema has not
 improved in the chest wall or neck.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Orientation of the right pleural tube raises the possibility of fissural
 placement.  Findings were discussed by telephone with a member of the care
 team.
