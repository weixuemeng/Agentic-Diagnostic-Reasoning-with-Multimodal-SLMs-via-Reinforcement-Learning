                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated and reduces the
 sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax.  Right chest tube remains in place,
 with air-fluid levels at the right lung base in keeping with
 hydropneumothoraces.  Small left pleural effusion is present, but there is no
 definite left pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis has slightly improved, and post-operative changes at right lung
 apex at wedge resection site appear similar.
