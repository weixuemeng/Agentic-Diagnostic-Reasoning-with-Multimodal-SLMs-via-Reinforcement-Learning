 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe wedge resection, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right
 pneumothorax is decreased.  The dimension of the pneumothorax is
 approximatively 1.3 cm at the lung apex and shows a small basal component. 
 The right chest tube is in situ.  No evidence of tension is present.  Soft
 tissue air collection on the right.  On the left, there is minimal atelectasis
 at the left lung bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.  No
 larger pleural effusions.  No new focal parenchymal opacities.
