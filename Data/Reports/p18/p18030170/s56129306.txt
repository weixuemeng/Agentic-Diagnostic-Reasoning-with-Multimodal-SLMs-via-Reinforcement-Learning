                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left perihilar enlargement reflecting left hilar and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy appears somewhat more prominent even allowing for differences
 in technique.  There are a number of small-to-medium-sized pulmonary nodules,
 mostly projecting over the left upper lobe, as seen previously, probably
 increased.  In addition, however, projecting over the right mid lung, there is
 a potential nodule of substantial size which has no clear correlate on the
 prior PET-CT.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected increase in metastatic disease.  Correlation with
 planned CT is suggested.
