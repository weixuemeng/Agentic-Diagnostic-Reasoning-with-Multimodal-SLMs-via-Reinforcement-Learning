                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R colectomy and severe OSA, desating
 post-operatively (hx of recent PNA)  // r/o atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is of the abdominal
 surgery. The lung volumes have substantially decreased. There are bilateral
 parenchymal basal opacities with air bronchograms. The symmetry of the changes
 favors atelectasis over pneumonia. Nonetheless, short term radiographic
 followup should be performed to rule out pneumonia or aspiration. No larger
 pleural effusions. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
