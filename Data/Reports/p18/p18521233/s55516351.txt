                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 This study is slightly limited due to lordotic positioning and slight
 rotation.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta appears to be
 slightly unfolded.  Perihilar and bibasilar airspace opacities are noted,
 which likely reflect mild pulmonary edema, worse in the interval.  Probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
