 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior chest radiograph performed yesterday morning, there
 is no significant interval change.  There is opacification of the left lung
 base, which may be due to overlapping soft tissue.  However, underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude in the absence of a lateral view.  There
 is no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 in the aortic arch.  Limited evaluation of the right shoulder shows a
 sclerotic and flattened humeral head along with glenoid deformity.  These
 findings are better demonstrated on the dedicated shoulder film dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lung base opacity, which may be due to overlapping soft tissue but
 underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude without a lateral view.
 2.  Significant right glenohumeral joint deformity, better evaluated on
 dedicated radiograph ___.
