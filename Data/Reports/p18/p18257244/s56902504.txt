                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute alcoholic hepatitis with rising WBC,
 hypoxemia (possibly volume overload, ? PNA)  // please evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have decreased.  The
 patient has developed massive bilateral parenchymal opacities in the mid and
 lower lung zones.  Although the symmetry of the changes and the presence of a
 subtle interstitial component would be more consistent with pulmonary edema,
 the presence of pneumonia or massive for aspiration cannot be excluded.  Mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
