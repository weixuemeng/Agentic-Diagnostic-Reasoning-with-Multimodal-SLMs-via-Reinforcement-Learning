                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ethanol cirrhosis presenting with HRS, and
 needing multi stage dophoff placement // needing multi stage dophoff placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph obtained ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, a Dobhoff tube has
 advanced minimally into the distal stomach.  Small left pleural effusion and
 mild cardiomegaly are unchanged. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary
 edema. Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear without focal
 consolidations.  Margin of the left breast implant is calcified. Increased
 density over the right chest likely reflects right breast implant without a
 calcified margin.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Dobhoff tube terminates in the distal stomach.  Radiograph otherwise
 unchanged with persistent, small, left pleural effusion.
