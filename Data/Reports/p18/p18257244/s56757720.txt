                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, jaundice
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged but not
 substantially changed in the interval.  Slight widening of the superior
 mediastinum is felt to be due to low lung volumes.  Aortic knob remains
 distinct. Patient is status post bilateral mastectomies and breast implants.
 New hazy opacifications are seen within the left lung with sparing of the left
 apex and left costophrenic angle, as well as the right mid and lower lung
 fields.  It is unclear if these reflect true parenchymal abnormalities or the
 presence of the breast implants.  Pulmonary vasculature does not appear
 engorged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacities projecting within both lungs may be due to overlying breast
 implants and low lung volumes.  Repeat PA and lateral views of the chest when
 the patient is able to is recommended for further assessment of the lung
 parenchyma.
