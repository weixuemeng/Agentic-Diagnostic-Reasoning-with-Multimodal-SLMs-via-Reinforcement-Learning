                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with EtOH cirrhosis admitted with ___ in the
 setting of decompensation. Decreased air entry on L>R. Any acute
 intrapulmonary process?  // Decreased air entry on L>R. Any acute
 intrapulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  There is a combination of left pleural effusion and left lower
 lobe atelectasis resulting increased opacity at the left lung base in
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.  Superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.  This has increased when compared to the prior studies.  There is a
 persistent airspace opacity in the right mid lung There is a minimally
 displaced fracture through the left seventh rib laterally, this was likely
 present on the prior study.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity at the left lung base likely reflecting a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis although superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
 
 Unchanged airspace opacity in the right lower lung.
