                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 01:34.  Chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately
 4.5 cm from the carina.  The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with
 the tip out of fields of view.
 
 Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is moderate pulmonary
 edema, which is somewhat accentuated by the lower lung volumes, though likely
 worsened.  Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours appears wider, which may be due to
 technique.  The heart size remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval worsening of the moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Minimally widened mediastinum, likely accounted for by supine technique. 
 There is high clinical concern for dissection, could consider a CT.
 3.  Satisfactory position of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes.
