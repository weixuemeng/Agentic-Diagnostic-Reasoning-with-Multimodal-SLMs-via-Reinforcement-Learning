                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal linear opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  Blunting of the left posterior
 costophrenic angle on the lateral view likely reflects a trace pleural
 effusion.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable small left pleural effusion posteriorly.  Mild bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.
