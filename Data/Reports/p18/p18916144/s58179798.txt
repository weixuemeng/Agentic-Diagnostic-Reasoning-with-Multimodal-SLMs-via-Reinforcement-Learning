  NG tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating to the right of
  the spine likely in the distal antrum or post pyloric.  Otherwise, unchanged
  position of support devices.  Increased opacification of the right lung base
  from the most recent prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary edema,
 intubated with OG tube that potentially changes position.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach, potentially slightly more proximal
 than on the prior study but still with the sidehole being distal to the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.6 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line
 tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The left internal jugular line tip is at
 the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are stable.  Pulmonary edema appears to be progressed since the prior study
 associated with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
