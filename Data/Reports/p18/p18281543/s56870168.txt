                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with Fever, hypoxia  // assess for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings
 are noted suggesting vascular congestion.  On the frontal, there is mild
 retrocardiac opacity.  On the lateral view, there is increased opacity
 projecting over the posterior lung bases.  While some this could be due to
 overlying soft tissues though underlying parenchymal consolidation is also
 possible.  Right PICC tip seen over the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Presumably left basilar
 opacity could be in part due to atelectasis and overlying soft tissues,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
