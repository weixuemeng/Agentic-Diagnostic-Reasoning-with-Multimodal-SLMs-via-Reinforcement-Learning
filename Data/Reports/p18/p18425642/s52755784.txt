                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis with known liver nodules.  Evaluate for presence of
 lung nodules.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis from ___ at 2:06 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate tracheal
 deviation to the right, from a thyroid mass, better seen on the CT of the
 chest, abdomen and pelvis obtained roughly concurrently.  The lung parenchyma
 are clear with no obvious masses, which are better seen on the concurrently
 obtained chest CT.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are appreciated.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal with the exception of the aforementioned thyroid mass.  In the lateral
 view, there is a retrocardiac soft tissue density which corresponds to a focal
 area of liver parenchyma protruding through the caval hiatus. No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No obvious lung nodules. These are better seen on the concurrent CT of the
 Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.
 2.  Left mediastinal mass which corresponds to a thyroid lesion, causing
 tracheal deviation to the right.
