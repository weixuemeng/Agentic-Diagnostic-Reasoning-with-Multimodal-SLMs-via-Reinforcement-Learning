                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Peritoneal abdomen, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No definite evidence of free air is seen
 beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes, but clear lungs.
 2.  No definite evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
