                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Vomiting and hematemesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:   The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Streaky opacities in the
 right lower lung, probably referring mostly to the right middle lobe, suggest
 minor scarring.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
