 INDICATION:  ___ M with metastatic gastric cancer with dyspnea and orthopnea 
 // evaluate for pleural effusions      evaluate for pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is diffuse prominence of interstitial markings with the cardiac
 silhouette at the upper limits normal in size in bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Although some of the interstitial changes could relate to elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, in view of the clinical history the possibility of widespread
 lymphangitis metastases would have to be seriously considered.
 Left subclavian Port-A-Cath extends to the lower SVC.
