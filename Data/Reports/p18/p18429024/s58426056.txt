                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle collision with difficulties ventilating.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiographs from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  An orogastric tube coils once in
 the stomach, as before.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Each hilum shows ill defined perihilar opacity and focal opacity in the right
 lower lung persists.
 
 There is now a small right-sided pneumothorax with a measured distance between
 the outer pleural line and chest wall measuring up to 7 mm; otherwise, aside
 from increased lung volumes, there is no other change.  No definite fracture
 is appreciated. 
 
 IMPRESSION: New small right-sided pneumothorax.  Dr. ___ ___ the
 findings with the clinician caring for the patient at the time of discovery
 and communication at 1:55 p.m. by telephone.
