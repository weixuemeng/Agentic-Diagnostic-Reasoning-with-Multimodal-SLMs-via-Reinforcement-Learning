                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with seizures.  Evaluate for evidence of mass or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung demonstrates a band of opacity across the lower lung
 field that extends to the right heart border, without obscuring it.  The left
 lung is clear without focal opacities.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity likely represents aspiration/pneumonia
 in the clinical setting of seizures.
