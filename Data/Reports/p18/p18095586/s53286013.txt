                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, occasional cough and tachycardia,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The lungs are well expanded and show a subtle opacity
 in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: An opacity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe is most
 consistent with pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs after adequate treatment are
 recommended to document resolution.
