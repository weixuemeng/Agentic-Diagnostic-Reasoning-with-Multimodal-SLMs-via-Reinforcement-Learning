                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fevers, malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases is likely reflective of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect
 atelectasis however infection, including atypical pneumonia, cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
