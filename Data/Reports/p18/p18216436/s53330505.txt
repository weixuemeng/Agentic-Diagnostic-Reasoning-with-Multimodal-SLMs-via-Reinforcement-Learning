                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left-sided pain just proximal to costal
 margin.  Evaluate for rib fracture or acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the right with respect to the film.  Rotated position
 exaggerates mediastinal widening and a convexity along the aortic contour,
 which corresponds to the patient's known descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 again seen.  There is no focal pulmonary consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pleural effusion.  There is exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic spine.  The
 osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable, and there is no evidence of rib
 fracture.  No radiopaque foreign bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No rib fracture seen.
 2.  Rotated position exaggerates convexity of the known descending thoracic
 aortic aneurysm, preventing assessment for subtle interval change.
