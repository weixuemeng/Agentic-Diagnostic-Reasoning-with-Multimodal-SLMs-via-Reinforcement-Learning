                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is limited due to the patient's kyphotic positioning, rotation, and
 low lung volumes.  Additionally, soft tissues of the neck obscure evaluation
 of the lung apices.  Given these limitations, the heart size appears grossly
 unchanged, and mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Known aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta is
 not well assessed on the current views.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present, and there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration is not excluded.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam due to patient positioning.  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and probable bibasilar atelectasis though infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat radiographs when the patient
 is able to for better assessment.
