                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New diagnosis of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Opacity projecting adjacent to the right hilus and
 lower lobe demonstrate a combination of substantial mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy and potentially interval development of right lower lobe at
 least partial atelectasis due to an area of the bronchi.  The right
 paratracheal lymphadenopathy is seen as well.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax.  There is no interval development of pleural effusion.
