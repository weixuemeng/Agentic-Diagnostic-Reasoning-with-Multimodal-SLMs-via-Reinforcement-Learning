 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged and slightly globular however is not significantly
 changed in size from the prior examination.  Retrocardiac opacity is again
 demonstrated and not significantly changed, likely reflecting atelectasis and
 a small effusion.  Small rounded lucencies project over the lateral right lung
 and may represent small loculated air pockets, possibly in the pleural space. 
 No large pneumothorax.

 Status post pericardial drain removal.  Left basal opacity likely represents
 atelectasis and in effusion, not significantly increased from the prior
 examination.  Small rounded lucencies projected over the lateral left base may
 represent small loculated air pockets in the pleural space status post drain
 removal.  Attention on followup exam.
