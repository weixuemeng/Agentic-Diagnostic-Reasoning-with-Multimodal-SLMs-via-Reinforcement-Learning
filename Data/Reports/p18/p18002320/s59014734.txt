                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated. There is a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device in
 place. The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft
 surgery. There is again a stent in the bronchus intermedius and confluent
 opacification in the right lower lung, probably involving the right middle
 lobe. Elsewhere heterogeneous opacities have improved substantially. There is
 a small pleural effusion on the right; there is no definite persistent pleural
 effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement in multifocal opacities aside from persistent unchanged right
 lower lung opacity, probably in the right middle lobe. The latter opacity may
 be explained by pulmonary hemorrhage, and particularly based on prior findings
 and the dense lobulated apperance of opacities, concern is for hemorrhagic
 metastatic disease in the right middle lobe appear
