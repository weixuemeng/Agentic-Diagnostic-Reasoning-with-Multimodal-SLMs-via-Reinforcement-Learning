                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  This image was just presented for interpretation. There is a stent
 in the bronchus to the right middle lobe. Otherwise little change.

 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:33 AM
  Interval removal of a line in the bronchus intermedius and an enteric tube
  from the prior study. Interval placement of stent, which projects in the right
  bronchus intermedius. Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the chest.
  
  MAIN REPORT:
  INDICATION:  Hemoptysis status post stent placement for temporary tamponade of
  right middle lobe.
  
  COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
  
  TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
  
  FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube is been removed.
  An endobronchial tube has been removed and replaced by a stent across the
  bronchus intermedius. There is persistent opacification in the right lower
  lung, probably in the referring to the right middle lobe. Heterogeneous
  opacities in the left lung appear unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and
  hilar contours appear stable. Is probably a trace pleural effusion on each
  side, probably unchanged.
  
  IMPRESSION:  Status post removal of an endobronchial tube and stent placement
  and bronchus intermedius. Similar heterogeneous opacification of each lung
  most confluent in right middle lobe.
