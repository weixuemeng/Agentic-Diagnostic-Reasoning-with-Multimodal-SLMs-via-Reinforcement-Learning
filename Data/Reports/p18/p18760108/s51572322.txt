                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer with high fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the right upper lung zone, there is a 2.6 rounded opacity which
 corresponds to the known pulmonary mass.  Additionally, in the left mid lung
 zone, there is a 5-mm well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule, which correlates to
 the known pleural-based nodule.  No new discrete masses or nodules are
 identified.  There is no consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is stably tortuous and enlarged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable right upper lobe mass.
 3.  Stable left mid lung zone pleural-based nodule.
