                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dyspnea on exertion for five
 months.  FEV1 and FVC slightly lowered, evaluate for infiltrates as cause of
 dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple
 surgical clips in the anterior mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass
 surgery.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is present.  There is some upper zone
 redistribution pattern in the pulmonary circulation, but no signs of advanced
 interstitial or alveolar edema are seen.  Also, the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation.  No evidence of new
 discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  No pneumothorax can be
 identified in the apical area.  Moderate degree of degenerative change is
 noted in the thoracic spine which shows a mildly accentuated kyphotic
 curvature.
 
 Our records include a previous chest examination dated ___. 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement existed already at that time, but the patient had
 no signs of bypass surgery.  The patient was postoperative to hernia repair
 and had bilateral chest wall emphysema with suspicious mediastinal emphysema. 
 These signs have disappeared.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement, mild degree of pulmonary
 congestion, but absence of new acute infiltrates.  Evidence of previous bypass
 surgery.
