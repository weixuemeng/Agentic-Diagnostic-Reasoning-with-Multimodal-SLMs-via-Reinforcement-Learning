                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with focal L sided tenderness  // eval for fracture 
 eval for fracture
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there
 is no definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal
 pneumonia.  Specifically, no evidence of rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs raises the possibility of some underlying
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Apical pleural thickening suggests old tuberculous
 disease.
