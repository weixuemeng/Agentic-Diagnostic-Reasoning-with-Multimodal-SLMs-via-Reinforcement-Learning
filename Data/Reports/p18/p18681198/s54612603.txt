                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and pedal edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates
 atherosclerotic mural calcifications at the aortic arch.  The hilar contours
 are normal.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angle on the right is compatible with a trace pleural effusion. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is scarring within the lung apices.  No
 focal consolidation is identified, and there is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion. 
 Hyperinflation of the lungs suggestive of underlying COPD.
