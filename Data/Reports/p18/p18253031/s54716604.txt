                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, hypotension and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___ as well as prior chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  A mild compression deformity of L1
 appears unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  However, healed left
 posterolateral rib fractures involving the sixth and seventh ribs and possibly
 the eighth are unchanged.  A right anterolateral seventh rib fracture shows
 callus suggesting that it is also subacute or older.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings suggesting recent injury or acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
