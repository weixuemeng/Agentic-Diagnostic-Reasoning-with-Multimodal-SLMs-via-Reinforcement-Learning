                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:25 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with febrile neutropenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous pulmonary edema has resolved, though it is difficult to exclude
 minimal interstitial abnormality given the very low lung volumes.  These also
 exaggerate heart size which is probably mildly enlarged, and caliber of the
 mediastinal veins and pulmonary vasculature both improved since the previous
 study.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in
 standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
 effusion.
