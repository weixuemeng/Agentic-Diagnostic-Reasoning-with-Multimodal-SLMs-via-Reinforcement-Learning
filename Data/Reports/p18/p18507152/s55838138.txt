                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lung fields is limited due to poor patient
 positioning and low inspiratory lung volumes.  Within these limitations, there
 is mild opacification at the bilateral bases which may represent atelectasis
 in the setting of such low lung volumes; however, superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There is no pulmonary edema.  A right
 PICC is in place with the tip terminating in the low SVC.  A left pectoral
 pacemaker is unchanged in appearance with two leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but
 stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
 unchanged from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes.  Mild
 bibasilar opacification may represent atelectasis; however, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
