                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, HIV.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes with accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Subtle right basilar opacity most likely represents atelectasis although
 infection cannot exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
