                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is slightly limited due to patient's kyphotic positioning.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged, with the heart size likely
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view
 suggests the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with a compression
 deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly suggestive of small bilateral pleural effusions.
