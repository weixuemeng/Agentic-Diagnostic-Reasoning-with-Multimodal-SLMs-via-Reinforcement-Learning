                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Pulmonary vasculature is mildly
 prominent with enlarged pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The aorta is tortuous with rightward tracheal deviation at the
 level of the aortic arch.  
 
 Lower thoracic or upper lumbar vertebral compression deformity is seen, age
 indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Prominent pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 2.  Right tracheal deviation at the level of the aortic arch; aneurysm cannot
 be excluded.
 3.  Compression deformity of a lower thoracic or upper lumbar vertebral body,
 age indeterminate.  Correlation for pain at this level is recommended.
