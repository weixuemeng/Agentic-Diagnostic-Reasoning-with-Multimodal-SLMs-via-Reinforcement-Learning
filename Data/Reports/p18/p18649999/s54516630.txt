                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post VATS of left upper lobe and
 lower lobe wedge resections on ___.  Pathology returned with chronic
 inflammation with focal organizing pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Patient's inspiration has improved with significantly lower
 positioned diaphragms in deep inspiration.  The right-sided hemithorax is now
 unremarkable without any remaining basal linear atelectasis.  On the left
 base, a linear plate atelectasis remains terminating in a small parenchymal
 density close to the diaphragmatic contour.  Just lateral to this density, a
 local pleural thickening remains.  These changes show improvement and most
 likely represent scar formations after the previous surgical wedge resection
 intervention.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  No evidence of
 remaining free pleural effusion and no signs of pneumothorax in the apical
 area.
