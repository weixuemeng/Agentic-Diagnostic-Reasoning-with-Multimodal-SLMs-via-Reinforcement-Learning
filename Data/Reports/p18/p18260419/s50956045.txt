                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation, assess for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable semiupright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON: ___
 
 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube is positioned low within the trachea, only 8 mm
 above the carina and should be withdrawn at least 2 cm for optimal
 positioning. ET tube cuff also appears slightly overinflated.  Nasogastric
 tube courses into the stomach and out of view.  Low lung volumes are seen with
 bibasilar atelectasis and poorly assessed patchy left basal opacity.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates near the level of the carina, could be
 withdrawn by at least 2 cm for optimal positioning.  These findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ who informed that
 the patient was being extubated.
 2. ET tube cuff appears slightly over inflated.
 3. Patchy left basal opacity could reflect atelectasis, though attention on
 subsequent radiographs is recommended.
