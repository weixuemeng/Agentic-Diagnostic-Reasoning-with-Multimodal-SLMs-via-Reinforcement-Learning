                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post fall (___ feet) from truck
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes.
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present.  Minimal patchy opacity
 in the left upper lung field may reflect an area of contusion or aspiration. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.  Surgical anchors overlie the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacity in the left upper lung field is nonspecific,
 but may reflect an area of contusion or aspiration.
