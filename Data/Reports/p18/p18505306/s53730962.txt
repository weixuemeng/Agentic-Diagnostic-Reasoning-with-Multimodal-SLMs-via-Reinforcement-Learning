                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 Since the original interpretation, the referring physician has provided prior
 chest imaging, a torso CT ___ and a frontal conventional chest
 radiograph on ___.  The abnormalities questioned on the current
 study are seen only on the lateral projection, and therefore the prior frontal
 chest radiograph is not contributory.  What I questioned as a possible lung
 nodule projected over the lower thoracic spine is seen as a benign bone island
 in a lower thoracic vertebral body on the CT scan, 2:72.  What was questioned
 as a second 6 x 9 mm upper lung nodule projecting on the lateral view above
 the ascending thoracic aorta has no corresponding abnormality on the CT scan. 
 It could be calcification that has developed in one of several prevascular
 mediastinal lymph nodes or it could in fact be a lung nodule.  The ___ CT
 detected several other subcentimenter lung nodules and recommended short term
 followup; none of these is visible on the conventional study.  Nevertheless a
 CT scan would be definitive in determining whether there is a new upper lung
 nodule.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and rhonchi.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 well expanded without any consolidation.  However, on the lateral view, there
 is a rounded density projecting over the spine and a possible second rounded
 density in the upper lung zone.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  At least one pulmonary nodule.  Comparison with prior chest radiographs is
 ideal. However if not available,  CT chest is recommended to better evaluate
 these findings/ 
 
 2. No pneumonia. 
 
 Wet read was given to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 10:04 a.m. at the
 time of discovery.
