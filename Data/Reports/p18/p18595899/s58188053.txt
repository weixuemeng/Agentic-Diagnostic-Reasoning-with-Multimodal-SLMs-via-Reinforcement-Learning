 TECHNIQUE:  Plain film
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Size of the patient's left apical pneumothorax is unchanged very slightly
 slightly smaller compared to yesterday's study.  Taking into account
 differences in obliquity, there is no significant interval change in the
 appearance of the lungs or the heart and mediastinal contours.  No central
 pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  Healed posttraumatic changes at the
 proximal humerus and acromioclavicular joint appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is unchanged to slightly smaller
