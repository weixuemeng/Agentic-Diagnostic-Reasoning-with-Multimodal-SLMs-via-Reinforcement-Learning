 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is now a large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There may also be an additional
 small focus of opacity superior to the right pleural effusion in the right
 upper lung.  No pneumothorax is seen. The right aspect of the cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to assess due to the large right pleural effusion,,
 but grossly the cardiac silhouette appears top-normal to mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  Additional streaky opacity more superiorly in the
 right lung could represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Followup to resolution.
