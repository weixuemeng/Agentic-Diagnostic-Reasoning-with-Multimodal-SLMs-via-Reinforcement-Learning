                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough in patient with CLL, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased
 opacification in the right mid lung zone has essentially cleared with some
 residual scarring.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs persists consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  Multiple old healed rib fractures are seen on the
 left.
 
 There is an area of increased opacification at the right base with poor
 definition of the heart border.  Patchy area of opacification is seen
 overlying the heart border and in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view.
 This combination suggests the possibility of a right basilar pneumonia.
