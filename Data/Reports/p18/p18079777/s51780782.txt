 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:16 AM
  
  
  There has been interval placement of a left-sided pleural drain which
  terminates at the base of the left lung.  A small left pleural effusion is
  significantly decreased in size from earlier today.  Persistent bibasilar
  opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
  
  Endotracheal tube is 6.1 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube descends below
  the field of view.  No pneumothorax is identified.
