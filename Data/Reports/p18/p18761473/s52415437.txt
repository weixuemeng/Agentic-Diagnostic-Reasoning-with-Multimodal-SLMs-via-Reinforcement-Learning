                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:47 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new right central venous line.  Confirm
 placement.  Assess complications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs, in
 conjunction with torso CT ___:
 
 New right subclavian line ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax, mediastinal
 widening or pleural effusion.  Small nodules most readily visible in the left
 lung conform to the CT appearance generally, but there appears to be less
 peribronchial infiltration in the apical posterior segment of the left upper
 lobe.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Progression in pulmonary abnormality between ___ and ___ torso CTs
 and subsequent improvement could be due to remission in an usual manifestation
 of metastases, but is more typical in terms of morphology for an inflammatory
 condition, either atypical infection, or if the patient has received steroids,
 sarcoidosis.
