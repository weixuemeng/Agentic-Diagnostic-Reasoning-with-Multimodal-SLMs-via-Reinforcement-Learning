                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increased confusion over two weeks, elevated
 creatinine and calcium.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Exam was extremely limited secondary to portable technique,
 poor inspiratory effort, and patient's body habitus.  There is no definite
 large confluent consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is stable compared to prior
 given differences in positioning and technique.  Osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited portable exam as detailed above without
 definite acute cardiopulmonary process; however, if further characterization
 is desired, repeat two views are suggested.
