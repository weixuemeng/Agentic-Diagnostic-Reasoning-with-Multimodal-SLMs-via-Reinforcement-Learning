                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with end-stage renal disease, just
 started on hemodialysis, increasing crackles on examination and oxygen
 requirement.  Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single chest view was obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement as identified on this single portable
 chest view persists.  Widened thoracic aorta with deviation of tracheal
 contours to the right in superior mediastinum similar as before.  Presently,
 however, the pulmonary vascular pattern does not show any signs of marked
 congestion or pulmonary edema and the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  No
 pneumothorax identified in the apical area.  Moderately gas-distended colon is
 overlying the left lower chest area and a considerably sized fat pad that
 surrounds the apex of the heart contour.
 
 Pulmonary vascular pattern and lung fields are now similar to what was shown
 on a PA and lateral chest examination of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No residuals after the episode of ___ where chest
 examination showed basal infiltrates resembling pulmonary edema.
