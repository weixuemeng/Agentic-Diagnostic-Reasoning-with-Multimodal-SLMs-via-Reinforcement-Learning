                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___F with cough sob, evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs dating back to
 ___, MOST RECENTLY ONE ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  ALTHOUGH THERE is no focal lung consolidation, THE LATERAL VIEW
 SUGGESTS MILD PERIBRONCHIAL INFILTRATION IN ONE OF THE LOWER LOBES, IN BOTH
 THE SUPERIOR SEGMENT AND PROJECTING OVER THE POSTERIOR LEFT VENTRICLE. THIS
 DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF THE DIAGNOSABLE PNEUMONIA, BUT COULD BE ACUTE
 BRONCHITIS. Views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 MORE LIKELY BRONCHITIS THAN PNEUMONIA. FOLLOWUP ADVISED.
