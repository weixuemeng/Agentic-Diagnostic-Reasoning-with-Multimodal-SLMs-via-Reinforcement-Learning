                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG s/p L pigtail removal ___  // follow up
 effusions      follow up effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged.  The combination makes it difficult to exclude concurrent
 pneumonia.  To make that determination would probably require CT scanning.
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no visible pleural drainage
 device.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is midline.  Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  Right
 PIC line can be traced as far as the superior cavoatrial junction but is
 obscured beyond that point by the feeding tube and a dual channel right
 supraclavicular catheter which ends in the right atrium.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
