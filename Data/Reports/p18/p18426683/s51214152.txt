                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with a hx of CABG x 3 (___), prolonged ICU course with
 post-op complications s/p trach (___), CHF, moderate AS, AAA s/p repair in
 ___, and CKD presenting with confusion and hypoxia despite ventilator
 and found to have intermittant fevers, leukocytosis, and CXR c/w infection
 superimposed on worsening pulmonary edema and preexisting pleural effusions
 concern for pneumonia  // eval for interval change eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are essentially unchanged. Again there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications bilaterally that could well represent congestive failure.
 Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis is seen. However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia.
