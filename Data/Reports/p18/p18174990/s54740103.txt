                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sudden onset dyspnea, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral interstitial opacities with a basilar
 predominance and pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Near-complete opacification
 at the left lung base silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and left heart
 border compatible with focal consolidation.  A small left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated but likely remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent but stable with mild tortuosity of the aorta and
 calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar pneumonia.
 2.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
