                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 There are widespread bilateral interstitial opacities, with a lower lung
 predominance, as well as subtle Kerley B lines and bilateral perihilar
 peribronchial cuffing.  There is no focal consolidation.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  There is prominence of the azygos contour.  Aortic
 calcifications are seen.  Degenerative changes are seen at both glenohumeral
 joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Concomitant
 infection at either lung base cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
