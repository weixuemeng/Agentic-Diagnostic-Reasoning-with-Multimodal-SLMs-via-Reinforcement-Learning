                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, resolving dyspnea, followup of left lower
 lobe opacity.  Status post diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the evidence of reticular
 opacities, reflecting interstitial fluid overload, is decreasing.  The extent
 of the pleural effusions, notably on the right, is slightly increasing. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged basal areas of
 atelectasis.  Old right humeral fracture.
