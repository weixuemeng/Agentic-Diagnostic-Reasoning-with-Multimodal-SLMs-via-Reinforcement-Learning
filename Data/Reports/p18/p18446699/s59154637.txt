                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status with history HCC
 metastatic disease, HCV
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Lung
 volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No
 overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is re-
 demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is
 identified although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view as the patient could not cooperate with positioning instructions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis. Low lung volumes. Exclusion of the left costophrenic
 angle.
