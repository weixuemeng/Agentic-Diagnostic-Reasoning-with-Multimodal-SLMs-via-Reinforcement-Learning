 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, evaluation after intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged, with exception of the Dobbhoff catheter that has been
 slightly advanced.  The tip of the catheter is not visible on the current
 image.  The lung volumes have decreased.  There is increasing evidence of
 atelectatic changes at both lung bases.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  New
 blunting of the right and left costophrenic sinus could reflect small pleural
 effusions.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No overt pulmonary edema.
