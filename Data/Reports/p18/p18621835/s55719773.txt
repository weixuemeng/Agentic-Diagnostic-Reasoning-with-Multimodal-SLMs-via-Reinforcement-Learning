                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and malaise, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse hazy opacification of both lung fields is likely related to
 soft tissue attenuation or underpenetration on technique.  Retrocardiac
 opacification with streaky opacities in lower lobes on the lateral radiograph
 most likely reflects atelectasis in the setting as decreased lung volumes. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical context, a superimposed infection is not
 entirely excluded.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits allowing for decreased lung volumes.  The trachea is midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild retrocardiac opacification in the setting of low lung
 volumes most likely represents atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 context, superimposed infection is not entirely excluded.
