                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with right pneumothorax after RFA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right lower lobe lesion was treated recently with RFA.  Small residual
 pneumothorax is unchanged, measuring at most 11 mm.  A pigtail still projects
 in the lower anterior hemithorax.  Multiple calcified pleural plaques are due
 to previous asbestos exposure.  Sternotomy was done for CABG in this patient
 with moderate cardiomegaly and a pacemaker with a lead in the right ventricle.
 There is no pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Unchanged small right pneumothorax after RFA treatment of a right lower lobe
 lesion.
