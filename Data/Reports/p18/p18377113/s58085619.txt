                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change of a right pneumothorax in a
 patient with Pneumostat in place status post radiofrequency ablation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  There is a right-sided pigtail catheter located in the right
 hemithorax.  The previously described small right apical pneumothorax has
 completely resolved.  Multiple calcified pleural plaques are unchanged and
 related to prior asbestos exposure.  Opacity in the minor and right oblique
 fissures represents a small right pleural effusion.  Opacity and a fiducial
 seed in the right cardiophrenic angle likely represent a small amount of
 procedural hemorrhage.  There is no pulmonary edema or vascular congestion.  A
 left pectoral pacer has a single lead ending in the right ventricle.  Median
 sternotomy wires are aligned and intact.  Mild cardiomegaly and the
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  The small right pneumothorax has completely resolved.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
