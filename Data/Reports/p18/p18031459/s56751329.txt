                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe COPD exacerbation and c/f PNA  //
 interval change, r/o edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably, mildly enlarged.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary edema is overall stable since prior examination, but
 the other the signs of cardiac decompensation - pulmonary and mediastinal
 vascular engorgement- are improving.  More confluent opacity is seen in the
 bilateral infrahilar regions, right greater than left.  Though these may be
 related to the underlying pulmonary edema, infection is not excluded.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Despite persistent pulmonary edema, cardiac decompensation is improving. 
 Appearance of the lung bases is suspicious for pneumonia.
