                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure, question of infection. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes with
 resultant bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the cardiac silhouette.
 Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  The
 interstitium appears mildly prominent, but allowing for at the decreased
 volumes, this is likely unchanged compared to ___ and ___.
 There is mild bronchial wall thickening in the perihilar and basilar region.
 No focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, consistent with a small pleural effusion. The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bronchial wall thickening could be infectious or inflammatory such as
 secondary to aspiration. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is
 present.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
