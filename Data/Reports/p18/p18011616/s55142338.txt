                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increasing interstitial findings  // Assess
 interstitial findings on previous CXR      Assess interstitial findings on
 previous CXR
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study on ___, the prominence of interstitial
 markings is less pronounced, with no evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Mild
 hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests chronic pulmonary disease, but no acute
 focal pneumonia.
 There is a dense rounded opacification projected over the right side of what
 appears to be the T12 vertebral body.  An abdomen study could be obtained to
 better characterize this finding.
