  1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. No displaced rib fracture, however chest radiograph is not sensitive for
  the detection of subtle rib fracture.
  3. Widening of the right AC joint measuring 6 mm, age-indeterminate. 
  Correlate with pain at this location evaluate for acute AC joint disruption.
  Given well corticated osseous density inferior to the clavicle, this may be
  chronic.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob and pain with inspiration after being tackled while
 playing rugby, rule out fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes normal.  The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild
 widening of the right AC joint measure up to 6 mm, with superior displacement
 of the lateral aspect of the clavicle can be seen in the setting of AC joint
 disruption.  There is no evidence of a displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. No displaced rib fracture, however chest radiograph is not sensitive for
 the detection of subtle rib fracture.
 3. Widening of the right AC joint measuring 6 mm, age-indeterminate. 
 Correlate with pain at this location evaluate for acute AC joint disruption. 
 Given well corticated osseous density inferior to the clavicle, this may be
 chronic.
