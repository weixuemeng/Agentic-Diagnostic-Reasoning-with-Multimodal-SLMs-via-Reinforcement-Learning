                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  The patient status post fall with right flank pain.  Assess for
 rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Left lung base
 opacities are most likely atelectasis.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Heart is normal in size.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No
 displaced rib fracture is detected.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of a rib fracture.  In the setting of high clinical suspicion for
 a rib fracture, consider dedicated rib series for further assessment.
