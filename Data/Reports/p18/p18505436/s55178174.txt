                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of HIV with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are coarsened peribronchovascular interstitial markings. 
 Scattered ground-glass opacities are also noted, which appear ill defined.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarsened interstitial markings with ground-glass opacities are
 nonspecific, however, could indicate infection including atypical infection
 such as PCP.
