                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New ICD placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The biventricular pacer defibrillator has its leads in expected locations,
 although of note is that the right ventricular lead appears to be higher than
 on the prior imaging, although on the lateral view it follows the expected
 course within the right ventricle.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Lungs are clear.
