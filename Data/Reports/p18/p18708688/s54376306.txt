                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta remains
 markedly tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  New focal opacity is seen within
 the left lower lobe with blunting of the costophrenic recesses posteriorly on
 the lateral view suggestive of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Multiple
 loose bodies are noted within the right shoulder joint.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Numerous osseous metastatic
 lesions are better seen on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal opacity within the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia, with
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Known osseous metastatic lesions are
 better seen on the previous CT.
