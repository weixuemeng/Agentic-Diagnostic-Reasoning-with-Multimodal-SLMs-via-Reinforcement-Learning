                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Mediastinal
 and hilar lymphadenopathy are similar in appearance, and there remains near
 complete collapse of the left lower lobe adjacent to a small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion may be slightly decreased from
 the prior study.  Adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis is also slightly
 better.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for a questionable new opacity in the
 right lung apex medially, for which a followup radiograph with standard PA and
 lateral technique would be helpful for confirmation and further
 characterization.
