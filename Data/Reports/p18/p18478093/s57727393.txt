                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer and septicemia, now with possible previous
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the
 right base has decreased and the right heart border is now visible.  This most
 likely reflects glaring consolidation or possible area of volume loss.
 
 There are areas of atelectatic change at the bases, though no evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion at this time.
