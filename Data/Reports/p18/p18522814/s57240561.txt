                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The fact that
 the right cardiac border is mildly obscured suggests minimal opacification of
 the medial segment of the right middle lobe, not as well seen on the lateral
 view.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal opacification of the right middle lobe suspected, commonly due to
 atelectasis.  Comparison to prior radiographs may be helpful, if available.
