                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, assess pneumonia or other acute intrathoracic
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Extreme
 kyphotic angulation of the T-spine limits the evaluation of the chest. 
 Allowing for this, there is interstitial pulmonary edema noted without focal
 consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia or aspiration. Tiny
 effusions cannot be excluded. Heart size is increased which in part may
 reflect technique.  The aorta is unfolded which likely in part accounts for
 the marked widening of the mediastinal contour.  There is patient rotation to
 the right which somewhat limits the evaluation.  Bones are demineralized
 without definite signs of fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema, possible tiny pleural effusions.
