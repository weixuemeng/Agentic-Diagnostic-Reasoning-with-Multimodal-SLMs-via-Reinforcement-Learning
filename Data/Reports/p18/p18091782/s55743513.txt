                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with s/p cardiac arrest / eval for anoxic brain injury, ETT
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 3.9 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube with side port seen over the stomach.  Low lung volumes are
 noted.  This likely accentuates the hilar contours which are particularly
 enlarged, particularly on the left.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Orthopedic hardware seen
 involving the right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and enteric tubes in appropriate position.
 Increased opacity projecting over the hila, potentially due to bronchovascular
 crowding in the setting of low lung volumes however followup will be necessary
 when clinically feasible to exclude underlying abnormal hilar enlargement or
 mass lesion.
