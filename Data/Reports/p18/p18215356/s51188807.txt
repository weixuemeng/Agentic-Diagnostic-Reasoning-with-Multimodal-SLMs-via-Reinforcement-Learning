                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  History of CABG, coronary disease, and recent aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The aortic valve prosthesis is not well demonstrated.  There is a
 moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with parenchymal opacity,
 probably attributable to atelectasis, both increased since the prior
 examination.  The left lung remains clear.  There is a trace pleural effusion
 on the left side.  There is no definite persistence of right-sided
 pneumothorax.
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing pleural effusion and parenchymal opacity on the right,
 the latter not entirely specific, but probably attributable to coinciding
 atelectasis.
