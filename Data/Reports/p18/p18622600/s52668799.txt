                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, presenting with orthopnea and hypertension.
 Patient has suspected fluid overload and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, as before.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no overt
 evidence for fluid overload.  There may be perhaps a vague opacity in the
 right lower lung that appears similar and may represent minimal chronic
 scarring or atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Degenerative changes including fragmentation of the humeral head on the right
 appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
