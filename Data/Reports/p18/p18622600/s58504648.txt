                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures
 and limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient.  Although
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present, there are no areas of
 interstitial or alveolar opacities to suggest the presence of pulmonary edema.
 Subtle opacity in the right infrahilar region, partially obscuring the medial
 right hemidiaphragm, is new.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.  Calcifications are present along both hemidiaphragms and
 appear to be intra-abdominal rather than pleural on prior CT abdomen of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Focal opacity in right infrahilar region,
 which may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or an early focus of infection. 
 Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
