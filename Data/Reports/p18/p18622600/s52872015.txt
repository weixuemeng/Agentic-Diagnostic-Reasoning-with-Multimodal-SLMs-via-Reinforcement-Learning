                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confirm bacteremia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lumen dialysis catheter terminating in the
 uppermost part of the atrium, in an unchanged position.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear aside from patchy right infrahilar
 opacity that appears unchanged and may be associated with minor chronic
 scarring or atelectasis.  The appearance includes mildly dilated descending
 airways noting an element of slight bronchiectasis.  There are similar
 degenerative changes which are incompletely characterized along the right
 shoulder.  The bones appear sclerotic compatible with known renal
 osteodystrophy. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
