                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chf  // eval for pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the interstitial markings may be accentuated by portable
 technique although interstitial edema is also possible.  There is no confluent
 consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is likely
 accentuated by portable technique and appears slightly enlarged.  Old healed
 right posterior rib fractures are noted.  Deformities of the lateral left ribs
 suggest fractures which could also be old but are not well characterized.
