                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Metastatic lung cancer, presenting with right-sided pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and more recent radiographs from the same day
 from___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large right hilar mass with associated post-obstructive
 atelectasis, including volume loss with moderate elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is more discretely visualized with a marked reduction of pleural
 effusion, but opacification has substantially improved in the right lower
 lung, either due to rapidly clearing atelectasis or interval thoracentesis. 
 The left lung remains clear aside from streaky left basilar opacity suggesting
 minor atelectasis.  The lateral view demonstrates that a major mass-like
 opacity is predominantly posterior and perhaps centered primarily in the right
 lower lobe, although not completely characterized.  A vague nodular focus
 projects over the left upper hemithorax, in the same location as seen
 previously, but not as well visualized and potentially decreased.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The bony structures are unremarkable aside from
 mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial reduction in right lower lung opacification without
 evidence for pneumothorax.  Findings worriseomf for a large right perihilar
 mass with associated extensive atelectasis, concerning for underlying
 malignancy.
