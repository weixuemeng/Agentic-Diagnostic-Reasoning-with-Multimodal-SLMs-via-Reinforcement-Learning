                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with lung cancer, evaluate for progression.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lower lung is completely opacified.  There is
 interstitial thickening or atelectasis of the aerated right upper lobe.  A
 2.5cm lobulated opacity projects over the left scapula, fifth posterior rib
 and left lung apex.  There is left no effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar
 adenopathy is noted.  The left heart border is normal.  The right heart border
 is obscured.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Complete opacification of the right lower lung due to a
 combination of effusion and consolidation.  Interstitial thickening in the
 aerated right upper lobe could represent lymphangitic spread of known neoplasm
 or atelectasis.  A lesion projecting over the left chest could be a sclerotic
 scapular or pulmonary metastasis.
