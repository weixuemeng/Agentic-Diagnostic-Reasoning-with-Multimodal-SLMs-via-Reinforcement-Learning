                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic lung carcinoma and increasing
 white count.  Concern for obstructive pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Large right hilar mass is probably responsible for persistent collapse of the
 right middle and lower lobes, accompanied by an indeterminate volume of right
 pleural effusion.  There has been no change since ___.  No pneumonia in
 the left lung, but there appears to be a roughly 2 cm wide left lung nodule
 projecting over the third anterior rib.  Slight rightward mediastinal shift
 indicates that the abnormalitiesin the right hemithorax are longstanding and
 volume loss from atelectasis exceeds the displacement by pleural effusion.
