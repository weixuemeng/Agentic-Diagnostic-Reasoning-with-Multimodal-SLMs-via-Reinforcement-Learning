                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with HCC status post TACE with fever, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation is new consistent with pneumonia.  New opacities
 in the right lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is new.  This
 suggests that the opacity in the left lower lobe also has a component of
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.
 
 Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:00 a.m.
