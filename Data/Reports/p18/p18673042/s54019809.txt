                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of congestive heart failure. 
 Patient now presenting with acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 17:38 at outside hospital
 and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are increasing interstitial
 opacities with peripheral septal thickening, findings consistent with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  An opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine
 on the lateral view likely reflects a tortuous aorta.  No definite confluent
 opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is evident.  The
 calcified aortic arch is unchanged from prior.  Moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly, particularly right atrial enlargement, appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Calcified tortuous aorta, unchanged from prior.
