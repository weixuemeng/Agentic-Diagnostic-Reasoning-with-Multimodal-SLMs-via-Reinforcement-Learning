                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube tip initially
 was in the mid esophagus, though on later study it is within the stomach. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications bilaterally.  This could reflect pulmonary vascular congestion
 with a combination of bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis
 at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia or
 even ARDS would have to be considered.
 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed.  Left subclavian catheter remains in
 place.
