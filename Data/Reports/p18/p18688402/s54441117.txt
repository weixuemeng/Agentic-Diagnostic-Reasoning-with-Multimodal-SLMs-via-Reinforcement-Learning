                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Orthopnea, dyspnea, leg swelling, and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with particular left atrial enlargement is unchanged. 
 Both hila are larger today, I cannot tell whether it is all vascular or lymph
 node enlargement.  Lateral view shows a discrete elliptical opacity projecting
 over the ascending thoracic aorta, but this could be a superimposition of
 normal structures.  To exclude a focal lung lesion not seen on the standard
 frontal view, I would recommend obliques.  Otherwise, there is no focal
 pulmonary abnormality and no edema or pleural effusion.
