                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with shortness of breath
 and rhonchi as well as leg swelling and mild cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged since the prior study from ___. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion is present, right more than left.  There is
 upper zone re-distribution of the vasculature consistent with vascular
 engorgement, but there is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Left deviation of the trachea is re-demonstrated and might be consistent with
 vascular tortuosity in the area.
