                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR THE EXAM:  ___ years old woman with hypotension and hypoxemia. 
 Please evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable chest x-ray in supine position shows interval increase
 of left lung base opacification due to increased pleural effusion and 
 atelectasis.  Right lung base has improved with reduced pleural effusion. 
 Persistent mild vascular congestion.  Heart size is larger since prior CXR.
 Dedicated echocardiography is recommended to assess pericardial effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase of left pleural effusion and atelectasis with
 improved ventilation of the right lung base.  Increased cardiomegaly warrants
 further characterization by echocardiography.
