                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with heart failure exacerbation, status post
 diuresis.  Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent mild
 bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which has
 not significantly changed from the prior study.  The mediastinum remains
 enlarged with prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  There are
 stable-appearing moderate bibasilar pleural effusions.  There is
 stable-appearing severe cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent interstitial opacities consistent with ongoing
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, without significant change.  Additionally,
 there are persistent moderate-sized bibasilar pleural effusions, not
 significantly changed.
