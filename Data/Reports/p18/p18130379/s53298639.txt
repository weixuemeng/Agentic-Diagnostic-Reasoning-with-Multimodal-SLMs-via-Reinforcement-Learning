                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:42.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to large body habitus.  The heart is severely
 enlarged.  There are perihilar hazy opacities with vascular indistinctness
 compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Assessment of the lung
 bases is limited due to technique, but there may be atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities may reflect atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded.
