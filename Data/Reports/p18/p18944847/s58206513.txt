 status post pneumonectomy.  There is persistent consolidative airspace process
 in the right mid to lower lung which would be concerning for pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema is seen.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  No large
 right effusion is appreciated.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to the
 leftward cardiac and mediastinal shift related to the pneumonectomy.
