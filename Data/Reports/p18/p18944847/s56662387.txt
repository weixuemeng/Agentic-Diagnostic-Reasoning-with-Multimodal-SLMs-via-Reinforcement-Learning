                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with known pleural effusions presents with
 worsening hypoxia and shortness breath.  Question worsening effusion or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___ and chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax and leftward cardiomediastinal shift
 consistent with post-pneumonectomy change.  The right lung demonstrates
 increased consolidation in the lower lobe and possibly also the middle lobe
 suggestive of infection.  This distribution would be atypical for edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or large right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable post-pneumonectomy changes in the left lung.
 2.  Right lower lung consolidation, suggestive of new infection.
