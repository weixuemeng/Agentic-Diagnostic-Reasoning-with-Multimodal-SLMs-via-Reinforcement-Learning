                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post partial nephrectomy.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  The current radiograph is dated ___ and timed 7:05 a.m.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The patient has a NG tube coursing through the mediastinum with its tip
 terminating in the expected location of the stomach.  A fair amount of gastric
 air remains.  There is left basal atelectasis.  Aspiration pneumonia is not
 excluded.  Mild thickening of the major fissure on the right side is seen. 
 There is perhaps minimal pulmonary edema.
 
 Left-sided chest tube in situ.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Clips
 are projected over the left renal bed consistent with provided history of
 nephrectomy.  When compared to the prior study, little interval change is
 noted.  There is arguable some improvement in aeration in the left lower lobe.
