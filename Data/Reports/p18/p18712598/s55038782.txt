                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left chest tube.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen an endogastric tube coiling within the stomach. 
 Clips are also present in the epigastrium/left upper quadrant as well as a
 staple line along the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  A left-sided chest
 tube is present without a detectable apical pneumothorax, although a small to
 moderate pleural effusion on the left has grown with underlying atelectasis. 
 Additionally, an area of lucency along the left mediastinal contours is more
 prominent than on prior exam.  No mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic
 flattening is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Residual medial left pneumothorax with resolution of apical
 pneumothorax - no evidence of tension; slightly increased left pleural
 effusion with associated atelectasis.
