                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lethargy.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated with diffusely
 increased interstitial markings suggestive of chronic underlying lung disease.
 The cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous with
 atherosclerotic calcification of the arch.  There is apparent increased
 lucency projecting over the cardiomediastinal silhouette on the frontal
 without definite correlative findings on the lateral.  This could represent. 
 This could be artifactual in nature however may also represent a portion of
 the right lung projecting anterior to the cardiac silhouette, just behind the
 sternum on the lateral view.  In either case it is of doubtful clinical
 significance.  Wedge deformity seen of likely the L1 vertebral body, age
 indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggestive of underlying emphysema without definite superimposed
 consolidation.
 
 2.  Area of lucency projecting over the cardiac silhouette.  This may be
 artifactual or potentially due to portion of the right lung projecting over
 the heart, in either case of doubtful clinical significance.  If desired, a
 repeat films with obliques may help further characterize.
 
 3.  Age indeterminate likely L1 compression deformity
