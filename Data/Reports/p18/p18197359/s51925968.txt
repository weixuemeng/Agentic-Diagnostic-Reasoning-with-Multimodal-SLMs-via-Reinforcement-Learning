                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:11 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after CABG and chest tubes removed.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has largely cleared, but small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions have developed, presumably residual from cardiac
 decompensation.  The postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is minimally
 larger, but this could be a function of removing positive pressure ventilator
 support.  Right jugular sheath ends in the jugular vein.  No pneumothorax.
