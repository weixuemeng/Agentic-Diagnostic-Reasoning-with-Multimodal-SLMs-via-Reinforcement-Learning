                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AS s/p AVR, CHF, worsening dyspnea  //
 eval for effusions, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including minimal cardiomegaly.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate. Bibasal consolidations are
 unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema but mild upper is under distribution
 noted with the pulmonary edema seen on the prior study being resolved.
 
 The assessment of the right lower lung demonstrate more loculated opacities
 that before, but potentially might represent areas of atelectasis but collapse
 of the right middle lobe is suspected then correlation with chest CT to
 exclude the possibility of underlying abnormality is highly recommended.
