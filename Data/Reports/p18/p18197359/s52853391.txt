                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 left subclavian pacer lead that loops slightly as it appears to cross the
 tricuspid valve with the tip in the general region of the apex of the right
 ventricle.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively
 mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.
