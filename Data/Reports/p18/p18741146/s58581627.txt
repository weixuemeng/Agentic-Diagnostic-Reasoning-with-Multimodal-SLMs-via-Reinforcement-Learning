 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient 80 days after VATS surgery
 for left upper lobectomy with recurrent pneumothorax with chest tube removed
 at 4:30 p.m.

 ___ obtained at 09:25 a.m.
 
 Current study demonstrates minimal left apical pneumothorax, that appears to

 essentially clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal
 post-operative appearance with minimal left mediastinal shift.
