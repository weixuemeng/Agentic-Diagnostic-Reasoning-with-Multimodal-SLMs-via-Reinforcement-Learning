 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient still suffers
 from a pneumothorax.  The pneumothorax is approximately 1 cm wide at the left
 lung apex and shows a substantial air-fluid level in the retrosternal parts of
 the thorax.
 
 There is no evidence of tension, but atelectasis is seen at the left lung
 base.
 
 The right lung, apart from minimal fibrotic changes projecting over the right
 costophrenic sinus, is unremarkable.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
