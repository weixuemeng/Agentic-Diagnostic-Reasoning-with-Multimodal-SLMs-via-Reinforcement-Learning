 HISTORY:  New onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, status

 Tiny left apical pneumothorax is barely visible, continues to resolve.  Lung
 volumes have improved slightly, but there is still substantial atelectasis in
 the right lower lung.  Upper lungs are clear.  Small left pleural effusion
 collected anterior or posterior to the postoperative left lung is denoted by a
 straight horizontal interface.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall
 is decreasing.  Fullness in the left hilus and AP window of the mediastinum is
 stable postoperatively, not what one would expect were there any active
 bleeding. Heart size normal.
