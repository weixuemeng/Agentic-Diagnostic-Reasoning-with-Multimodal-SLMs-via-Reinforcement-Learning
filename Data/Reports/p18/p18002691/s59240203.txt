                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right cardiomediastinal contour has a pronounced convexity, and
 extends farther lateral than expected, particularly considering the normal
 appearance of the left cardiac contour.  There is an additional rightward
 convexity to the left of the spine.  It is uncertain whether this represents a
 markedly enlarged cardiac chamber or a paracardiac mass such as a hiatal
 hernia.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal centrally, but paucity of vessels in
 upper lobes suggests the possibility of emphysema.  With the exception of
 atelectasis adjacent to the right cardiac border, lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unusual configuration of right cardiomediastinal contour, which
 could be due to an enlarged cardiac chamber or paracardiac mass such as a
 large hiatal hernia.  
 
 In the absence of older radiographs for comparison, this could initially be
 further evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs when the
 patient's condition permits, as communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.
