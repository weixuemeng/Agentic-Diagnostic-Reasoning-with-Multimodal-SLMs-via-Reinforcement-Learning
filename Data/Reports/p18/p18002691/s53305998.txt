                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large retrocardiac mass is again visualized, extending to both
 sides of the midline, right greater than left, and measuring about 15 cm in
 greatest transverse dimension.  On the lateral view, this projects posterior
 to the heart, in a location that is typical for hiatal hernias, although no
 definite air-fluid level is visualized.  Cardiac size is difficult to assess
 in the setting of this large mass which partially obscures the right heart
 border.  Left cardiac contour and position are within normal limits.  Lungs
 are overexpanded, and note is made of attenuation of upper lobe vessels
 suggestive of emphysema.  Linear areas of scar or atelectasis are present in
 both lung bases.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  15 cm retrocardiac mass probably represents a hiatal hernia, but
 no definite air-fluid level is identified to confirm this diagnosis.  In the
 absence of a known history of hiatal or other paradiaphragmatic hernia,
 consider a CT scan or barium swallow for initial confirmation and to exclude
 other potential masses in this region.
 
 Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema.
