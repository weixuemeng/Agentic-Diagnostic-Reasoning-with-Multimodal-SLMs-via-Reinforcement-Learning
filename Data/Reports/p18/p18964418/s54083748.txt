                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with a TIA.  History of pulmonary nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to only prior chest imaging
 available, PA and lateral on ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and a probable partial rib resection,
 midlevel right hemithorax.  Left lung is clear and normal volume.  Volume is
 slightly diminished in the right hemithorax, presumably result of surgery.  A
 peanut-shaped opacity obliquely oriented crossing the right mid lung,
 approximately 7 cm long is most likely pleural reaction and bone regrowth
 following rib resection.  Oblique views would be helpful to confirm that and
 prior chest radiographs which undoubtedly exist somewhere should be obtained
 to see if there are new findings warranting more imaging with chest CT.
 
 Patient has had CABG.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable and there is no pulmonary edema.  There is either minimal right
 pleural scarring or small effusion.
