 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.

 seen. Linear opacity within the right lung base is compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Minimal patchy left basilar opacity is also likely
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 identified.  A surgical anchor projects over the right humeral head.
