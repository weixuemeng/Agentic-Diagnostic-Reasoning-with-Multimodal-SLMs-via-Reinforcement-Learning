                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 some increased opacification at the right base with blunting of the
 costophrenic angle.  Again, this could represent aspiration or developing
 pneumonia.  Otherwise, little change.  The stent graft and known aneurysm are
 unchanged.
