                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, shortness of breath,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Known large aneurysm of the descending aorta.  No chest films are
 available for comparison.  The exam is therefore compared to coronal
 reconstructions from previous CT examinations.  The ___ of the aortic
 aneurysm do not appear to have changed substantially.  The overall size of the
 cardiac silhouette is also unchanged.  Increased radiodensity in both lung
 bases is caused by CT demonstrated areas of combined atelectasis and mild
 fibrosis.  No pleural effusions.  No apical cap.  The aortic arch is
 unremarkable.
