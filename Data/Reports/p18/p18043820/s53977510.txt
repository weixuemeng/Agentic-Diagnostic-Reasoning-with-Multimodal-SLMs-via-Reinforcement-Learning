                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post transcatheter endovascular aortic repair, assess for
 interval changes.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endovascular stent extending from the distal
 aortic arch to the abdominal aorta is unchanged in position.  There is no
 evidence of stent migration or fracture.  A right internal jugular Cordis
 catheter and endotracheal tube have been removed.  
 
 There is new retrocardiac opacity, undoubtedly atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions have increased in size, now moderate and the heart is slightly
 larger.  Pulmonary edema is slowly improving, now mild.  No pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and small-to-moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, all worse than prior.
