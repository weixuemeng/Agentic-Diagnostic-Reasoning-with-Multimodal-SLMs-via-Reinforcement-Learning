  Near complete resolution of bilateral pleural effusions, status post placement

  interstitial pulmonary edema is overall not significantly changed, allowing
  for redistribution.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pigtail catheter placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of the bilateral pigtail
 catheters with interval decrease in bilateral effusions.  There are patchy
 areas of alveolar infiltrate in the mid lungs bilaterally with mild pulmonary
 vascular re-distribution and ill-defined vascularity compatible with fluid
 overload.  An underlying infectious infiltrate in these regions cannot be
 excluded.  The endovascular stent extending from the distal aortic arch to the
 abdominal aorta is unchanged in appearance.  There is no pneumothorax.
