                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:50 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a new PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 8:13 a.m.:
 
 Course of the left PICC line is not standard.  Although it ends over the head
 of the left clavicle, it has been withdrawn from more medial positioning, it
 is higher than expected and may be in a small vein rather than a central one. 
 Determining precise localization would require either fluoroscopic venogram or
 CT scanning if it is not possible to confirm its location clinically.
 
 Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces.
