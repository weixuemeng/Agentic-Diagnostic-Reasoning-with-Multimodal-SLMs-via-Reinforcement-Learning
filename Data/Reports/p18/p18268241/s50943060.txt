                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  SAH with increased secretions.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Aside from faint opacities in the left
 lower lobe, the lungs are grossly clear.  The aeration of the lungs has
 markedly improved from prior study.  These remaining opacities could be due to
 improved infection.  Minimal atelectasis in the right lower lobe is still
 present.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusions.  Tracheostomy tube is
 in standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
