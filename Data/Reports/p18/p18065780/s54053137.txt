                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, epigastric pain, cough, fevers. 
 Please evaluate for a widened mediastinum or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.  Apparent
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and widening of the mediastinum is
 likely related to the portable technique and the patient's rotated position. 
 Redemonstrated are linear areas of scarring, most prominent at the base of the
 right lung.  There is no focal consolidation.  The lungs are symmetrically
 expanded bilaterally.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively
 unchanged and may reflect a small chronic right pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening in this region.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for differences in technique and position, there is no
 significant change compared to the prior study.
