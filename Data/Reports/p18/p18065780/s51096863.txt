                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle,
 possibly due to chronic right pleural effusion and/or scarring.  Areas of
 linear scarring/atelectasis are seen scattered over the right lung.  No
 definite new focal consolidation is seen.  The left hilar contour appears
 minimally more prominent as compared to the prior study, which may in part
 relate to technique.  However, given history of lymphoma, this could be
 further evaluated on non-urgent chest CT.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta
 is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a
 small chronic pleural effusion/pleural thickening.  No definite focal
 consolidation seen.  Slight increase in prominence of the right hilum is
 nonspecific but in a patient with history of lymphoma, underlying
 lymphadenopathy is not excluded and could be further assessed on non-urgent
 chest CT.
