                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Opacifcation at the
 left base again is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural fluid.
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.  
 
 Of incidental note is opacification adjacent to the greater tuberosities
 bilaterally, consistent with calcific tendinosis in the rotator cuffs.
