 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A single lead left pacer is again identified with the lead intact and
 terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable. Lungs appear well inflated without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural
 thickening or a tiny effusion. Degenerative changes in the spine with
 unchanged fusion of two of the mid thoracic vertebrae which is likely
 congenital.
