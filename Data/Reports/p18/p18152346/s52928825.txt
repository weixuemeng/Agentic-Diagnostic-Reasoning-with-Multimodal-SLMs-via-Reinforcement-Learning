                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o CHF, increasing ___ requirement  //
 Please assess for pulmonary edema/effusions/atelectasis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is chronic, exaggerated by low lung volumes, which also make
 the pulmonary vasculature local more engorged, but I do not think there is ANY
 good evidence for congestive heart failure. Certainty there is no pulmonary
 edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
 Left subclavian pacer defibrillator lead follows the expected course TO THE
 FLOOR OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE.
