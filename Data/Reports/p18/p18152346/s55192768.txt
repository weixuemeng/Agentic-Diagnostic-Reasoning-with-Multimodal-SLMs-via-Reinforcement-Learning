                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post ICD.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of a single-lead left-sided ICD with lead extending to
 the expected position of the right ventricle.  There are slightly low lung
 volumes and minimal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  While
 there may be minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement, there is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains top normal to mildly
 enlarged.
