 HISTORY:  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, an ET tube is present,
 tip in satisfactory position approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.  There is
 probable cardiomegaly, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  There is
 patchy opacity at the left base, consistent with left lower lobe atelectasis
 and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
