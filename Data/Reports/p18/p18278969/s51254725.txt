                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lethargy, HIV
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  Heart size is accentuated as result with
 mild to moderate enlargement, similar to that seen previously.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes, and do not appear substantially changed in the interval.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
