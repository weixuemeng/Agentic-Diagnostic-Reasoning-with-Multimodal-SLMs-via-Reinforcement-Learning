                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dry cough for months.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated that might potentially be consistent with chronic airway
 inflammation.  There are no focal opacities in the lungs seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  If clinically warranted, correlation with
 high-resolution CT of the chest might be obtained.
