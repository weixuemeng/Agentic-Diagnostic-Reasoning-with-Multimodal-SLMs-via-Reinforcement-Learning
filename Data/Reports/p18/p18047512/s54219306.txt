                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with bacteremia, possible RML opacity on CXR last
 week  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is significant
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Medial right base opacity on the frontal view, not well seen on the
 lateral view may represent right hilar vessels underneath the elevated right
 hemidiaphragm with possible atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not entirely excluded
 given the clinical scenario, however it is felt less likely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, new since ___, but
 otherwise of uncertain age.  Medial right base opacity best seen on the
 frontal view may represent combination of right hilar vessels underneath the
 elevated right hemidiaphragm with atelectasis.  However, given the clinical
 scenario reported history, pneumonia is not entirely excluded, however it is
 felt less likely.  The recent prior chest radiograph is not currently
 available for comparison.
