                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hallucinations and tachycardia.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Mildly prominent upper mediastinal
 contours appear stable, however, since prior examinations.  There is a nodular
 density projecting over the left lower lung of approximately 10 mm in
 diameter, suspected to represent a nipple shadow, but a pulmonary nodule
 cannot be excluded.  Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along
 the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung, suggesting a nipple
 shadow, although a pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Evaluation with a PA
 view with nipple markers is recommended with clinically appropriate.  
 
 2.  No evidence of acute disease.
