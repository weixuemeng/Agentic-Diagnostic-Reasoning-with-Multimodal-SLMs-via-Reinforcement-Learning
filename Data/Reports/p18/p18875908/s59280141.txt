                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with polymyositis with prior edema no shortness
 of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lung volumes are low was secondary to
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  This may also account for the
 increased interstitial markings although a component of mild edema would also
 be possible.  There is no large pleural effusion.   Cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged, also likely accentuated by low inspiratory effort.  Dense
 atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch and there is tortuosity
 of the descending thoracic aorta.  Left chest wall single lead pacing device
 seen with lead tip in the right ventricular apex.  Severe compression
 deformity of the mid thoracic spine is seen, age indeterminate.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Low lung volumes accentuating interstitial markings though
 superimposed mild edema is also possible.  Severe lower thoracic compression
 deformity, age indeterminate and clinical correlation is suggested.
