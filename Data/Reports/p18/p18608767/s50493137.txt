                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with abnormal chest findings, evaluate
 further.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size, thoracic aorta and mediastinal
 structures are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No new
 acute infiltrates identified.  Comparison with the preceding study again
 demonstrates again the previously identified hazy density in the mid lung
 field on the right side, projecting over the posterior portion of the
 right-sided eighth rib on the frontal view.  This density is difficult to
 identify on the lateral view conclusively.  No other new abnormalities can be
 identified on the PA and lateral chest examination.
 
 Review is extended to the next preceding chest examination of ___ and
 it is noted that no suspicious density could be identified at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The subtle right-sided density has not undergone any significant
 interval change since the next preceding study of ___. 
 Considering patient's age and history, evaluation with CT is recommended.
