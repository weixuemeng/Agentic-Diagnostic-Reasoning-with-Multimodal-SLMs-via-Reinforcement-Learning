 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  Questionable nodular
 opacity at the lower mid portion of the right lung is demonstrated, projecting
 over the posterior aspect of the eighth rib, and might reflect developing
 infection or resolving infectious process.  The rest of the lungs are clear. 
 Hyperinflation is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 If the patient has infectious symptoms, reevaluation after antibiotic (in four
 weeks) is recommended.  Otherwise, assessment with chest CT is recommended.
