 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p RUL lobectomy with increasing L sided
 secrestions  // assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is again diffuse opacification

 edema or hemorrhage, multifocal pneumonia must be seriously considered.
 
 
 
 Otherwise continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with pleural changes
 consistent with recent upper lobe resection.
