 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with longstanding smoking history with new cough. 
 Evaluate for emphysematous changes and nodules.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates mildly hyperinflated lungs
 with minimal flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is a new nodular density of 2-3 cm
 within the right mid lung adjacent to the right hulim not seen previously on
 exam dated ___ and concerning for a substantial lung nodule.  There
 are additional heterogeneous interstitial abnormalities bilaterally suggesting
 an interstitial process. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suspicious new nodular focus in the right lung, possible malignancy. 
 Evaluation with chest CT is recommended.  Chest CT would also be useful to
 evaluate an interstitial abnormality.
 
 These findings were communicated to the ordering physician through the online
