                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Weight loss and hyponatremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest show multiple bilateral
 rounded opacities scattered throughout both lung fields.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral opacities throughout both lungs are highly
 concerning for septic emboli and less likely malignancy or inflammatory
 etiologies such as Wegener's granulomatosis.
