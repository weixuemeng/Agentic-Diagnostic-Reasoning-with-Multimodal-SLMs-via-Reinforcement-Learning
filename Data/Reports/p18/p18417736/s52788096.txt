                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, CKD, presenting with SOB  // please
 assess for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 1 day prior, moderate
 pulmonary edema has resolved.  Increased bibasilar opacities are combination
 of increased bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are well aligned and
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement of pulmonary edema with development of bilateral
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are consistent with a natural course of
 resolving edema.
