                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with swan in place  // ___/hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated with persistent pulmonary edema.
 There is interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm likely represent
 atelectasis.
 
 The pulmonary artery catheter is again visualized and terminates slightly
 distally within the right pulmonary artery compared to the prior radiograph. 
 However this appearance may be related to the technique.
 Dual lead AICD projects over the left upper thorax with intact pacer wires.
 Right sided central line terminates in the SVC.
 Numerous EKG leads overlie the chest wall.
 Sternotomy sutures and a mechanical cardiac valve remain unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions with unchanged left
 retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis.
 2. Lines and tubes as above.
