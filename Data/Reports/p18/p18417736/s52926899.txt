 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left pectoral pacemaker device is unchanged in position.  Replaced
 aortic valve is unchanged in position.  Median sternotomy wires are unchanged.
 
 Bilateral interstitial opacities are new from ___, favored to be
 edema and given the short interval time course of development.  However
 concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical situation.
 The heart remains enlarged.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are mild.  Slight blunting of right costophrenic angle could be
 a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes in the
