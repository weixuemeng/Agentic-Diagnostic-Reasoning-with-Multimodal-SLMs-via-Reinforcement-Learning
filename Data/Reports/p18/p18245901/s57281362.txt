                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric pain, worse with exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 Mediastinal hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Linear and patchy opacities the lung bases most likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities, potentially atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration are not excluded.
