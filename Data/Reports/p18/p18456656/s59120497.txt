                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female intubated status post transfer.  Evaluate for
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular
 structures.  The heart is normal in size given the low lung volumes.  There is
 a right internal jugular central venous line which terminates in the proximal
 right atrium.  An enteric tube terminates below the view of this radiograph. 
 There is an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 1.9 cm above the
 level the carina.  Gaseous distention of bowel loops is noted in the upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.9 cm
 above the level the carina, and pullback by 1 cm is recommended.
 2.  Gaseous distention of stomach and bowel loops in the upper abdomen.
