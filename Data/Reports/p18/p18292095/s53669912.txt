 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Due to
 patient's altered mental status, unable to cooperate for lateral view The
 patient is rotated to the left on the frontal view.  A left-sided PICC is
 again seen.  Distal aspect not well appreciated, but likely terminating in the
 proximal to mid SVC.  There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, which may be due to a trace effusion.  No discrete focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Degenerative changes are noted at the right shoulder
 and acromioclavicular joints.
