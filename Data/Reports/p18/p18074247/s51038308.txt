                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Nerve stimulator device projects over the left mid hemithorax with a single
 lead coursing cephalad into the neck.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity
 may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Remote
 right mid clavicular fracture is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
