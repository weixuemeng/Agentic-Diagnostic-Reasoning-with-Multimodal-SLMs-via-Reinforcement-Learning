                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hyperglycemia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, sugesting COPD.  The heart is
 not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Bibasilar atelectasis. There is no CHF
 or focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite infiltrate. If there is high
 suspicion for a pneumonic infiltrate, then a lateral view could help for
 further assessment.
