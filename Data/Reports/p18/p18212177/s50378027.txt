                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema and effusions after thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there has been a
 thoracentesis on the right with some decrease in the degree of pleural fluid,
 though a substantial amount appears to remain.  No convincing evidence of a
 substantial pneumothorax on this technically limited study.
