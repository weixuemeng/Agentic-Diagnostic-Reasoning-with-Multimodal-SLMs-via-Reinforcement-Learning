                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with right pleural effusion, thoracocentesis, pigtail.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso of ___, chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Pigtail that was proven to be outside of the patient's pleural space has been
 removed since previous exam.  Pleural effusion has reaccumulated but the
 amount is minimal.  New bilateral bibasilar opacities could represent
 atelectasis, however an aspiration or developing pneumonia cannot be excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 and cardiac contours are normal.  Left-sided PICC line ends at cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Small right-sided pleural effusion has slightly increased in volume after
 pigtail removal.
 2.  New bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis.  However,
 aspiration or pneumonia may have a similar radiographic appearance.
