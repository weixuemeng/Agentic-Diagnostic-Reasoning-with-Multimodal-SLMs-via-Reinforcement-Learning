                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral PEs, intubated, now with OG tube
 placement  // OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 06:47am.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the last chest radiograph performed several hours ago on the
 same date, there has been interval placement of an OG tube. It is seen
 extending distally to at least the mid/lower stomach, where it crosses the
 inferior margin of the image.  The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position.
 A tubular structure with a distal coil is seen in the right side of the neck.
 There is a wedge-shaped opacity in the right upper lobe, which is new since
 today's CXR but was noted on today's CT scan.  It likely represents pulmonary
 infarction in the setting of known pulmonary embolism, but cannot exclude
 superimposed aspiration.  There are no large pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. OG tube terminates in at least the mid/lower stomach.
 2.  Wedge-shaped opacity in the right upper lobe, likely infarction from
 pulmonary embolism.  However, cannot rule out aspiration in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
