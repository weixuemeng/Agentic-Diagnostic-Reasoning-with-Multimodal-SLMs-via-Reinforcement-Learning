                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sepsis, now intubated.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital torso CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip 2 cm above the carina, the endogastric
 tube courses inferiorly with its side port well below the GE junction.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate dense
 calcified atherosclerotic disease throughout the ascending aorta coursing into
 the intra-abdominal portion.  Moderate left and large right pleural effusions
 are present with associated atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with associated
 atelectasis; endogastric tube in appropriate position and ET tube tip 2 cm
 above the carina projection about 2 cm may be considered for optimal
 positioning.
