                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  A pigtail
 catheter projecting over the right upper quadrant is also unchanged.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is
 mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with streaky
 opacification seen along the apex of the diaphragm and posteriorly, most
 suggestive of atelectasis, which has somewhat increased since a CT from ___ and radiographs from ___.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right basilar opacification and volume loss.  Although
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude, the findings are fairly typical for
 atelectasis, although increased.  Clinical correlation is suggested regarding
 the significance of increasing right-sided opacification in the right lower
 lobe; follow-up radiographs could be considered if needed clinically.
