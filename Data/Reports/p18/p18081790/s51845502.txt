                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp s/p CVL  // CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 00:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter ending in the right atrium.  The ET tube and NG tube are in unchanged
 satisfactory position.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Lung volumes remain low with unchanged extensive left lung opacity, which
 obscures the cardiac silhouette.  The presence of air bronchograms suggest
 left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A small left effusion would be
 difficult to exclude.  Again seen is some patchy opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic region, though the right lung remains otherwise grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  Note is made that the right IJ line overlies
 the right atrium, rather than the SVC itself.  No pneumothorax detected.
