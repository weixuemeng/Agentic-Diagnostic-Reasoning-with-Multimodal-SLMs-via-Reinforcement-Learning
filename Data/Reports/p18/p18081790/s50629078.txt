                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cerebral palsy, admitted for
 nephrolithotripsy, now with fevers, chills, recent rehab stay, r/o PNA  //
 evidence of PNA     evidence of PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there has been substantial
 opacification in the mid and lower left lung with apparent air bronchograms,
 though the hemidiaphragm appears sharp.  There also is marked prominence in
 the hilar regions bilaterally without evidence of indistinct vessels
 peripherally.
 The radiographic appearance is somewhat unusual.  This could reflect a
 substantial pneumonia in a patient with sepsis, though in speaking with the
 referring clinician the symptoms are not suggestive of severe pneumonia. 
 Nevertheless, the antibiotic for urosepsis would presumably be effective
 against organisms crossing this consolidation.  There could be a substantial
 effusion, though the sharpness of the hemidiaphragm would be unusual.  The
 hilar changes could represent substantial central edema related to over
 hydration, though the lack of peripheral edema would be unusual.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___
