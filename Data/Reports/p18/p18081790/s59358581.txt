                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, tachycardia, known stones, PCN and
 urosotomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette size is accentuated as result
 appearing mild to moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Clips in the right upper quadrant indicate
 prior cholecystectomy.  A percutaneous catheter projects over the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
