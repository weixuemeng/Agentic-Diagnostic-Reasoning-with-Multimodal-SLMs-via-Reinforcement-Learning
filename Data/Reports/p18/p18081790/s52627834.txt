                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  A right IJ central line is present, similar to the film from 1:59
 a.m..  It overlies the right atrium.  The could be retracted by approximately
 3 cm to lie in the distal SVC, with note made that the inspiratory volumes are
 low and over-retraction should therefore be avoided.  This finding was
 discussed with the covering house officer by Dr ___ by phone at 12:02
 p.m. on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with urosepsis with respiratory failure with
 c/f ARDs  // Please assess for PNA, ARDs, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 01:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, no significant interval change is
 identified.
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, with tip at the upper edge of the clavicular heads,
 and an NG tube and side-port beneath the diaphragm overlying the upper
 stomach.  The ET tube tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.
 
 Also again seen is diffuse opacity throughout the left lung, with relative
 sparing of the upper lobe, which obscures the cardiac border.  There are some
 air bronchograms in the mid/lower left lung.  There is partial obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  On the right, inspiratory volumes are low with
 vascular crowding, but no frank consolidation or effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change compared with the film obtained earlier the
 same day.  Extensive opacification of the left lung is compatible with
 collapse and/or consolidation and a pneumonic infiltrate in this area cannot
 be excluded.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes and vascular crowding limits direct assessment of CHF.
 The degree of vascular plethora seen in the right lung could be accounted for
 by low inspiratory volumes.
