                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal distention.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is substantial dilatation of gas-filled loops of what appears
 to be primarily small bowel.  Relatively small amounts of gas are seen in the
 colon.  This is somewhat worrisome for partial small-bowel obstruction.  If
 this is a serious clinical concern, CT should be obtained.
 
 Atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.
