                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of renal transplantation and atrial fibrillation, status
 post left atrial appendage ligation, now with fevers to 102 degrees and
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pleural effusion, infiltrate, or other
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the upper
 SVC.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC.  Left lower lung
 consolidation may be minimally increased, possibly atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be excluded.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema,
 increased.  Marked cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.  A small left
 pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The ligation material projecting over the area of the left
 atrial appendage is unchanged.  Surgical clips are noted in the left upper
 abdominal quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lower lung consolidative opacification, possibly atelectasis,
 although infection is not excluded, minimally increased compared to the prior
 study from ___.
 
 2.  Increased mild interstitial pulmonary edema with unchanged marked
 cardiomegaly.
