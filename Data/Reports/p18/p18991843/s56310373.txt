 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip unchanged in
 position.  Surgical clips are again seen in the left upper quadrant.  There
 are increasing bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and
 interval appearance of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours cannot be assessed given the pleural effusions obscuring
 the heart borders.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
