                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup effusion and right lower lobe opacities.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Allowing the difference in positioning of the
 patient, moderate right effusion with adjacent consolidation is grossly
 unchanged.  The adjacent consolidation could be atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
 Small left effusion is unchanged.  Left port-a cath tip is in the cavoatrial
 junction.
