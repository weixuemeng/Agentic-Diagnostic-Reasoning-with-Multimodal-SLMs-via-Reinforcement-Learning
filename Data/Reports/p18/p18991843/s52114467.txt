 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation, evaluation for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists.  Minimal right and moderate left pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.  Atelectasis in the
 retrocardiac lung region are unchanged.
