                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia or fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is markedly
 enlarged but unchanged.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, which
 have increased in size from prior.  Opacities at the bases are presumably
 overlying atelectasis, although, pneumonia should be considered in the correct
 clinical setting.  There is prominence of the central vasculature and mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  An azygos
 fissure is incidentally noted.
