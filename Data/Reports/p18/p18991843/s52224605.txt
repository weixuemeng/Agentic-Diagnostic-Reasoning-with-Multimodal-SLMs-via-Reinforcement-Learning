 Left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Heart remains

 also be considered.  There are small layering effusions. Perihilar fullness
 and patchy bibasilar opacities are now present and likely reflect mild
 pulmonary edema with compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes. Incidental
 note is made of an azygos lobe. No pneumothorax.
