                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased O2 requirement, evaluate line placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, a left IJ central line is present --
 the tip tip lies at or immediately above the confluence with the left
 subclavian vein.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Compared with ___ at 13:27 p.m., the NG tube has been removed.  Allowing
 for differences in positioning, marked cardiomegaly and prominence of
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and diffuse increased interstitial and alveolar opacities, consistent with
 CHF.  There are probable small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  The CHF findings have progressed considerably compared
 with ___.  Possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude.  Multiple clips noted in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left IJ central line immediately proximal to confluence with the left
 subclavian, unchanged.
 
 2.  Marked cardiomegaly and mediastinal enlargement, probably unchanged,
 allowing for differences in positioning.
 
 3.  CHF findings, bilateral effusions, and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation has progressed considerably compared with ___.  The
 possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
