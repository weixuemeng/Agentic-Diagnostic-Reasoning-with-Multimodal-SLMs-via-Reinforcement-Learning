                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of AFib and generalized weakness
 with fatigue and hypotension.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Left chest wall port again seen
 with catheter tip at the RA/SVC junction.  Lower lung volumes on the current
 exam.  There is new right basilar opacity which is likely in part due to an
 effusion, although underlying infection is also possible.  Left base opacity
 on prior has somewhat improved with some opacity in the retrocardiac region
 medially and probable small left effusion.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear of
 consolidation.  Enlarged hila, particularly on the right is better seen on the
 prior exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not definitively changed. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.  Surgical clips
 identified in the left upper quadrant.  Incidental note is made of an azygos
 lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar opacity likely in part due to a moderate
 effusion with underlying atelectasis, although infection is also possible. 
 Persistent left basilar opacity likely in part due to an effusion and
 atelectasis as well.
