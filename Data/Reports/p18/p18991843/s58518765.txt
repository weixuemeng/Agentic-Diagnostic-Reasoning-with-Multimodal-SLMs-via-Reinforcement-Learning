 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post antibiotic therapy, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of both the left and the right pleural effusion.  Subsequent areas of
 atelectasis are unchanged.  No new parenchymal opacity that would suggest
 pneumonia.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged course and position of
 the left pectoral Port-A-Cath.
