 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:13 PM
  Moderate left pleural effusion is increased in size compared to the most
  recent radiograph from ___, although comparison is somewhat
  limited due to differences in patient positioning.  Left lower lobe dense
  compressive atelectasis is slightly increased.  Heterogeneous right lower lung
  opacities are increased, possibly atelectasis versus infection.  A small right
  pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax.  Improved mild interstitial
  pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pleural fluid leaking out of chest incision on the left.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, moderate left effusion
 has increased, as does small right effusion with adjacent bilateral
 atelectases, left greater than right.  Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally
 improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Left
 Port-A-Cath tip is in the lower SVC.  Multiple surgical clips project in the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
