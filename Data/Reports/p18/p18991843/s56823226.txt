                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant, now with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has
 been removed.  Port-A-Cath again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
 
 There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, which are not as well seen
 on the frontal view since it is an upright projection.  Atelectatic changes
 are present at the bases.  Some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again
 seen.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels probably represents some elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.
