 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest wall port catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC and is
 unchanged in position. Lung volumes are slightly lower than the prior exam.
 There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, likely due to small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis is present however infection in the
 right lower lobe is also possible.  An azygous fissure is noted on the right.
 There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged. Clips are noted in the imaged upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions. Right lower lobe opacity may represent
 atelectasis however infection is also possible.
