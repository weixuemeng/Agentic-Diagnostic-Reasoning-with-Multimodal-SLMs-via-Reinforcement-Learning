                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD, lung cancer, CHF, AFib, now with
 chest pain associated with wrist pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Stable and
 chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Severe underlying emphysema,
 there is increased conspicuity of the interstitial markings which suggests
 mild interstitial edema.  Suture material at the left pulmonary hilum is
 compatible with prior partial lung resection.  No large pleural effusions are
 seen, though tiny effusions cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.  There is degenerative disease at the left glenohumeral joint,
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 Underlying emphysema re-demonstrated.
