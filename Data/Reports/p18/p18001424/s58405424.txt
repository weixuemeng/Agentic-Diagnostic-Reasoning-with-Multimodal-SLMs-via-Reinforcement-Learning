                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a moderate to large left pleural effusion, significantly increased as
 compared to the prior study. Small right pleural effusion is stable to
 possibly minimally increased. There is decreased aeration of the lungs. The
 mediastinal contours are grossly stable. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette
 is difficult to to the bibasilar opacities. Had a of the ostia structures
 again it is consistent with known metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in size of left pleural effusion, now moderate to large. Small right
 pleural effusion may be slightly increased.  Bibasilar opacities likely relate
 to pleural effusions and atelectasis although underlying consolidation is
 difficult to entirely exclude.
