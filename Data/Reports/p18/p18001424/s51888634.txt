                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ER-positive breast cancer, on AI  // left
 upper chest rib pain. Pathological fracture?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Known fracture of the lateral aspect 's of the left eleventh rib. Several
 ribs, on both the left and the right side, have heterogeneous appearance
 suggestive of metastatic bone disease. The most ventral part of the tenth left
 rib shows a cortical discontinuity, potentially reflecting a pathologic
 fracture. No other fractures can be clearly identified.
 
 If the clinical suspicion for a pathologic fracture persists, a rib series
 should be performed given the better detection rate of this modality.
