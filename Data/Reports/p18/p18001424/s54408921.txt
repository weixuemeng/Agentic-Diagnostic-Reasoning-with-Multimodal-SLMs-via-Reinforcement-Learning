                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening SOB  // ro CHF      ro CHF
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs with flattening hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  No acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion, and
 the dual-channel pacer device remains in unchanged position.
 The previously seen opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle is not
 definitely appreciated and most likely represented a pericardial fat pad as
 suggested in the previous dictation.
