                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to patient body habitus.  Lung volumes
 are low and exaggerate the pulmonary vascular markings.  There is mild right
 basilar and left retrocardiac atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear and
 without a focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. A tracheostomy
 button is noted in the upper trachea.  Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to patient body habitus and low lung volumes
 demonstrates mild bibasilar atelectasis.
