                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ventilation-acquired
 pneumonia and hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.  
 
 In this short interim, there is slight interval progression in the right
 extensive consolidation which also in part may be due to patient positioning. 
 Both lungs are affected by consolidations in asymmetric extensive fashion. 
 Left retrocardiac consolidation is redemonstrated.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Tubes and lines are unchanged.
