                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Edema or consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications in a patient with consistent enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  This pattern could reflect severe pulmonary edema,
 though supervening pneumonia or even the development of ARDS would have to be
 considered.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
