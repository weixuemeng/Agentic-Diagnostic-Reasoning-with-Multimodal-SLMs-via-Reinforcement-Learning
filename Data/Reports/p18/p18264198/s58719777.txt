                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory distress and hypoxia.  Assess
 for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained.  Left lower lung
 opacification likely reflects a combination of atelectasis, possible
 aspiration or pneumonia, and external soft tissues.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 Small left greater than right pleural effusions are likely also present. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is presumed. Low lung volumes results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings, though there is likely a degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal opacification, which may reflect, atelectasis,
 aspiration and/or infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
