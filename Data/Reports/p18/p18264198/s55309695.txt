                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with respiratory failure, now status post
 intubation for endotracheal tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 the same day at 11:22 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid trachea at
 approximately 3.5 cm away from the carina.  A nasogastric tube is visualized
 with the tip traversing through the stomach but out of the field of view.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Areas of patchy atelectasis as well as bilateral
 small pleural effusions, left greater than right persist.  However, the area
 of patchy atelectasis on the right may be representative of a pnuemonia in the
 proper clinical setting. Moderate pulmonary edema also appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. There is a new endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid trachea at
 approximately 3.5 cm away from the carina.
 
 2. Bibasilar patchy atelectasis, small pleural effusions, and moderate
 pulmonary edema. It is however worth noting that the patchy opacity at the
 right lung base may be representative of a developing pneumonia in the proper
 clinical setting.
