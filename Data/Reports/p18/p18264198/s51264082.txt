 CXR PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT FILM
 
 HISTORY:  Tracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheal tube tip lies 4.6 cm above the carina and is without
 change from examination at 13:24 hours of one day earlier.  NG tube and right
 IJ line noted as before.  Compared to the previous examination, there is
 increasing haziness/opacification in the left lower lung and lingula.  It is
 difficult to assess for volume loss and mediastinal shift due to patient
 rotation.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Increasing volume loss in the left lower lobe, possibly also
 involving the left upper lobe/lingula.
