                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with upper respiratory infection, fevers, and
 cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Ill-defined opacification in the bilateral lower lungs medially
 may represent vascular crowding secondary to low lung volumes with some
 minimal atelectasis, however an infectious process cannot be ruled out.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Ill-defined opacities in the bilateral lower lungs medially may
 represent atelectasis and vascular crowding secondary to low lung volumes,
 however an infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting is also
 possible.
