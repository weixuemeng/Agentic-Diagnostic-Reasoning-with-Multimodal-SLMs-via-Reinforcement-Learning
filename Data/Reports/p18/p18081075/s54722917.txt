                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Influenza like illness. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Again seen is opacification at
 the right lower lobe which appears more consolidated than on the prior study. 
 This may represent a combination of infection or atelectasis. There are
 overall low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable to slight worsening right lower lobe consolidation which may represent
 infection with a component of atelectasis.
