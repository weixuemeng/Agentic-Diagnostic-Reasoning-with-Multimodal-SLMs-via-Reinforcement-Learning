                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with malaise, on immunosuppresion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the previous study. Mild enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated and exaggerated due to the presence of
 low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is re-
 demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted throughout the aorta. The mediastinal contours are similar. Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. Patchy opacities within the left lung base
 may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacity in the left lung base. This may reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.
