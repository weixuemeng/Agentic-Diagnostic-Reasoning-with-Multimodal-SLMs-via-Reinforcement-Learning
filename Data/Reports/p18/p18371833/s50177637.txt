                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left Port-A-Cath placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The projection is somewhat lordotic.  There is an equivocal density
 along the left apex which may represent a pneumothorax.  The left Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the upper SVC.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left apical linear density is equivocal for a small pneumothorax.  Suggest
 repeating with a less lordotic view.
 2.  Left Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper SVC.
