                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post Whipple with portal vein
 reconstruction.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema, acute lung injury.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 502.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 350 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC,
 unchanged.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 to 4
 cm above the carina.  Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished with streaky
 linear opacities predominantly at the left base, improved, likely reflecting
 residual subsegmental atelectasis.  Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with
 no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
