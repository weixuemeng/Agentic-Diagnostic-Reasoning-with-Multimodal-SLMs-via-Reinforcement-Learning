                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new cirrhosis and multifocal PNA who
 developed worsening tachypnea  // evidence of pulmonary edema or new interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 2 days prior, the diffuse,
 bilateral parenchymal opacities have increased in extent and severity, but
 with persistent peripheral sparing.  Increased dilatation of the azygos vein. 
 Small, bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities are more consistent with severe pulmonary
 edema than multifocal pneumonia, but cannot exclude a concurrent infectious
 process.
