 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Diffuse
 alveolar opacities are noted bilaterally, most pronounced and consolidated
 within the upper lobes.  Mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is
 also present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  No pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine with loss of
 height of several upper and mid thoracic vertebral bodies of indeterminate
 age.  Fracture deformity of the right proximal humerus is re- demonstrated,
 better assessed on recent dedicated right shoulder radiographs.
