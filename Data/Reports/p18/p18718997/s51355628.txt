                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lung volumes are low,
 which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  There is a tortuous
 aorta.  The cardiac size is normal.  No acute fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without an acute process.
