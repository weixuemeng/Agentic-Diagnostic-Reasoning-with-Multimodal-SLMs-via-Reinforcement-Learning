                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Patchy medial left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Slight opacification of the right
 cardiophrenic sulcus is probably due to a cardiac fat pad.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are present along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
