 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chest pressure while lying down,
 evaluate for mass lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit
 of normal variation, but no typical configurational abnormality can be
 identified.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened, but does not demonstrate
 any local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested
 and there is no evidence of any new acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates. 
 The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax exists in
 the apical area.  Skeletal structure of the thorax is grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, borderline heart size but no evidence of
 pulmonary congestion, acute infiltrates, pleural effusion or pneumothorax in
 this ___-year-old female patient with chest pressure while lying down.
