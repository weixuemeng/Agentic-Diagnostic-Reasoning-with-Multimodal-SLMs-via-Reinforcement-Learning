                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  The
 aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Convex contour to the right
 superior mediastinum corresponds to tortuous great vessels, unchanged.  No
 pulmonary vascular engorgement is demonstrated.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 could reflect atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.  Degenerative changes of both shoulders are
 noted with narrowed acromial humeral intervals suggestive of underlying
 rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis
 though infection cannot be excluded.
