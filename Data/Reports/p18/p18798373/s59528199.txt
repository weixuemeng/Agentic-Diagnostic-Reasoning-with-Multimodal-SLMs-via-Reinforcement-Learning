                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 infection versus edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hypoinflated. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is
 new. More focal confluent opacity in the left lower lung field, which
 partially obscures the left heart border is noted as well as vague
 opacification of the right lung base.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.  A tortuous aorta is again seen and
 unchanged from prior.  Cardiac size is slightly enlarged, stable.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema and
 bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.
