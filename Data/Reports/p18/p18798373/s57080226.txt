                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with prior LLL consolidations suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the left
 base has decreased.  This could reflect substantial clearing of previous
 consolidation.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
 though the degree of vascular prominence has decreased.
