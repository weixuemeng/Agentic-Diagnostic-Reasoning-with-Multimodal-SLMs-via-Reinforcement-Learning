 in accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of interstitial
 edema, focal consolidation or aspiration is difficult to discern given the low
 lung volumes. Increased interstitial markings are unchanged compared to the
 prior exams.

 the prior study.  No bony abnormalities.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema cannot be excluded. Limited
