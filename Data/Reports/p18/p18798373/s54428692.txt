                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with unresponsiveness and seizure after fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature.  The
 presence of interstitial edema, focal consolidation or aspiration is difficult
 to discern given the low lung volumes and prominent soft tissue.  There is at
 least some atelectasis at the left base.  Size of the cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged by low lung volume.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam by low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary edema cannot be
 excluded.
