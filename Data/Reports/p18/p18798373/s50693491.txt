                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, SOB, hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 most recently from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is moderate bilateral pulmonary edema as well as
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is a more focal area of opacity in the
 left lung base.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted but unchanged.  The
 posterior costophrenic angles are not clearly seen, likely due to small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with a more focal opacity seen in the left lung base.
 Super-imposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
