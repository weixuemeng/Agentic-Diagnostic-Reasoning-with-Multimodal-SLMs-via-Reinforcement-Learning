 HISTORY:  CHF versus pneumonia, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 substantial clearing in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with
 decreased pulmonary edema.  There is an area of confluent opacification at the
 left base that could represent an area of pneumonia.  There is also an area of
 increased opacification in the right infrahilar region.  It is unclear whether
 this could represent also a pneumonic focus or merely an area of some residual
 pulmonary edema.
