                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and headache.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  The heart is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is mild coarsening of background interstitial markings, which may be a
 chronic finding (although not confirmed since no prior studies are available)
 but could be seen with mild background vascular congestion.  Other
 possibilities include airway inflammation.  No focal opacity is seen, however.
 The bones appear demineralized.  An anterior flowing osteophyte is noted along
 mid thoracic vertebral bodies suggesting skeletal hyperostosis.  Calcification
 of some of the thoracic interspaces may be associated with immobility.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post aortic valve replacement with mild coarsening of lung
 markings that could be seen with mild vascular congestion, but potentially
 chronic, although prior studies are not available.  No definite evidence for
 pneumonia.
