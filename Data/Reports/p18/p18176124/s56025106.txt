                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall and head bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is slight increase of interstitial
 markings bilaterally which maybe related to COPD/chronic changes.  There is
 patchy opacity at the right lung base which could be due to aspiration,
 contusion, or infection.  Right middle lobe linear opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Biapical right
 greater than left pleural thickening is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Patchy right base opacity may be due to aspiration, infection, or
 contusion depending on the clinical scenario.  Right middle lobe likely
 atelectasis.
 3.  Large hiatal hernia.
