                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  As seen
 previously, there is a marked kyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction
 visualized on the lateral projection.  There is a retrocardiac opacity which
 could represent the descending thoracic aorta or a hiatal hernia.  The lungs
 appear essentially clear without focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  No
 definite acute bony abnormalities are detected.  Streaky opacities in the left
 lower lung are likely reflective of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.  Severe kyphosis of the thoracolumbar
 junction.
