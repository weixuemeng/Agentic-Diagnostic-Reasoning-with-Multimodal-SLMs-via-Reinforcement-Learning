 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, representing
 metastatic disease.  Bilateral associated mild-to-moderate pleural effusions
 with areas of basal atelectasis.  These areas, however, are unchanged in
 extent and severity as compared to the previous exam.  No newly appeared
 parenchymal opacities that could represent pneumonia.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
