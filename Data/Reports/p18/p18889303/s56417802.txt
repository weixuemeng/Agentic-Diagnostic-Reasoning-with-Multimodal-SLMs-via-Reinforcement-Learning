                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___ and
 CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lower lobe opacification likely represents a combination of the
 patient's tumor burden and moderate effusions as seen on the CT from ___.  There is increased opacification of the left lower lobe which could
 represent tumor progression, atelectasis or a pneumonia.  There is mild
 opacification of the upper lobes of the lungs which is consistent with focal
 airspace opacities.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild increased opacification of left lower lobe could be related to
 compression of the effusion, atelectasis or pneumonia.  Mild upper lobe
 prominence of background pulmonary vascularity suggests mild coinciding
 vascular congestion.
