                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stroke currently with dysphagia needed NG
 replaced.  .
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiographs obtained at 16 25 and
 ___ 29
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the radiograph of 16:29 the Dobbhoff tube projects over the expected
 location of the left hemidiaphragm possibly partially in the esophagus. Right
 lower lobe opacities are worsened with progressive blunting of the
 costophrenic angle likely reflecting combination of small pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Left retrocardiac consolidation is worsening. Irregular opacities
 in the left upper lobe are also progressed. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The Dobbhoff tube projects over the left hemidiaphragm and should be
 advanced approximately 10 cm to place it safely in the stomach.
 2. Persistent retrocardiac consolidation with worsening opacities at the right
 base and left upper lobe may reflect atelectasis, however aspiration and
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting cannot be excluded.
