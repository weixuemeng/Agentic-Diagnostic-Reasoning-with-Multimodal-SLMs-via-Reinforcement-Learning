                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p emergent CABG  // eval for ETT position s/p
 chest closure
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16 23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is now near complete opacification of the
 left chest, with multiple small lucent foci in the upper half of the lung
 which likely represent small areas of aerated long versus focal air within
 fluid.
 
 New compared to the prior study, sternotomy wires and midline mediastinal skin
 ___ are now visualized, compatible with interval surgery.
 
 There has been leftward shift of the mediastinum, likely contributing to the
 left chest opacity.
 
 The left chest tube, mediastinal drains, and 2 Swan-Ganz catheter have all
 shifted leftward.  The plane of imaging of the prosthetic valve is also
 slightly different.  The right chest tube remains in place, canal lying
 slightly lower over the lower right lung.
 
 
 The carina is not well delineated, but I suspect the ET tube tip lies
 approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip and
 side-port overlying the upper stomach.
 
 Aside from mild plethora of  upper zone vessels in the right lung, the right
 lung is grossly clear.
 
 Large rounded calcification, likely a large gallstone, again noted in the
 right upper abdomen
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval surgery, with marked leftward shift of the mediastinum into the left
 chest, together with associated drains, catheters and prosthetic valve, with
 resultant near-complete opacification of the left lung.  This presumably
 suggests significant left-sided atelectasis.
 
 The right lung remains grossly clear, with only mild upper zone
 redistribution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings, including the atypical postoperative appearance of
 the findings, were discussed with, covering clinician, APN ___, by
 Dr ___ by phone at 18:14 on ___, ___ min after discovery.  By
 report, the patient is stable at this time.
