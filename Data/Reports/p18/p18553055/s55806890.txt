                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with syncope, hypotension  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Midline sternotomy wires and
 prosthetic cardiac valve are again seen as well as mediastinal clips.  A
 calcified lesion in the right upper quadrant is again noted consistent with
 calcified lesion in the right renal upper pole as seen on prior CT.  The lungs
 are clear bilaterally without signs of pneumonia or edema.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged with subtle prominence of the main pulmonary artery contour
 which should be correlated for the presence of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Mediastinal contour
 is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with prominence of the main pulmonary artery contour,
 correlate for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
