                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:01 chest radiograph ___ at 13:51 CTA
 torso
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary edema with
 perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, worse since the previous
 examination.  Patchy opacity is seen within the right lung base which may
 reflect aspiration or infection.  The left costophrenic angle is excluded from
 the field of view.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Rounded calcified structure within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
 correlates to a right renal lesion as seen on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Worsening pulmonary edema.
 3. Patchy right basilar opacity which may reflect aspiration or infection.
