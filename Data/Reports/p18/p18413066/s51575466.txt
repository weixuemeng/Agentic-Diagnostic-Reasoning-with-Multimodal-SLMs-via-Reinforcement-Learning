                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with trauma, with right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT cervical spine from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral interstitial opacities, greater on the right
 than the left, and suggestive of moderate to significant interstitial
 pulmonary edema. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax or a consolidation.
 There is a small left pleural effusion but no right effusion. Biapical pleural
 thickening is noted, greater on the right than the left. Post-CABG changes are
 visualized with intact median sternotomy wires.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 are visualized at the aortic arch. Bones are diffusely demineralized and limit
 evaluation for acute fractures.  There is however no gross evidence of an
 acute fracture.  Mild degenerative changes are visualized throughout the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bones are diffusely demineralized and limit evaluation for an acute
 fracture.  However, no definite acute fractures are identified.
 2.  Bilateral interstitial opacities are suggesitve of moderate to significant
 bilateral intersitital edema with a small left pleural effusion.
