  1. Low lung volumes.  Linear opacities at the left greater than right lung
  bases likely represent bibasilar relaxation atelectasis.  No definite focal
  consolidation.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
  2. Large gastric air bubble is noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Hep B cirrhosis now with variceal bleed,
 rising white count and concern for possible aspiration event.  // evaluate for
 any focal consolidation, evidence of PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The stomach is severely distended.  Opacity in the left lower lobe is likely
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes however pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Cardiac size is normal.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Minimal pleural effusions if any.  Mediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The stomach is severely distended.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Recommend conventional
 radiographs with full inspiration when feasible.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Left lower lobe atelectasis versus pneumonia. Recommend
 conventional radiographs with full inspiration when feasible.
