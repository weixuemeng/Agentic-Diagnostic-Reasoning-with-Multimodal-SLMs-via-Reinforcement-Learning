  More conspicuous focal opacity on the lateral view overlying the spine may be
  due to superimposed shadows however close attention to this region is
  suggested.  Repeat film could be attempted or consider nonurgent chest CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of metastatic lymphadenopathy who
 presents the supraclavicular swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is prominence of the hila
 bilaterally compatible with patient's known adenopathy.  Comparing to scouts
 from most recent CT scan there is no definite change.  On the lateral view
 there is more conspicuous focal opacity projecting over the anterior portion
 of a mid to lower thoracic vertebral body which likely is in the right lower
 lobe base on the lateral exam.  Nodule at the left lung base may represent a
 nipple shadow.  Known parenchymal nodules are better characterized by prior
 chest CT.  Elsewhere, the lungs are unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 changed.  No discrete abnormality identified by plain film in the
 supraclavicular region.  Azygos lobe again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 More conspicuous focal opacity on the lateral view overlying the spine may be
 due to superimposed shadows however close attention to this region is
 suggested.  Repeat film could be attempted or consider nonurgent chest CT.
