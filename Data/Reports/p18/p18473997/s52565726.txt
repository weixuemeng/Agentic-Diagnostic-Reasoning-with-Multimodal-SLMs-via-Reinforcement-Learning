                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval enlargement of left superior mediastinal mass displacing
 the trachea to the right with associated coronal tracheal narrowing to 10 mm
 in diameter at the level of the thoracic inlet.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged and accompanied by increased caliber of the pulmonary vasculature, as
 well as peribronchial cuffing and scattered peripheral septal lines. 
 Additionally, multifocal patchy opacities are present in the right middle lobe
 and both lung bases.  Small pleural effusions are also evident.
 
 On the lateral view, the large mediastinal mass results in posterior
 displacement of the trachea.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left superior mediastinal mass consistent with thyroid origin, resulting
 in rightward and posterior tracheal displacement and luminal narrowing.  At
 the time of this report, a CT has been obtained to more fully characterize
 this finding and other cardiothoracic abnormalities.
 
 2.  Findings suggestive of increased volume status.  Asymmetrically
 distributed right mid and bilateral lower lung opacities could reflect
 asymmetrical edema, multifocal aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
