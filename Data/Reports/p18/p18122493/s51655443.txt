 // assess for interval change since preop CXR ___      assess for
 interval change since preop CXR ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are substantially lower today than on ___.  Some of the
 peribronchial opacification new at both lung bases is therefore atelectasis,

 either recent surgery or suspected pneumonia.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Heart size normal.
