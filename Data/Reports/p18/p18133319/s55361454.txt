                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p CABG  // post op baseline
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior studies including ___
 and a preoperative exam of ___..
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the preoperative examination, there is now cardiomegaly.  As
 we cannot exclude a pericardial effusion, clinical findings should dictate the
 need for cardiac ECHO.
 
 There is consolidation/atelectasis in the left lower lobe posteriorly.  On the
 lateral film in the left lung base, there is an air-fluid level suggesting a
 small loculated pneumothorax.  No apical pneumothoraces are present.
 
 A central line is present on the right, the tip projects over the proximal
 right atrium. There is persistent linear atelectasis in the left mid chest
 laterally in the region of the previously noted chest tube which was present
 on the study of ___.
 
 There is a small area of linear atelectasis in the right midlung zone.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  There is consolidation/atelectasis in the left lower lobe posteriorly.
 2.  On the lateral film in the left lung base, there is an air-fluid level
 suggesting a small loculated pneumothorax.
 3.  Postoperative changes are present.  There is cardiomegaly.  If there is
 clinical concern for pericardial effusion, then cardiac echo should be
 considered.
