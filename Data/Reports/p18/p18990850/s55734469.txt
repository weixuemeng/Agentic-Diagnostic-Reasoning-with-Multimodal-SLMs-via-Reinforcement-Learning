                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small right apical pneumothorax appears similar to the recent
 radiograph, with apical visceral pleural line overlying the third right
 posterior rib.  Overall, allowing for differences in technique and projection,
 there has been no substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the
 previous radiograph performed a few hours earlier.
