 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left chest
 tube has been removed.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  Some subcutaneous
 gas along the left lateral chest wall persists, as do previously described
 apical changes bilaterally.
