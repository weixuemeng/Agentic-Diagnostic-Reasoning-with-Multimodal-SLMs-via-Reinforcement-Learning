                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent pneumothoraces, right chest tube, now clamped,
 evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  With the right chest tube now clamped, there is no evidence of
 recurrent pneumothorax.  The subtle linear changes caused by the right apical
 bulla, however, are difficult to differentiate against a small pleural line.
 
 Unchanged right lung changes along the major fissure.  Unchanged appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette.
