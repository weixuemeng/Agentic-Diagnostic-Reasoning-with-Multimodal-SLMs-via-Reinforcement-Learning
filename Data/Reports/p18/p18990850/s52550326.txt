                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R blebectomy  // check interval change     
 check interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification which again on ___, has progressed in the
 right lower lung and perihilar left lung.  The distribution is very asymmetric
 for edema, and raises concern instead for pulmonary hemorrhage or pneumonia.
 Occasionally, pleurodesis can produce a local inflammatory reaction in the
 ipsilateral lung, but that would not explain the appearance of the left lung.
 
 Heart is normal size.  3 right pleural drains are still in place.  Right
 pneumothorax is small if any and there is no appreciable right pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
