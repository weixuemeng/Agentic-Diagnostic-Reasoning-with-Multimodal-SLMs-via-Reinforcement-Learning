 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tubes remain in place. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There
 are increasing patchy opacities at both bases which could reflect atelectasis,
 although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given
 differences in patient positioning. Biapical pleural thickening likely
 reflects postinflammatory changes.
