  Compared to the prior radiograph there has been increased hazy opacity within
  the right base and the left hemithorax, which may represent an asymmetric
  pulmonary edema, and less likely an infectious process. Otherwise, no
  significant interval change in the appearance of the chest.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R pleuredesis w acute onset of R side pain,
 desats to low ___'s, dyspneia  // eval pneumothorax, effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, chest tubes remain in place in the
 right hemi thorax, with the tiny right apical pneumothorax adjacent to
 surgical chain sutures. New airspace opacities are present in the left upper
 lobe extending to the left perihilar region. Additionally, a worsening
 confluent opacity is present in the right lower lung.  These findings may be
 due to multifocal aspiration, asymmetrical edema and less likely rapidly
 evolving pulmonary infection or hemorrhage.  Ste small pleural effusions are
 again demonstrated bilaterally.
