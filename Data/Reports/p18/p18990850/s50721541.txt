                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p L VATS blebectomy and pleurodesis for
 PTX  // perform at 5:30am. r/o interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, left chest tubes remain
 in place, with a tiny left apical pneumothorax, in retrospect unchanged.  Exam
 is otherwise remarkable for pulmonary vascular congestion, mild interstitial
 edema, and worsening left retrocardiac opacity, the latter most likely due to
 atelectasis.
