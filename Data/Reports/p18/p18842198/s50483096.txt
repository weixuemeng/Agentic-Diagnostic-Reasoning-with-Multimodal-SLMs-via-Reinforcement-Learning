                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain status post MVC last week.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild linear in configuration, left lower lung opacity most likely
 represents atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  On the lateral view, a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction appears slightly irregular with
 likely inferior loss of height not well evaluated on this study.  There are no
 priors for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible left base atelectasis.
 2.  Apparent irregularity of the mid-to-lower portion of a vertebral body at
 the thoracolumbar junction, not well evaluated on this study, but injury of
 indeterminate age not excluded.  These findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ ___ at 5:50 p.m. on ___ via telephone.  Thoracolumbar spine
 radiographs will be obtained for further evaluation.
