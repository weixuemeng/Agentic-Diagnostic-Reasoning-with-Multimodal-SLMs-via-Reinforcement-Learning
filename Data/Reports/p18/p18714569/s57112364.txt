 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The central pulmonary interstitium is slightly prominent with peribronchial
 cuffing, which could reflect airway inflammation, but there is no focal
 consolidation.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interstitial prominence; although developing atypical
 pneumonia could be considered, opacities are not strikingly and could be seen
 with airway inflammation.
