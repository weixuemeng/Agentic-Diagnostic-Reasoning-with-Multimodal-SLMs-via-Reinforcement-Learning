                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with thoracic spine tenderness.  Evaluation for
 fracture or infection.
 
 COMPARISON: Comparison is made to radiographs of the left shoulder and
 clavicle from 11 hours ago.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate streaky opacities in
 the bilateral lung bases, consistent with atelectasis.  No pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or definite focal pneumonia is identified.  The
 lung volumes are somewhat low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  A left clavicular fracture is again seen and unchanged since
 the prior study.  No new fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis with no definite evidence of pneumonia. 
 Left clavicular fracture is unchanged.
