                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The aorta is similarly
 tortuous.  There is perhaps slight slight increased widening of the vascular
 pedicle which could be seen with fluid overload.  There is also a slight
 indistinct prominence of pulmonary vascularity suggesting slight vascular
 venous hypertension or perhaps congestion.  Patchy left basilar opacities are
 not specific, but suggest atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings perhaps suggestive of mild vascular congestion.
