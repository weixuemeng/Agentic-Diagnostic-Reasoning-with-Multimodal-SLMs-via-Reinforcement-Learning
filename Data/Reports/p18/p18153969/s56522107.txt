                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Globus sensation in throat, complaining of discomfort in the
 anterior chest, history of exposure to asbestos.  Evaluate for parenchymal
 abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently
 ___.  CTA of the chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pulmonary edema present on most recent chest radiograph has
 resolved and the heart and vascular pedicle are smaller suggesting improvement
 in congestive heart failure.  Tortuosity of the aorta is unchanged.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear.  The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and
 pleural surfaces are normal without pleural calcification.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic findings to suggest sequela of asbestos exposure.
 
 2.  Decrease in heart size and resolution of pulmonary edema suggests
 improvement in congestive heart failure.
