                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right heart border is not as clearly seen as on prior CT, suggesting right
 middle lobe opacity.  No other definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  No bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right heart border not as well seen suggesting right middle lobe opacity,
 potentially atelectasis given lower lung volumes although infection is
 possible.
