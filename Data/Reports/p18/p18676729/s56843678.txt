                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. 
 There are upper lobe predominant reticular and nodular opacities with upper
 lobe volume loss.  There is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and possible on
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the AP window.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Upper lobe predominant reticular and nodular opacities with upper lobe volume
 loss and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  In the absence of older radiographs
 for comparison, the chronicity of these findings is uncertain.  Considering
 history of fever and cough, these findings may be due to viral or other
 atypical pneumonia.  Differential diagnosis includes acute and subacute
 hypersensitivity reactions as well as more chronic processes such as
 sarcoidosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Considering acute infectious symptoms, followup
 radiographs are recommended in 4 weeks after treatment to assess for
 resolution.  If these findings persist or progress on followup radiographs,
 chest CT would be recommended.  Additionally, if older films are available for
 comparison, they would be helpful to determine chronicity of these findings.
