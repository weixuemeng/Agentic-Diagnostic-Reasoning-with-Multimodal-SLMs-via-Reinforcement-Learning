                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  Small left pleural effusion persists, but adjacent
 atelectasis has improved.  Subtle opacity in the right infrahilar region is
 new compared to prior chest radiograph and recent abdominal imaging studies,
 which included the lower chest.  There is no right pleural effusion.  A
 feeding tube remains in place, terminating below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small left pleural effusion.
 2.  New subtle right lower lobe opacity, which may reflect aspiration,
 atelectasis or developing pneumonia.
