                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper SVC as on the prior study. 
 Previously noted focal opacity just lateral to the access port is different in
 appearance than prior exam and likely is part of the access catheter.  There
 is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Previously noted
 rounded opacity projecting inferior to the access port now lies lateral to it
 and likely is part of the catheter.
