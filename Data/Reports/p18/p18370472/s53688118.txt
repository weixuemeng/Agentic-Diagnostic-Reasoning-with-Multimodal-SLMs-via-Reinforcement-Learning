                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of liver cancer and altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  A
 left Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC, not significantly changed.  There has
 been interval extubation and removal of an enteric catheter.  A partially
 imaged catheter projects over the right mid to upper abdomen, not
 significantly changed in appearance.  There is a new density projecting below
 the accessed port in the left upper hemithorax.  The lung fields appear
 otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are not
 significantly changed.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Newly apparent round opacity projecting below the port in the left upper
 hemithorax; repeat radiography, preferably with standard PA and lateral
 technique with deaccessing of the port if feasible, is suggested to reassess. 
 Although the appearance may be associated with the accessed port, the
 possibility of a lung nodule should be excluded with short-term follow-up
 imaging.
 
 Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at 4 pm by telephone
 while the patient was still in the ER.
