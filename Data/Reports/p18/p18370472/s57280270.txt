                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cholangitis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT abdomen
 from ___.
 
 There are new bilateral consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions, not
 seen on the limited view of the CT abdomen.  In addition, there is potentially
 present left mid lung consolidation and right apical consolidation.  Patient
 has azygos lobe, anatomical variant.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid
 SVC.  Overall, the findings might be consistent with bilateral effusions and
 bibasal consolidations reflecting pneumonia, although atelectasis is another
 possibility.
 
 Port-A-Cath placement is unremarkable with the tip in the appropriate
 location.  Biliary stent is projecting over the right upper abdomen.
