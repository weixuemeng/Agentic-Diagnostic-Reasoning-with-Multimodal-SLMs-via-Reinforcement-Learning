                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with follow up PA/Lat as recommended by
 radiology.  // follow up PA/Lat xray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved, now mild. The
 right hilum is less prominent, compatible with previous vascular engorgement.
 There is no evidence for a hilar mass. Overall, the appearance is concerning
 for pulmonary valvular pathology, and an echocardiogram is recommended for
 further evaluation if clinically indicated. There is unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions. There is
 no pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improvement of right hilar contour, no further followup required.
 2. Improved pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion, now mild.
 3. Vascular distribution suggests pulmonary valve pathology, echocardiogram is
 recommended if clinically indicated.
