 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Previous focal abnormality in the right upper lobe is now obscured by
 increasing mild edema in the right lung.  The finding can be explained either
 by earlier pneumonia or mitral regurgitation leading to asymmetric edema in
 the right lung, particularly upper lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 stable but moderate cardiomegaly is slightly worse.
