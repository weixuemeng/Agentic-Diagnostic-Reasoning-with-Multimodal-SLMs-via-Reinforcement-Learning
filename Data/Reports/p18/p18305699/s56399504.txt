                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with mild shortness of breath, decreased
 breath sounds on right.  Rule out effusion or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.  This
 study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left.  There is also left lung base atelectasis
 with some associated volume loss.  There is no focal area of consolidation,
 significant pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  A right Port-A-Cath is seen in
 standard position, terminating in the right atrium.  Metallic clips overlying
 the left lower hemithorax and a single metallic radiodensity overlying the
 left axilla are seen, and correlate with surgical clips seen in the breast and
 left axilla on recent CT scan.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions worse on the right.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis with associated volume loss.  No pneumothorax or significant
 pulmonary edema.
