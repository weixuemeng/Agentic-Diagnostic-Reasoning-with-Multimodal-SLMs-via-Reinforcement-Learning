                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizure, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Minimal linear
 opacity at the left lung base is most compatible with atelectasis, though a
 very subtle consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.  Remainder of the lungs
 appear clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very subtle opacity at the left lung base could in the correct
 clinical setting represent an early pneumonia or aspiration.
