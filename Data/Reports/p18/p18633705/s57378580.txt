 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The medial left hemidiaphragm is
 partially obscured by a rounded opacity, which could represent atelectasis but
 cannot exclude a mass lesion.  The lungs are otherwise well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 which could represent crowding of vessels from adjacent diaphragmatic
 elevation, but cannot exclude a mass lesion.  Recommend nonurgent CT to
 exclude possible mass.
