                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and persistent left base rales.  Rule out infiltrate or volume
 loss.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs ___, ___ in ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is a focal opacity in the right infrahilar region, partially
 obscuring the right heart border and likely within the middle lobe.  Linear
 atelectasis is seen at the left lung base.  Lung volumes are low which results
 in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 Rounded opacities are seen within the right upper quadrant.  Cholecystectomy
 clips, mediastinal clips and sternotomy wires are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Focal right infrahilar opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Recommend
 follow up CXR in 4 to 6 weeks to document resolution after completion of
 antibiotic therapy.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:09 on ___ by telephone ___ minutes after discovery.
