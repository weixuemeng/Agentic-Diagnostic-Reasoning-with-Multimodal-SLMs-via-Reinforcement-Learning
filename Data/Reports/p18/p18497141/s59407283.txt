                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient admitted with aspiration
 with worsening dyspnea.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest is compared to prior study obtained the
 same day earlier as well as ___.
 
 There is continued progression of widespread parenchymal opacities, extensive
 that most likely represent a combination of progressing multifocal pneumonia
 with superimposed pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted. 
 The heart and mediastinum are difficult to assess since they are obscured
 partially by the consolidations.
