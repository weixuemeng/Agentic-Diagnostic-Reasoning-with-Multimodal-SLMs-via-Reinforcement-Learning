 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress and concern for bibasilar pneumonia versus
 aspiration, assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate
 cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic knob. There is no pneumothorax.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are worsened compared to the prior study. 
 Bibasilar opacities have also progressed, consistent with aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of bibasilar opacities, small bilateral pleural
 effusions, and moderate pulmonary edema.
