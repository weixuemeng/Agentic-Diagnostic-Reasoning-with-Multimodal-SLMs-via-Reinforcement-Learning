                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen, which may relate to atelectasis; however, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, consolidation due to infection or pneumonia is
 not excluded.  There is also a new opacity projecting over the lateral left
 mid lung seen on the frontal view, not as well evaluated on the lateral view,
 which may represent another site of atelectasis/collapse.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may in part relate to atelectasis, although
 underlying infection, pneumonia and/or aspiration is of concern in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally, there is new lateral left lung
 opacity which is nonspecific, but could relate to an additional site of
 consolidation including pulmonary infarct.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ at 8:15 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
