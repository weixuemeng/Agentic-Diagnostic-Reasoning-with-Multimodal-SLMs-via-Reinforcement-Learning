                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post change in PICC line positioning.  The patient also
 presents with productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided PICC line has been retracted and now terminates at
 the level of the mid clavicular line along the expected course of the right
 subclavian vein.  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged with left
 ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Persistent band-like opacities in the left mid lung suggest minor
 atelectasis or scarring.  There is a patchy new nonspecific opacity in the
 right lower lung, although suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Developing
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude, however.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative changes involving the right shoulder are
 partly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Retraction of PICC line, which now terminates in the mid subclavian vein.
 
 2.  Patchy right basilar opacity, although compatible with minor atelectasis. 
 The possibility of developing pneumonia is not entirely excluded, however, and
 short-term followup radiographs could be considered if symptoms were to
 persist or worsen.
