                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure, asthma, and atrial fibrillation with three weeks of cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable.  Right lung opacity
 has improved, but there is still present right basal opacity that potentially
 might reflect infectious process.  There is also left mid lung opacity which
 is new and might reflect additional focus of infection as well.  Followup of
 the patient with four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
 required.
