                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right PIC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to 8:16 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the wire in the left PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic
 veins, and the catheter extends at least 2 cm beyond that point into the upper
 SVC.  Large bullae at the lung bases are responsible for atelectasis.  Heart
 is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema.
