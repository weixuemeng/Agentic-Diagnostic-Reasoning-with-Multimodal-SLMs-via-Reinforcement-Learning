                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval increase in
 bibasilar opacity, without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged, the mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged.  There is no edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectases, and mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  If there is clinical concern for infection, recommend
 repeat dedicated AP and lateral views in the department.
