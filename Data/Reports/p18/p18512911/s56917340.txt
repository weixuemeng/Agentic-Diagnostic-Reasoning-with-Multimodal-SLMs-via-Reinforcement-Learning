                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Wheezing, productive cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal and
 hilar contours.  Stable mild cardiomegaly evident.  Increased opacity
 overlying the right diaphragm on background of right lower lung atelectasis,
 may indicate pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
 Stable L1 and T12 compression fractures.  Stable degenerative changes of the
 right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity of right lower lung may reflect worsening
 atelectasis, though in proper clinical setting, pneumonia is a possibility. 
 No pleural effusion evident.
