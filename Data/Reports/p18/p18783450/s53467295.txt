                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with relapsed cholangiocarcinoma and
 liver transplant, on chemotherapy, admitted for bacteremia.  Transient hypoxia
 last night, evaluate for infiltrate or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The configuration demonstrates a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly but no
 evidence of marked left atrial enlargement.  Thoracic aorta is mildly widened
 but does not show any local contour abnormalities.  A right-sided internal
 jugular vein approach Port-A-Cath system is noted and the line terminates in
 mid-to-lower SVC.  No pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  There is no evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates. 
 There is mild blunting of the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses, but in
 the absence of acute pulmonary congestion, these findings are most likely
 related to patient's past medical history, which includes a liver transplant,
 probably represent pleural scar formations.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on either side.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiac enlargement with left ventricular prominence, but
 absence of acute pulmonary congestion or left atrial enlargement.  No acute
 infiltrates.  Bilateral pleural scar formations, probably related to past
 history.  Thus, presently no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or
 significant CHF.
