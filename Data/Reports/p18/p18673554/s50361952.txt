                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube placement, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is now a right pigtail
 catheter in place with substantial decrease in the amount of pleural fluid. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Substantial opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with high
 level volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion.
 
 The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
