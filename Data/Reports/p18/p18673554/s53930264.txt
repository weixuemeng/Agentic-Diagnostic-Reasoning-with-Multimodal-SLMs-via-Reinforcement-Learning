  1. Interval decrease in left pleural effusion compared to the prior study
  status post recent thoracentesis.  Left pigtail drian in place.
  
  2. Stable moderate right pleural effusion
  
  3. Irregular apperance of the left mediastinal border may be due to lingular
  collapse, but is similar in apperance to prior studies.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Adenocarcinoma, presumed lung primary, evaluation for pleural
 effusions after thoracocentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 left thoracocentesis.  There currently is no convincing evidence for the
 presence of a left pneumothorax.  A triangular portion of relatively extensive
 thickening around the left hilus obviously reflects the known thoracic
 malignancy.  The extent of the pleural effusion has decreased.  A pleural
 catheter is now visible, inserted at the region of the left costophrenic
 sinus.  The right lung shows unchanged appearance.
