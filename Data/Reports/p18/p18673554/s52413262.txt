                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single semi-supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubated with SVC syndrome and decreased left lung
 sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:52.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm
 above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 level of the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not included on the image. 
 Inferior vena cava stent is stable in position and appearance.  Left pigtail
 chest tube is again seen.  There are small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Additional right base opacity is seen,
 which in part be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis;
 however, consolidation is also likely present.  Minimal increase in the
 perihilar opacities consistent with mild edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  Persistent right lower lung consolidation.  Interval development
 of mild pulmonary edema.
