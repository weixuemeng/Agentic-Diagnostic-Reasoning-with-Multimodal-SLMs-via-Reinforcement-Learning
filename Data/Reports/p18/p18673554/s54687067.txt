                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with lung mass, superior vena cava syndrome, now with
 worsened O2 requirement, evaluation for pneumothorax or other intrathoracic
 process, evaluate for O2 desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Loculated moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion have
 increased.  There is also heterogeneous increase in bilateral left more than
 right lung opacities which could reflect either aspiration or pneumonia. 
 Widening of the mediastinum is due to known malignancy.  Pericardial catheter
 has been removed.
 
 CONCLUSION  
 
 1.  Increase in loculated moderate left pleural effusion and small right
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Worsening heterogeneous bilateral opacities, left more than right, which
 could reflect aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
