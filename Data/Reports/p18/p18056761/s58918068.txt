                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Asthma, presenting with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  More extensive opacity
 than before in the right lower lung, seemingly obscuring the right cardiac
 border to some extent, suggests middle lobe opacity.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 remain clear, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia.
