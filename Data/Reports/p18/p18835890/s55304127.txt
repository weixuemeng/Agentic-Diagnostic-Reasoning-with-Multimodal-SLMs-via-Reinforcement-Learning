                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute kidney injury, recent cardiac surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.   Patient is
 status post median sternotomy as well as cardiac valve replacement.  As noted
 on the chest radiograph from ___, similar in appearance to that study,
 there is suggestion of possible pulmonary nodules at the lung bases which may
 be due to overlapping structures; however, chest CT would be needed for
 further evaluation.  There is mild left base atelectasis/scarring.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Query basilar nodular opacities versus overlap of structures,
 similar in appearance to chest radiograph from ___, chest CT would be
 needed for further evaluation, as also mentioned on that study.  Left base
 atelectasis/scarring.
