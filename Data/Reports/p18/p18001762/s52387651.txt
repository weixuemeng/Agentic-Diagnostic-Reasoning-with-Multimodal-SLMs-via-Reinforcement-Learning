                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with wheezing  // eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are low and
 evaluation is somewhat limited due to underpenetrated technique likely in part
 due to large body habitus.  The heart size appears enlarged though a component
 may be due to AP technique.  There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia,
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild congestion difficult to exclude given
 technique though there is no overt edema.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible mild congestion.  Limited exam.
