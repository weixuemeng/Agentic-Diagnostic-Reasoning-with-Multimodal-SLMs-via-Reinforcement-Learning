                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain. Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiac silhouette
 and lungs which are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  A widened mediastinum is likely due to mediastinal lipomatosis
 and appear similar to prior studies. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. No pneumothorax identified.
