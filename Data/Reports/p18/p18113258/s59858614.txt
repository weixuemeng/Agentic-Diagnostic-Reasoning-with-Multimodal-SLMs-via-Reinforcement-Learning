                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for two weeks, right upper lobe rhonchi 
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear
 except for linear opacity in the left mid lung that might represent a focal
 area of scarring.  No focal consolidation to suggest infectious process
 demonstrated.
