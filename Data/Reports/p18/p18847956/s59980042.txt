                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of severe cough.  Please evaluate for pneumonia or rib
 fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.  Chest CT
 from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  Scarring within the lung apices is unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures are
 identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified.  
 
 2. No rib fractures are identified, however conventional radiographs are not
 effective in evaluating the chest cage. If there is further clinical concern,
 a marker at the site of focal tenderness with dedicated rib films would be
 recommended for further evaluation.
