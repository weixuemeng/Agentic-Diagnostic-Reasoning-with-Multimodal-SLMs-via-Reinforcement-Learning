                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, diabetes and recent altered
 mental status with hypoxia, status post diuresis.  Evaluate for improvement in
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest radiograph is provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is improved expansion of the lungs.  Pulmonary edema in the
 upper lung zones has improved.  Compared to the prior exam, there is new
 opacity at the bases which may represent atelectasis or dependent residual
 edema; however, aspiration or aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The
 heart remains significantly enlarged.  Linear opacities in the left mid lung
 zone is compatible with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are
 small effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall improved pulmonary edema, but worsening bibasilar opacities which may
 represent atelectasis or residual dependent edema; however, aspiration or
 aspiration pneumonia is also possible.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful.
