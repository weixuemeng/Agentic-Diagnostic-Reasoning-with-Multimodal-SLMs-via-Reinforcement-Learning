                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea
 on exertion.  Intermittent dry cough.  History of cardiac disease, rule out
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a new
 hazy opacification in the right lower lung which obscures a portion of the
 diaphragmatic surface and is only visible on the AP view.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent pneumonia.  The left lung is grossly
 clear, and there is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is unchanged, and the median sternotomy wires
 remain in the same position compared to the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  New right lower lung opacity could represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 15:34, 5 minutes after the finding was discovered.
