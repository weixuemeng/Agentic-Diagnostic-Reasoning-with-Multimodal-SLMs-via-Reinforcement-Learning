                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, diabetes, history of failure
 status post debridement.
 
 CHEST, AP:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart remains enlarged with evidence of prior CABG.  Some upper zone
 redistribution is again noted consistent with known failure.  The residual
 opacities seen on the prior chest x-ray in the right base have resolved
 consistent with improving failure.  The right costophrenic angle appears
 clear.  The left is not quite visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly and some upper zone redistribution indicating
 improving failure.
