                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and cholangitis status post
 intubation, evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip approximately
 4 cm above the carina.  Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in
 position with the tip in the proximal SVC.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is
 increasing bibasilar opacities with increasing fullness of the perihilar
 vasculature and a suggestion of some peribronchial cuffing.  These findings
 most likely represent mild pulmonary edema with associated compressive
 atelectasis and a left pleural effusion.  An infectious process would be less
 likely.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable given differences in positioning.  The patient's mandible obscures
 the lung apices.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
