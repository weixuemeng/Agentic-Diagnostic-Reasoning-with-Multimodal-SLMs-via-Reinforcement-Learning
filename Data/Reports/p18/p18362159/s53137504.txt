                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // ? pna? ich
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and slightly tortuous,
 similar to ___.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution possible slight vascular plethora, but no
 overt CHF.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with crowding of vessels in the right
 cardiophrenic region.  No discrete focal infiltrate or frank consolidation is
 identified.  Linear densities in the lower lobe posteriorly on the lateral
 view are thought to represent superimposition of vascular and osseous shadows.
 
 No pleural effusion seen on either side.
 
 Tiny (2.3 mm) calcified granuloma in the right upper zone laterally overlying
 the right fourth posterior rib.
 
 Osteopenia and degenerative change of the thoracic spine are noted.  At the
 edge of this film, incidental note is made of degenerative changes in the
 shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, with calcified, slightly tortuous aorta.
 
 Upper zone redistribution with slight vascular plethora, compatible with mild
 fluid overload.  No overt CHF.
 
 Elevated, eventrated right hemidiaphragm.  This is associated with crowding of
 vessels in the right infrahilar region.  Both findings are slightly more
 pronounced than in ___.  The appearance is more suggestive of
 atelectasis/scarring than an acute infiltrate.  The possibility of an early
 infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis in this location is considered
 unlikely, but cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions.
