                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a central venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from 4 hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement
 of a right internal jugular line, which terminates in the mid SVC.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax, or other complication.  The heart size appears
 mildly increased in size since the prior study, with hazy opacifications in
 the right upper lung and right lung base.  These findings could represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, however the right lower lobe opacity suggests
 possible underlying pneumonia.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right IJ central venous line in appropriate position, with no pneumothorax
 or other associated complication.
 
 2. Right upper and right lower lung opacities, and mild increase in heart size
 since the prior study could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema alone, however
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Followup radiographs are
 recommended.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 8:00 on ___, within 10 minutes of discovery.
