                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, URI symptoms and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  Consolidative opacity within the
 right lower lobe is concerning for infection.  Minimal patchy opacity in left
 lung base may also reflect an area of atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Previously noted nodular opacity projecting over the right upper
 lung field has resolved.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia. 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe may also reflect an area of infection or
 atelectasis.  Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution of these findings.
