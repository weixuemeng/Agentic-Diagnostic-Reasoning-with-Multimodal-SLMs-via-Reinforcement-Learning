   Relatively symmetric widening of the superior mediastinum without tracheal
  deviation.  Findings could be due to prominent vascular structures or possibly
  a thyroid goiter.  Further evaluation with a chest CT on a non urgent basis
  can be obtained for further evaluation.
  
  No acute process otherwise.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Exertional chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The hilar contours are normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are notable for symmetric widening of the superior
 mediastinum bilaterally, without deviation of the trachea.  Prominent left
 epicardial fat pad is noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Within the
 periphery of the right upper lung field is a 2.5 cm rounded lucency with a
 thin wall which could represent a bulla.  The remainder of the lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Relatively symmetric widening of the superior mediastinum without tracheal
 deviation.  Findings could be due to prominent vascular structures or possibly
 a thyroid goiter.  Further evaluation with a chest CT on a non urgent basis
 can be obtained for further evaluation.
 
 2.  2.5 cm lucent lesion within the right upper lung field, likely a bulla.
