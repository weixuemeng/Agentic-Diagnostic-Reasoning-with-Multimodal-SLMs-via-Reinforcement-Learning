                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, heart size is
 normal.  Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is again demonstrated with
 adjacent areas of parenchymal scarring.  A patchy area of opacity in the right
 infrahilar region is new, but lungs otherwise appear similar to the prior
 study.  Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy right juxtahilar opacity, which could reflect an early
 or resolving focus of pneumonia.  Followup radiographs in four weeks may be
 helpful to document complete resolution as entered in radiology communications
 dashboard on ___.
