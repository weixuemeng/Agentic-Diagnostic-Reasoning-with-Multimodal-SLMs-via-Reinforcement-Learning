                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent aspiration pneumonia, now returning
 with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are low.  Opacities within the
 lung bases, left greater than right, is unchanged compared to recent prior
 examination and may reflect persistent atelectasis or resolving aspiration as
 suggested by the clinical history.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle suggests persistent small effusion.  The upper lungs appear clear.  A
 known 14 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is not well seen on this
 radiographic examination.  There is no pneumothorax.  No vascular congestion
 or overt pulmonary edema is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits and unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes. Unchanged bibasilar opacities and probable small left
 pleural effusion.  Differential includes chronic atelectasis or aspiration or
 infection depending on clinical situation.  Given low lung volumes, PA and
 lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation, if patient able.
 2.  No new focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
