 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear of focal opacities concerning for infection.  A
 1 cm calcified structure projects over the descending aorta on the frontal

 additional calcified granuloma, sub-4-mm in size is also noted in the left
 hemithorax projecting underneath the sixth posterior rib.  Cardiac size and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 abdominal free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Prior granulomatous
 exposure.
