                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath, unsteadiness on feet.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Heart
 size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with
 mild aortic knob calcifications re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present.  Mild
 bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of
 congestive heart failure.
