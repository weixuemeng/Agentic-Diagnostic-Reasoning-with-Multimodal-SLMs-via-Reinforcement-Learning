                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with cough, knee pain  // eval for pna, fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited secondary to relatively low lung volumes and patient body
 habitus.  On the frontal view, there is apparent pleural-based thickening on
 the left laterally.  The lungs are clear of consolidation.  The second lateral
 view with less motion demonstrates no obvious effusion or definite
 consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is likely within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
