                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe pneumonia and COPD, for followup.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse interstitial markings consistent with
 chronic pulmonary disease.  The area of increased opacification at the right
 base medially has improved, though not cleared.  The suspected air-fluid level
 of a right mid zone bulla is not definitely appreciated on this study.  Repeat
 radiographs in another four weeks would be helpful to follow up the resolution
 of this process.
