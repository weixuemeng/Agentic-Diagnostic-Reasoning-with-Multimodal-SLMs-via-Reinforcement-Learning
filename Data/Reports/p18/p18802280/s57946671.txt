                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with previously diagnosed right lower lobe
 pneumonia, here to re-evaluate for resolution of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs performed on ___, ___,
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a persistent
 bulla in the posterior right lower lobe best appreciated on the lateral
 radiograph.  Persistent linear opacities in the right lung base likely
 represent scarring.  The right costophrenic angle is clear without pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 coarse interstitial markings consistent with background COPD/emphysema, which
 is unchanged over multiple prior studies.  The overall appearance of the lungs
 is unchanged from the preceding radiograph without new focal consolidation. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous.  Healed rib
 fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with COPD/emphysema with stable scarring of
 the right lung base and a posterior right lower lobe bulla without evidence of
 acute infection.
