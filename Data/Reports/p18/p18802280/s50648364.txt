                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with cough and decreased O2 sats.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest show a consolidation within the
 right lower lobe consistent with an underlying infectious process.  Adjacent
 to this area is a bulla with an air-fluid level.  The wall of the bulla is not
 thickened, which suggests that it is not an abscess.  Would follow up these
 findings with a repeat chest radiograph in four weeks to ensure resolution. 
 There are stable coarse interstitial lung markings with relative upper lung
 lucencies consistent with patient's known history of COPD.  There are multiple
 unchanged old rib fractures in the right upper ribs.  There is a prominent
 main pulmonary artery which is consistent with a history of pulmonary
 hypertension.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity with an adjacent fluid-filled bulla is
 consistent with underlying infectious process.  Would follow up with repeat
 chest radiograph in four weeks to ensure resolution.
 
 Results were communicated with Dr. ___ ___ assistant at 3 p.m. on
 ___ via telephone by Dr. ___.
