                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturations.  Evaluate for heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is prominence of the central
 vasculature with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities are
 noted on a background of known emphysema.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged, increased from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings are most consistent with pulmonary edema; however,
 bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia/aspiration.
