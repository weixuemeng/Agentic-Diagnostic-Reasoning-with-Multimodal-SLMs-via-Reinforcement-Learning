 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with power picc  // placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 17:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC line is coiled over right axilla, similar position.  Right IJ
 central line tip near cavoatrial junction, similar.  Near complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax, with decreased lung aeration compared
 with yesterday.  Shallow inspiration accentuates pulmonary vascularity.  Heart
 size is difficult to assess given opacification of the right hemithorax. 
 There is no consolidations in the left chest.  Again seen is osseous defect
 right eighth rib, similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC line is coiled in the right axilla, similar position compared the
 prior exam.  Virtually complete opacification of the right hemothorax, likely
 combination of effusion and atelectasis; infiltrate cannot be excluded. 
 Prominent vascularity in the left lung may be partially accentuated from
 shallow inspiration.
