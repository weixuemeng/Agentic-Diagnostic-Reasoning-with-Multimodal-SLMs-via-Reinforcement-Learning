                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent stroke and pneumonia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Linear opacities at the right base are
 similar to the prior radiograph, and likely represents atelectasis.  There is
 no focal airspace opacity.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically no evidence of
 pneumonia.
