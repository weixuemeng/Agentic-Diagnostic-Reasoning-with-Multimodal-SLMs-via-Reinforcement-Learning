                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, cough and known pulmonary
 embolism.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Slightly increased bibasilar
 opacities likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified. There is no free
 air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis given low lung
 volumes, but aspiration, early infection or early infarction are not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting. If clinically indicated, conventional
 frontal and lateral radiographs might be helpful for further evaluation.
