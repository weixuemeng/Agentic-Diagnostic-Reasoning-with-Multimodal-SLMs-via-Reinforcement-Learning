 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette size is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There may be slight central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without pulmonary edema.
