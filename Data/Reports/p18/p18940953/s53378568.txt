 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient slightly rotated.  Lung volumes are low.  Bilateral increased
 pulmonary congestion with moderate edema is demonstrated.  Opacity in the
 right lower lobe with silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm likely reflects
 a combination of a small right pleural effusion, atelectasis, and edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  No appreciable left pleural effusion.  No acute osseous
 abnormality.  The heart is moderately enlarged, similar to the prior exam.

 Findings most consistent with congestive heart failure and a right pleural
 effusion.
