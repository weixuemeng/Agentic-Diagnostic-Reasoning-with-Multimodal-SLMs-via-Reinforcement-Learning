                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sepsis, status post left internal jugular
 central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate
 to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is moderate pulmonary edema, not
 substantially changed in the interval.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Hazy opacification of the right hemi thorax towards the lung base
 likely reflects the presence of a layering pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is likely present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the upper SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  Re- demonstration of moderate pulmonary edema and layering
 right pleural effusion.
