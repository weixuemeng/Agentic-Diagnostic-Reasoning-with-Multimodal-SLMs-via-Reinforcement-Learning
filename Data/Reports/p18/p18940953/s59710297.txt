 amputation.  History of diabetes, coronary artery disease.
 
 CHEST
 
 The heart is enlarged.  Increased opacity is again noted in the left lower

 therefore pneumonic consolidation becomes more likely.  Some failure is likely
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased densities right lower lobe possibly caused by
 pneumonia.
