 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAD, sCHF (LVEF ___%), IDDM2, atrial
 fibrillation on apixaban with prior polymicrobial inxn  // eval for signs of
 infection     eval for signs of infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and bilateral
 layering pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, with underlying
 basilar atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
