                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rapid atrial fibrillation, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified, and there is
 mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 noted, with streaky right basilar opacity, possibly reflecting asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Streaky right basilar opacity could
 reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.
