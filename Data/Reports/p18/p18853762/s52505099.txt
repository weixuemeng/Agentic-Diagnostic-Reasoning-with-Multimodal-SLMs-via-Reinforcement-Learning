                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and increased oxygen requirement after
 joint replacement.  Rule out PE.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 much lower lung volume exaggerates mild cardiomegaly, but progression of
 pulmonary vascular engorgement accompanied by mild interstitial edema in the
 lower lungs has an indication of cardiac decompensation.  Lateral view shows
 heavy calcification in the aortic valve, which could be hemodynamically
 significant.  The patient should be evaluated, therefore for possible calcific
 aortic stenosis.  Thoracic aorta is generally tortuous and heavily calcified
 but not focally dilated.  There are no findings to suggest pneumonia.  Dr.
 ___ was paged.  Dr. ___ was paged at 12:10 p.m.
