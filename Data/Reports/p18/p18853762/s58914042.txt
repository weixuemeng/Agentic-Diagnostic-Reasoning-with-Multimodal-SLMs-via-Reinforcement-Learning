                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___
 ___ Dr. ___ Dr. ___.  CTA of the thorax from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates relatively low lung volumes
 compared to the prior study with persistent interstitial prominence and
 minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Hazy opacity in the right lung
 base likely represents atelectasis, however underlying infection cannot be
 completely excluded. The cardiac silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hazy opacity in the right lung base likely represents atelectasis in the
 presence of low lung volumes, however, underlying infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
