                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Delirium, status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, four views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 The hilar contours are unchanged.  The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded.  Again
 appreciated are diffuse increased interstitial lung markings suggestive of
 chronic interstitial abnormality.  There is no focal consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The osseous
 structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared to prior study with
 redemonstration of mild hyperinflation and global increased interstitial
 markings most compatible with emphysema.
