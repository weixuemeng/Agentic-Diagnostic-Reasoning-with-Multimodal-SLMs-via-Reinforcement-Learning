 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. 
 
 FINDINGS: Prominence of the interstitium is thought to reflect changes of
 chronic lung disease, as there is no convincing evidence for pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal airspace consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but
 unchanged.  There is no free air seen underneath the diaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
