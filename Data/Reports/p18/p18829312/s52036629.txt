                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST DATED ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new subtle area of consolidation has developed in the right lower
 lobe, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.  Remainder of lungs are
 clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance since the
 previous radiograph.  There are no pleural effusions.  Thoracic scoliosis and
 compression deformities in the spine appear similar to the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal/early right basilar pneumonia.
