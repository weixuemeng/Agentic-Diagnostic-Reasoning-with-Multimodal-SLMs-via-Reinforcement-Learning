                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ex-lap, LOA, VHR with not making urine s/p
 fluid bolus  // please eval for any pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT abdomen ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent elevation the right hemidiaphragm with consequent low lung
 volumes on the right.  The left lung appears grossly clear.  There may be a
 tiny left pleural effusion.  A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is just
 below the left hemidiaphragm and the spinal appears to be at approximately the
 level the gastroesophageal junction.  This could be advanced for better
 position within the stomach.  No consolidation seen.  No pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.  There may be a tiny left pleural
 effusion.
 
 The nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm in the upper
 stomach, the side hole is at approximately the level the gastroesophageal
 junction.  This could be advanced several cm for better positioning in the
 gastric lumen.
