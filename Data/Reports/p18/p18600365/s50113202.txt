                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right pleural effusion s/p chest tube  //
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___ at 17:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
 been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter.  Right-sided
 pleural effusion has essentially resolved.  Small left pleural effusion
 persists.  There is a small right apical pneumothorax measuring approximately
 15 mm from the chest cage.  There is mild right basilar atelectasis.  Heart is
 normal in size.  Right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 Multiple radiodensities projecting over the right upper quadrant are
 consistent with prior embolization of multiple portal venous branches.
 
 Lucency projecting superior to the pigtail catheter at may represent expected
 subcutaneous emphysema or air captured in between skin folds.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small 15 mm right apical pneumothorax, without evidence of tension.
 2. Interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter, with resolution of
 the large right pleural effusion.  Mild right basilar atelectasis.
 3. Small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:40 PM, 2 minutes after
