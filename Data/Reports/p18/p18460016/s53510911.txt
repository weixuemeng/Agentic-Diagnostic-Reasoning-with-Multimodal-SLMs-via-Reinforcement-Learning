                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right shoulder and humerus pain after
 fall, evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The
 bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is
 unchanged in comparison to prior study, likely related to crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no focal lung consolidation, however
 evaluation of the right lung base is limited due to patient's hand projecting
 over this location.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Study limited study due to patient's extremities overlying the right lung
 base.  Within this limitation, no focal lung consolidation or evidence of
 other acute cardiopulmonary process.
