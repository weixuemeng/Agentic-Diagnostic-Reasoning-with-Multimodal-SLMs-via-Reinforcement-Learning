                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  No definite fracture is identified.  A
 fluid level is identified in the upper portion of a dilated esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No definite fracture.  Please note
 that conventional radiography is limited for evaluation of chest wall trauma.
 2. An air fluid level is present within the upper aspect of a dilated
 esophagus which is suggestive of achalasia or esophageal diverticulum and was
 present on prior study.  Recommend further characterization with an upper GI
 barium study or CT.
 
 Impression item #2 was emailed to the ED QA Nursing staff.
