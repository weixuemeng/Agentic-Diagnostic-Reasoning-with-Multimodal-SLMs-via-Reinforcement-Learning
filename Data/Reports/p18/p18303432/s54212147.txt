                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and cough with green sputum.  Evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is an overall increased radiodensity in the lungs, most pronounced in
 the right upper lobe.  There are areas of parenchymal opacity seen adjacent to
 the minor fissure.  The minor fissure is elevated and the apical part of the
 right upper lobe shows air bronchograms and peribronchial thickening with a
 linear opacity at the lung apex.  Similar findings, but with less severity,
 are seen in both lower lobes.  No complications including abscesses or
 adenopathy are seen.  The heart is normal in size and the aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Scattered, parenchymal opacities highly suspicious for infection.
