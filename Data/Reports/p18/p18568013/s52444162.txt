 cannot represent radiation pneumonia from therapy directed properly at the
 left lower lobe mass which appears slightly smaller than it did on a
 pre-treatment chest radiograph ___.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema is no longer present, although heart is still
 quite large.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.
