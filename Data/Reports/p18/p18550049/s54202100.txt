                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with sick sinus syndrome, status post
 dual-chamber permanent pacemaker redo with right ventricular lead failure. 
 Now with new right ventricular lead placement via axillary vein, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA
 and lateral chest examination of ___.  The frontal view AP chest
 image does not disclose any pneumothorax in this patient who recently has
 undergone revision of failing permanent pacer.  Comparison is made with a
 previous study.  One can also identify that a new different type pacemaker
 capsule has been inserted.  A new third electrode reaches in a position
 compatible with apical portion of the right ventricle.  Noteworthy is that the
 previously present remains in unchanged position with its tip, a finding which
 also holds for the right atrial electrode.  Unfortunately, there are multiple
 probably external wires overlying the area making interpretation uncertain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax, no new acute pulmonary infiltrates.
