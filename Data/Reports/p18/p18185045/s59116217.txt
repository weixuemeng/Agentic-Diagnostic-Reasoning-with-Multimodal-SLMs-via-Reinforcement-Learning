                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of cholangiocarcinoma with liver
 metastases.  Had biliary drain and stent placed last week.  The patient is
 hypoxic on room air.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There is mild blunting of the
 costophrenic on the right which may represent a small pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized on this semi-upright radiograph.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips are visualized superior to the
 right clavicle.  There is a healed left clavicle fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly representing atelectasis with
 aspiration and pneumonia not excluded.  Small right pleural effusion.
