                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status  // presence of
 pleural effusions or interstitial process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, with a left
 ventricular configuration. The aorta is minimally unfolded. There is possible
 slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is minimal
 atelectasis at both lung bases. No gross effusion. The extreme costophrenic
 angles are excluded from the film. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 There are ununited fractures of the right eighth and ninth posterior ribs,
 with slight displacement, that appears subacute or chronic.
 
 Incidental note is made of effacement of the acromial humeral interval in both
 shoulders, consistent with bilateral chronic rotator cuff tears.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Borderline cardiomegaly. Upper zone redistribution and bibasilar
 atelectasis. Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. Old right posterior rib fractures.
 3. Chronic bilateral rotator cuff tears.
