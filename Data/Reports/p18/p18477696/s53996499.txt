                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT interventional study of earlier the same date and chest
 radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small-to-moderate right apicolateral pneumothorax is new
 following the recent biopsy procedure.  Pre-existing nodules in the right
 upper lobe are again demonstrated.  The more inferiorly located, peripheral
 nodule that was biopsied demonstrates new adjacent heterogeneous lung
 opacification, possibly due to post-procedural hemorrhage.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base is new.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are
 clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small right apicolateral pneumothorax, a finding discussed by
 telephone with ___ RN at 11:40 a.m. on ___ at the
 time of discovery.
 2.  New poorly defined opacities surrounding the biopsied right upper lobe
 lung nodule, likely representing post-procedural hemorrhage at the biopsy
 site.
