                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Immunocompromised with a cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT torso of
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Again noted is a focal hazy opacity
 within the right lung apex, which is largely unchanged from at least ___.  A more rounded focus of density seen in the left low lung, projecting
 over the lateral eighth left rib, was not present on the prior study.
 Obscuration of the right heart border is felt to be secondary to a pectus
 deformity.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The heart size is normal, and the hilar structures are unremarkable.  Clips
 are seen within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe focal opacity, non-resolving, which required CT
 chest to further assess as recommended previously.
