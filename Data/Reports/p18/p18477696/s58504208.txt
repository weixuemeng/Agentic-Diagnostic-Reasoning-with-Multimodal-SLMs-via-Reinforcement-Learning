                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post right upper lobectomy for lung
 adenocarcinoma with history of post operative right hydropneumothorax, now
 presenting with with dyspnea  // eval for cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___, CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Residual right lung is better inflated following right upper lobectomy and the
 persistent apical pleural space is smaller and now nearly filled with fluid,
 overall a normal postoperative appearance. The arteries in both hila are
 mildly engorged and the heart though top normal size is larger compared with
 ___. New generalized interstitial abnormality is mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema. Greater opacification in the right lower lobe is probably a
 combination of dependent, asymmetric edema and atelectasis, but should be
 monitored after the patient's hemodynamic status improves to exclude
 concurrent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small-moderate right apical hydropneumothorax.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly, mild-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema, and
 moderate right pleural effusion. Superimposed right lower lobe pneumonia is
 not excluded.
