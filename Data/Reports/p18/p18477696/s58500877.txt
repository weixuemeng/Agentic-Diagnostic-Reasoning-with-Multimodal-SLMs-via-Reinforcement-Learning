                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:18 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man postoperative day 1 after right upper lobectomy. 
 Lung expansion failed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 10:13 p.m.
 
 A new line projecting over the right upper extremity is presumably an epidural
 infusion line, looping over the neck and descending posteriorly.  Large right
 pneumothorax and severe consolidation or atelectasis persist in the
 postoperative right lung.  Moderate right pleural effusion is enlarging, basal
 pleural drain in place.  Extent of rightward mediastinal shift is stable. 
 Left lung is clear.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends
 above the diaphragm and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all
 the side ports into the stomach.
