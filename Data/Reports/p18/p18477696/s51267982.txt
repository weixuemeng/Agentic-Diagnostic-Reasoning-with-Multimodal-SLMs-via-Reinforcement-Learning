                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  please eval for aspiration, new consolidation/pulmonary edema  //
 ___ year old man with HIV, recurrent aspiration      ___ year old man with HIV,
 recurrent aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The severe widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality disseminated
 throughout severely emphysematous lungs
 , developed since the end of ___, and has not improved over the past
 several days.
 
 The apex of the postoperative right lower lobe is the most hyperinflated
 region in severely emphysematous lungs, following upper lobectomy. The
 loculated right apical pleural effusion is chronic postoperatively.  No
 pneumothorax is present. .
 
 It would be very unusual for aspiration a lung to produce this uniform and
 widespread a change in such severe emphysema.  Aspiration could be
 contributory of course, but Instead I would consider pneumocystis pneumonia or
 severe pulmonary drug toxicity.
 
 The presence of small dependent pleural effusions is nonspecific, given the
 severity of the pulmonary abnormality.  The heart is probably normal size.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
