  Moderate mostly stable apical pneumothorax.  Lucencies at the left lateral
  base and over the left hemidiaphragm are likely due to the pneumothorax
  tracking laterally and inferiorly, which may be positional, although this is
  new from the prior exam.  There is associated compressive atelectasis.  No
  shift of the mediastinum.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumothorax after
 pacemaker placement.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval increase in the pneumothorax
 with new basal component demonstrated, substantial as well as mild increase in
 the apical component.  The position of the mediastinum did not substantially
 change and again as previously mentioned, the atrial pacemaker lead is most
 likely malpositioned.
