                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pacemaker placement,
 assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate left apical pneumothorax. 
 There is minimal right mediastinal shift.  There is basal atelectasis on the
 left.  There is mild vascular engorgement noted.  The pacemaker leads are
 noted, one of them most likely terminating in the right ventricle but the
 second one potentially can be terminating in undesirable location since its
 position is substantially to the left from expected.
