 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with question asthma flare or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate normal lung

 to transient bronchospasm.  Mild right hilar enlargement is chronic, due to
 either stable adenopathy or unilateral pulmonary artery enlargement. There is
 no pleural abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Surgical
 clips are noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute chest pathology.
