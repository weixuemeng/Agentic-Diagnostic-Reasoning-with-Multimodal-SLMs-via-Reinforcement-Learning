  lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with status epilepticus status post endotracheal and
 orogastric tube placements
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 2.2 cm from the
 carina. An orogastric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the
 stomach. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes and supine
 patient positioning. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube terminating approximately 2 cm from the carina,
 and recommend slight withdrawal.
 2. Orogastric tube in appropriate position.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
