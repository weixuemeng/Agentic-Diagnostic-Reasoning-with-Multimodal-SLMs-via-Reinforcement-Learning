                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation for possible status epilepticus.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 3.6
 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube is noted with tip in the stomach as well
 as the side port.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis.
