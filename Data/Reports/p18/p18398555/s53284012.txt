                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same
 last name!  // PNA?Bleed?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 In addition to a background interstitial abnormality, there is mild vascular
 congestion and edema.  Probable small left pleural effusion.  The right apex
 appears asymmetrically opacified relative to the left.  No or pneumothorax is
 identified.  The heart is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with moderate cardiomegaly and mild to moderate pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 2.  Asymmetric opacity in the right apex, which may represent a pneumonia or
 potentially a mass.  Recommend PA and lateral radiographs or, if the patient
 is unable to tolerate such in exam, a Chest CT for further evaluation.
