                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of HIV, hepatitis-C and IVDA presenting with fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with probable associated bibasilar
 atelectasis though early consolidation is difficult to exclude given the
 appropriate clinical circumstance. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis
 though early infection is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical
 circumstance.
