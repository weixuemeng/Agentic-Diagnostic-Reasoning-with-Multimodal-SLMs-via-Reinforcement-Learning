                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CHF  // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Patient is slightly leftward
 rotated which limits evaluation. The heart is top-normal in size. Subtle
 prominence of the left fifth anterior rib likely accounts for subtle opacity
 adjacent to left pulmonary hilum. No definite consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Clips in the upper abdomen are noted. Mediastinal
 contour is normal. Rib deformities appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute findings. Top-normal heart size.
