 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with EtOH/HBV/HCV cirrhosis with bleeding EV,
 intubated  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 14:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest film ___ 04:43 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4-5 cm above the
 carina.  Lung volumes are lower with patchy streaky opacities at both bases
 most likely reflecting atelectasis rather than pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No large effusions or pneumothoraces.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature likely related to low
 volumes.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
