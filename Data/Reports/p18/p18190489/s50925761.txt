 // ?acute process vs recurrent pneumonia      ?acute process vs recurrent
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 07:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 08:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low and there are streaky residual opacities at both
 bases, left more than right, which overall have slightly improved suggesting
 resolving atelectasis or pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax or large effusions.  Mild
 degenerative changes seen involving the right glenohumeral joint.  The left
 humeral head has a somewhat mottled appearance on the current study possibly
 related to degenerative change and patchy osteopenia due to the positioning,
 although an acute process cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.
