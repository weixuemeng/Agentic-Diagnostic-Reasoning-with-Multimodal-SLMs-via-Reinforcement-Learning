                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 9 cm from the carina, at the
 level of the thoracic inlet.  An enteric tube tip courses below the left
 hemidiaphragm, and off the inferior borders of the film.  Remainder of the
 examination is unchanged.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar. 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflective of atelectasis is present. 
 Deformity of the left ninth and tenth posterolateral ribs may again reflect
 acute or subacute rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is slightly high in positioning, terminating approximately 9
 cm from the carina, and can be slightly advanced for optimal positioning. 
 Enteric tube tip within standard position.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.
