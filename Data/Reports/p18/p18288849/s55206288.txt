 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with status epilepticus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Apart from
 minimal atelectasis in the left lung base, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal
 deformity of the left ninth and tenth posterolateral ribs may suggest acute or
 subacute rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Deformity of the left ninth and tenth
 posterolateral ribs suggestive of acute or subacute fractures, and clinical
 correlation with any tenderness in this region is recommended.
