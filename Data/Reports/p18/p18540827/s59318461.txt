                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed. Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Lung hyperinflation with increased interstitial markings are
 likely sequelae of a chronic interstitial process.  Biapical scarring is
 present.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is present. A 1.0 cm
 rounded density projects over the right apex, which may be located in a rib.
 Surgical ___, suture material, and coils are overlying the mid and left
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Chronic interstitial abnormality with no acute process.
 2. Right upper lobe nodular density. Repeat chest radiograph is recommended
 for further evaluation as this may be located within the rib.
