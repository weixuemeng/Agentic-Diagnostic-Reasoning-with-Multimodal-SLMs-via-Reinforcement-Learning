                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of central pontine myelinolysis, evaluate for right
 basilar aspiration versus pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior examination, the lungs appear somewhat better
 aerated.  Redemonstrated is hyperinflation with flattening of hemidiaphragms,
 consistent with COPD.  Also seen again is biapical scarring and increased
 prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with chronic lung disease. 
 Previously identified right upper lobe nodule is no longer seen.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Surgical ___,
 suture material, and coils are noted overlying the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Hyperinflation and increased prominence of the interstitial markings, both
 suggestive of chronic lung disease.
