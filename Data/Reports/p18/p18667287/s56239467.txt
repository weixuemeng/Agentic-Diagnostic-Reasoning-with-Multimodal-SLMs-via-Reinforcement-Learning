                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, not feeling well, evaluate for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from outside hospital from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Pacemaker with
 intact lead wire terminates in the right atrium.  The bones are intact. 
 Opacity at the left lung base is not seen on the CT from 10 days prior and is
 likely atelectasis due to low lung volumes.  Additional opacity in the right
 lung base measuring ___ x 6 mm could represent a pulmonary nodule.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1) No evidence of pneumonia.
 2) Possible nodule in the right lower lobe not seen on the abdominal CT.
 Correlate with prior imaging or repeat radiograph after the patient's acute
 process resolves. If the nodule persists, a chest CT should be considered.
