                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and right basilar opacification that
 could reflect merely atelectasis and effusion but is concerning for
 supervening pneumonia.
