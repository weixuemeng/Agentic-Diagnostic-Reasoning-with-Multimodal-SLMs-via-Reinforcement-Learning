                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, post-operative day ___, redo sternotomy,
 now history of volume overload.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___.  The patient is now extubated.  Multiple
 surgical circular wire sutures in midline indicative of redo sternotomy
 recently.  Cardiac enlargement more than pre-operatively indicating
 post-operative changes.  The pulmonary vasculature, however, is presently not
 congested indicates a significant improvement from the preceding portable
 chest examination two days ago.  Although the extensive bilateral pleural
 densities have now been reduced and now with the patient in upright position,
 mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses.  Lateral view confirms small
 amounts of pleural effusion to extend into the posterior pleural sinuses
 bilaterally. The amount of pleural effusion has now to be considered a small. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area and no new parenchymal
 infiltrates can be seen.  Previously identified right-sided PICC line again
 seen to terminate in mid portion of SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary congestive pattern, bilateral pleural
 effusions now of small amount.
