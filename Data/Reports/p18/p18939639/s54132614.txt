 is normal.  Patchy opacity is noted within the left lung base, findings which
 could reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Old right 6th rib fracture is
 present.

 Left basilar patchy opacification could reflect atelectasis though aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
