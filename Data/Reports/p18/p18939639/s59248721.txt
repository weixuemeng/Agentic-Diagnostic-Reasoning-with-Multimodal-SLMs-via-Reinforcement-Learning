                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy.  The heart is again moderately to severely enlarged. 
 The pattern of multifocal opacities is very similar to slight worse to the
 prior study, allowing for small differences in technique, particularly in the
 left upper lung, and most suggestive of vascular congestion.  Confluent
 basilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis and a moderate right-sided
 pleural effusion.  No pleural effusion is identifiable on the left.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar findings suggesting mild vascular congestion with perhaps
 slight worsening.  Similar basilar opacities and right-sided pleural effusion.
