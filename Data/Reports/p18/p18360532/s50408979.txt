                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with wekaness. Please evaluate for pulmonary edema
 and pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tortuous ascending and descending thoracic aorta alter the cardiomediastinal
 contour. Heart size is enlarged, although stable from prior examinations. The
 trachea is mildly shifted towards the right, likely secondary to enlargement
 of the aortic arch, although patient positioning is suboptimal. Lungs are
 relatively hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis. No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. No definite focal pneumonia.  There are moderate degenerative
 changes throughout both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hypoinflated lungs and mild cardiomegaly, with bibasilar atelectasis, but no
 definite pneumonia.
