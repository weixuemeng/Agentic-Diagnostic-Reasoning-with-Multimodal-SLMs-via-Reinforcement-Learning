                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low
 limiting assessment. Increased pulmonary interstitial opacities likely reflect
 mild edema. Tiny pleural effusions are likely present. Mediastinal contour is
 unchanged and prominent likely reflecting an ectatic unfolded thoracic aorta.
 Heart size is poorly assessed. Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild edema, likely bilateral small effusions. Limited exam.
