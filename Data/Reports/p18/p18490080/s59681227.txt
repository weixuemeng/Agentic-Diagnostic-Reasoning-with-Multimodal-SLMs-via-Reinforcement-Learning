                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  When reviewed in conjunction with CT of the cervical spine
 performed the same day, there is evidence of a new pleural-based opacity at
 the left lung apex overlying the lateral aspect of the left first rib for
 which dedicated, nonurgent chest CT is suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear of
 consolidation or definite effusion.  Opacity at the right lung base medially
 on the frontal view is likely due to a hiatal hernia seen on prior CT scan. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  No definite displaced fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflation without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
