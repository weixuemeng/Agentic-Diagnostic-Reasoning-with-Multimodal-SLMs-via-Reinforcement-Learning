 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___ AND CHEST CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complete opacification of left hemi thorax is consistent with previous
 pneumonectomy.  Worsening vascular engorgement in the right lung accompanied
 by perihilar and basilar opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema. Small to
 moderate right pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size, but
 positional differences between the exam is limited comparison.
