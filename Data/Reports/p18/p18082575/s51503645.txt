                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough and hemoptysis in a patient status post
 pneumonectomy for lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.
 
 The patient is status post left pneumonectomy and clips are seen in the region
 of the left hilus.  Fluid and air filled bowel loops project over the left
 hemithorax.  There is left diaphragmatic elevation or eventration, which can
 be expected post-operatively.  Contraction of the left pneumothorax and
 compensatory expansion of the right lung and minimal mediastinal shift to the
 left is expected post-operatively.  The right lung is clear without focal
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac contour could not be evaluated due to the overlying fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clear right lung and expected left post pneumonectomy changes.
