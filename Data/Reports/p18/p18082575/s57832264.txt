  ETT ends approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. A right Port-A-Cath is in
  unchanged position. Patient is status post left pneumonectomy. There is
  moderate pulmonary edema with likely small pleural effusion. Increased
  opacification of the right lung base likely reflects a combination of edema,
  effusion and atelectasis although underlying pneumonia is possible. The
  findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on
  ___ at 00:05 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent cardiac arrest  // eval for fluid
 overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___,
 read in conjunction with chest CT scan on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, most pronounced in the dependent lower lobe a of the
 solitary right lung is new since ___. ET tube in standard placement. Poor
 definition of the right bronchial tree could be due to retained secretions.
 Clinical evaluation advised. New right central venous infusion port ends in
 the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.  No right pneumothorax.  Right
 pleural effusion is small if any.
 
 Previously air has been visible in the stomach beneath the elevated left
 hemidiaphragm. A today there is no visible gastric bubble. Next could be
 because the stomach is filled with fluid, or alternatively because the
 diaphragm is depressed by an increase in fluid in the left pneumonectomy
 space. An upright chest radiograph would probably be able to distinguish
 between those possibilities.
