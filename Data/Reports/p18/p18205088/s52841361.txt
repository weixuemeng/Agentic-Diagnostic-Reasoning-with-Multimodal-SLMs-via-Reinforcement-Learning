 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ accident  // eval interval
 changes      eval interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available, but this study is
 read in conjunction with the chest CT performed on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, sparing the lung
 apices, has probably not changed since ___.  CT scan showed extensive
 acinar nodules throughout both lungs, consistent with widespread infection, or
 severe aspiration, conceivably hemorrhagic. Of note, there was also a cm size
 lung nodule and a moderate degree of central adenopathy which could be
 reactive to infection, but both raise the possibility of a preexisting
 condition, unrelated to recent trauma.  Close followup is advised.
