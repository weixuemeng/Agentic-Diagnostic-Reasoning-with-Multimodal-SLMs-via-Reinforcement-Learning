                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Septic shock and respiratory failure due to cholecystitis. Assess
 for infiltrate or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is low, approximately 2 cm from the carinal.  A new
 percutaneous drain overlies the right upper quadrant. A right internal jugular
 central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. A spinal
 stimulator is unchanged projecting over the lower thoracic spine. An enteric
 tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Note,
 the stomach is distended and filled with air.
 
 The lung volumes are low. Since the prior exam, the bibasilar atelectasis,
 bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema have all almost completely
 resolved. There is no focal opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Low position of the endotracheal tube.
 2. Interval improvement of basilar atelectasis, pleural effusions, and
 pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
 3. Air-filled distended stomach.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
