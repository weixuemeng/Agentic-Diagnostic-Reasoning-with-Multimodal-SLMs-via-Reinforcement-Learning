                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube. Evaluate placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, obtained at an outside
 hospital.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5 cm from the carina. An
 orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view.
 Since the prior exam, there is a new opacity at the right base with volume
 loss and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, most consistent with new right
 lower lobe collapse.  The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Satisfactory positioning of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube. New
 right lower lobe collapse.
