 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess infectious process in the
 chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung
 volumes are markedly low, which limits the evaluation.  Allowing for this;
 however, there is no overt consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs
 of CHF.  The heart size appears top normal, though this is likely due to
 projection and technique.  Mediastinal contour likewise is prominent though
 this also likely reflects technique.  The bony structures appear intact. 
 Degenerative spurring in the mid-to-lower thoracic spine noted.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited negative.
