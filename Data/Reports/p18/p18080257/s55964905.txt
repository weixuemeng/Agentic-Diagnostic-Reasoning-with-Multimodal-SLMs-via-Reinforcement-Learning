                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Wheezing and chest pressure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to only prior chest radiographs, ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is chronic.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is limited to the
 left upper lung.  Heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base
 accompanied by elevation of the hemidiaphragm could be atelectasis.  Although
 neither pneumonia or early cardiac decompensation is excluded by this
 examination I suspect that all the findings are chronic.
 
 Transvenous pacemaker lead can be traced to the region of the tricuspid valve
 but beyond that the course is indistinct.  There is no pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
