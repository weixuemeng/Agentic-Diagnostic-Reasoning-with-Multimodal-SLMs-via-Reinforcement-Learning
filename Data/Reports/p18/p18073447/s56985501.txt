                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain and dullness, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is within normal limits in size and there is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  There is suggestion of some increased
 opacification posteriorly at the base, though this could well merely reflect
 pulmonary vessels since the similar opacification is not appreciated on the
 frontal view.
