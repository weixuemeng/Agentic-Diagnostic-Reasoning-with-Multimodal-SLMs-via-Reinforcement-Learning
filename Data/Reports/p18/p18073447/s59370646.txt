                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart
 size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Compared to ___, there are new bilateral predominantly lower lung heterogeneous
 opacities.  Small right and likely tiny left pleural effusions are also new. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Predominantly bibasilar heterogeneous opacities with small right
 and likely tiny left pleural effusions are likely mild pulmonary edema
 although concomitant infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:21
 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
