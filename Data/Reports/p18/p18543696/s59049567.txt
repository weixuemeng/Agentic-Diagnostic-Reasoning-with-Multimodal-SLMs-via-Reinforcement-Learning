                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with Afib and B/l ___ swelling  // Pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.  Slight rightward rotation somewhat
 limits assessment.  Allowing for this, note is made of bibasilar mild
 atelectasis and probable mild interstitial edema.  Heart is top-normal in
 size.  Mediastinal contour is likely within normal limits accounting for
 rotation.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Limited exam.
