                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma h/o PE and now with acute chest
 and left back/ribcage pain and dyspnea  // eval for pneumonia, other pulm
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip projects over the mid SVC.  Lung volumes remain low and there
 are bibasilar opacities, better characterized on recent CT.  
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Persistent bibasilar opacities likely in part
 due to atelectasis given low lung volumes though underlying parenchymal
 opacities were better characterized on recent prior CT.
