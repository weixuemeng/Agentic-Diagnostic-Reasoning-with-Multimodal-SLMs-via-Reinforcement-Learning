                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, diastolic CHF, with increasing O2
 requirement.  // worsening dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right sided PICC line terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  Median
 sternotomy wires and two prosthetic cardiac valves are unchanged in position. 
 The lung volumes are extremely low. Bronchovascular markings are accentuated
 by extremely low lung volumes, but there is likely also a component of mild
 pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities that are worsening on the right side, are
 likely due to pleural effusions with adjacent compression atelectasis.
 However, cannot rule out an underlying pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Bibasilar opacities likely due to pleural effusions with atelectasis, but
 cannot exclude underlying pneumonia in these regions.
