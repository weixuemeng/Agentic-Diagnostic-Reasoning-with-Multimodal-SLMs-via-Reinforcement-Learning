 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size of a right pleural effusion with residual small to
 moderate effusion and improved aeration of the right lung. Persistent
 opacities at the right base which may reflect residual atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left lung is grossly clear. No large
 pneumothorax is seen, although there is possibly a tiny right apical
 pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. No pulmonary
 edema. Cervical spinal fusion hardware and a right shoulder arthroplasty are
 incompletely visualized
