                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, history of recent pleural
 effusion drained on right side
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion is demonstrated with right basilar opacity
 likely reflective of compressive atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess given the presence of the large right pleural effusion. The aorta
 appears tortuous. Left lung is clear. No pulmonary edema seen. No left-sided
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Cervical spinal fusion hardware
 is partially imaged as is a right shoulder arthroplasty. There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis.
