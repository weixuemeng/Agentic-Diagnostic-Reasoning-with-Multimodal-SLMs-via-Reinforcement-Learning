                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SCC  // ___ yo M with SCC of face s/p 13 hour
 case with tracheostomy, pls eval for effusion, PTX, overload ...     ___ yo M
 with SCC of face s/p 13 hour case with tracheostomy, pls eval for effusion,
 PTX, overload ...
 
 COMPARISON:  Normally prior chest radiograph, ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung is clear aside from likely small pulmonary nodules.  There is
 considerable volume loss in the left lung attributable to left lower lobe
 collapse.  Consolidation in the left upper lung could be due to pneumonia,
 particularly aspiration, or incompletely re-expanded atelectasis.  Possibility
 of unilateral right intubation during extended surgery should be considered.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Small left pleural effusion is likely.  There is no
 right pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  There may be pneumo
 mediastinum, and this should be followed with conventional radiographs. 
 Tracheostomy tube midline.  Tubing projecting over the right upper chest and
 midline cannot be localized.  Clinical correlation would be helpful.
