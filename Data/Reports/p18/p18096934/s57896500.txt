                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diffuse bilateral pneumonia, increased
 dyspnea  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are multifocal patchy airspace opacities in a similar distribution
 to the prior study, predominately in the left base.  The appearances are
 consistent with a multifocal pneumonia.  Some of the nodular opacities may
 represent metastases.  Persistent left basilar atelectasis and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  Findings
 consistent with a multifocal pneumonia, metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
