                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There has been interval removal of bilateral PICCs.  There is
 improved aeration of the left lung base, with decrease in previously seen
 consolidation.  No definite new focal consolidation is identified.  Slightly
 increased opacity in the left mid lung appears streaky and is likely related
 to atelectasis.  There is a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is
 identified.  The visualized upper abdomen demonstrates an incompletely imaged
 catheter overlying the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved aeration of the left lung base, with decrease in previously-seen
 consolidation.  No definite new focal consolidation identified, with slightly
 increased opacity in the left mid lung likely related to atelectasis.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
