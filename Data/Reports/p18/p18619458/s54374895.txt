                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Examination ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly which appears mildly
 increased in size relative to prior studies.  While this may reflect increased
 cardiomegaly, small pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged when compared to prior study dated ___. Mild vascular congestion is noted with cephalization of vessels. There
 is no pleural effusion or overt pulmonary edema. Stable rightward deviation of
 the trachea is noted. The thoracic aorta is torturous. No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly enlarged heart size could reflect cardiomegaly versus small pericardial
 effusion.  Mild vascular congestion.
