                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new oxygen requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided AICD/ pacemaker
 device is noted with leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and coronary sinus, unchanged.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Lung volumes are low
 with diffuse increased interstitial markings with reticulation, most
 pronounced along the periphery and within the lung bases bilaterally.  There
 is no pulmonary edema, new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease, previously characterized on chest CT as
 potentially due to NSIP.  No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
