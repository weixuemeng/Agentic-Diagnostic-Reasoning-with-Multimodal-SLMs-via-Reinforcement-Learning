 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube now terminates approximately 1.8 cm above the level of the
 carina, could be withdrawn by 1-2 cm.  Enteric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach.  The lungs are
 relatively hyperinflated.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.
