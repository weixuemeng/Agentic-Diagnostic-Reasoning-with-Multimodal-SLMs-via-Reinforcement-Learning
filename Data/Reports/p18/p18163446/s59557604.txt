                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS, stroke, intubated  // eval for tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.9 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the level the diaphragm, inferior aspect
 not included on the image, but side port likely at the level of the proximal
 stomach.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded. Streaky
 left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis but consolidation due
 to infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
