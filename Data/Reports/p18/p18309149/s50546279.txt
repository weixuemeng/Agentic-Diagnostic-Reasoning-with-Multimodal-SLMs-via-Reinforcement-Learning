                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided VATS decortication,
 check for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar examination of
 ___.  The previously identified residual local pleural thickenings
 and scar formations as well as mild elevation of the right-sided diaphragm
 again noted following the previously performed decortication procedure. 
 Comparison between the two examinations demonstrates further marked reduction
 of the postoperative scar formations.  Mild blunting of the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinus on the right side persists, but there is no evidence
 of any remaining free fluid.  No new abnormalities are seen.  Left-sided
 hemithorax is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further postoperative improvement.  Followup at somewhat greater
 time interval may show final resolution.
