                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS decortication, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some decrease in the
 opacification at the right base.  Chest tubes remain in place, and there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Some residual atelectasis and effusion are noted. 
 The possibility of supervening pneumonia at the right base could not be
 excluded.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear with mild atelectatic changes at the base.
 
 Subcutaneous emphysema persists along the right lateral upper abdominal wall.
