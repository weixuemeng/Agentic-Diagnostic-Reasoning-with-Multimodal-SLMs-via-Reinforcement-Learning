                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post assault with left chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema is detected.  Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes
 and therefore difficult to evaluate.  No rib fracture is detected on these
 views.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.  Sensitivity for
 rib fracture is low with routine chest radiography.  If clinical suspicion is
 high, dedicated rib series is recommended.
