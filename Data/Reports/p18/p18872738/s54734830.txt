                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 low.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is possible mild pulmonary
 edema accounting for the vague ground-glass opacities involving both lungs. 
 Alternatively, this appearance could reflect underpenetrated technique.  No
 large effusions are seen.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study with possible mild edema and mild cardiomegaly.
