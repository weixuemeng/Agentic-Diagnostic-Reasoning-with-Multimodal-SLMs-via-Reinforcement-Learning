                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Vomiting with concern for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest provided with low lung
 volumes limiting evaluation.  There is subtle opacity in the right mid-to-low
 lung which given the history of vomiting could represent a small amount of
 aspiration.  Aside from this, the lungs appear clear allowing for technique. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony
 structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung which in the
 setting of vomiting could reflect mild aspiration.
