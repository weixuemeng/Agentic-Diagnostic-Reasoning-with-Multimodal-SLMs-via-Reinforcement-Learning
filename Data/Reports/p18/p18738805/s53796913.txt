                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent bridled NGT, now pulled back 5-10 cm 
 // eval NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the available views, the radiopaque portion of the NG tube overlies
 expected location of the gastric fundus.
 
 There is left lower lobe collapse and are consolidation with obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm and diffuse vascular plethora.  There is atelectasis at
 the right lung base medially and the possibility of an early infiltrate in
 this area cannot be excluded.
 
 The right costophrenic sulcus is clear.  Possibility of a small left effusion
 cannot be excluded in this setting.
 
 The upper left lung is excluded by the patient's chin.
 
 Probable calcification of the splenic artery noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NGT tip overlying the expected site of gastric fundus.
 2. Vascular plethora is slightly worse compared with 1 day earlier, consistent
 with mild CHF.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 4. New somewhat patchy opacity at the right base medially-question
 atelectasis, though an early infiltrate could have a similar appearance. 
 Attention to this area on follow-up films is requested.
