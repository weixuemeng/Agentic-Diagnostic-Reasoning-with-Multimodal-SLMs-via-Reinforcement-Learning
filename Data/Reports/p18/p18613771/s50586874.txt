 The right mediastinal shift is unchanged as well as right apical scarring
 consistent with the prior at least partial right lower lobe lobectomy.  Lungs
 are essentially clear with no new abnormalities developing in the interim.  No
 new consolidation to suggest infectious process seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
