                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle linear right lower lung opacity, which likely
 corresponds to opacity seen on subsequent CT.  This may represent a small
 focus of atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle linear right lower lung opacity, which likely represents
 atelectasis.  Differential diagnosis includes early pneumonia and aspiration. 
 Atelectasis is non-specific, but if this finding does not resolve, then acute
 pulmonary embolism should be a consideration.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 9:15 a.m. on ___.
