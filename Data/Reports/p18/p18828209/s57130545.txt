                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with sternal pain status post known fracture. 
 Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple radiographs and CT exams dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The lungs are clear.  There is no appreciable
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  A nondisplaced sternal fracture can be seen
 without displacement or evidence for change since the initial study although
 this is not to say necessarily that it might not be healing.  Detailed
 assessment for slight change could be better assessed with CT if needed
 clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Sternal fracture without displacement or pneumothorax.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
