                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with GI bleeding
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating 5.8 cm from the
 carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach but the side port is in the
 distal esophagus, and should be advanced. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is
 top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Left internal jugular vascular
 sheath terminates in the region of the confluence of the left subclavian vein
 and internal jugular vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Enteric tube needs to be
 advanced as the side port is in the distal esophagus.
 2. Patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis but aspiration is not
 excluded.
