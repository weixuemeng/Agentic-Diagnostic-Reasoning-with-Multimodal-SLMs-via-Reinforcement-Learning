                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hyponatremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest x-ray from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are essentially clear. 
 Increased opacity over the heart on the lateral view is likely due to
 atelectasis given lack of correlative finding on the frontal view.  Prevented
 increased density in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view is likely due
 to calcific density within the left breast seen on prior CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are otherwise notable for clips over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
