                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but similar compared
 to the previous study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and
 the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the
 lung bases without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  Extensive osseous metastatic disease is re- demonstrated, better
 visualized on the previous CT chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
