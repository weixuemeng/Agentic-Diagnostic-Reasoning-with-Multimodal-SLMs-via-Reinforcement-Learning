                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, status post assault.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to reference chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are decreased lung volumes.  Volume loss with resultant increased
 opacification is seen within the left lower and right middle lobes, likely
 related representing atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  There is
 mild enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, although this may be
 exaggerated due to the AP projection and decreased lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable atelectasis at the left lower and right middle lobes.  
 
 2.  Small, left pleural effusion.
