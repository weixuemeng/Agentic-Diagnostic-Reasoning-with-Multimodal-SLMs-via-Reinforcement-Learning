 The heart is mildly enlarged, not significantly changed from prior

 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 hyperexpanded, most likely due to chronic lung disease.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar and airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 redemonstration of  compression deformities of the mid thoracic spine.  Old
 rib fractures are seen on the right. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
