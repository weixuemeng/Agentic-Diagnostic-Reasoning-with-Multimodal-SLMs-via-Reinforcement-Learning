  The distal aspect of a right-sided PICC is not as well seen as compared to the
  prior study. On this study, it appears to terminate at the proximal
  SVC/SVC-brachiocephalic junction, higher in position than on the prior, and
  appears to have migrated proximally in the interval.
  
  Since the prior study, there has been increase in bilateral perihilar and mid
  to lower lung opacities which could relate to fluid overload although
  infectious process is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new kidney failure, hypoxia  // Eval for volume
 status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The distal aspect of a right-sided PICC is not as well seen as compared to the
 prior study. On this study, it appears to terminate at the proximal
 SVC/SVC-brachiocephalic junction and appears to have migrated proximally in
 the interval. No pneumothorax is seen. Since the prior study, there has been
 increase in bilateral perihilar and mid to lower lung opacities which could
 relate to fluid overload although infectious process is not excluded. No large
 pleural effusion is seen.
