                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female postop day #2 from right thyroid lobectomy with
 extensive dissection, transection of the involved right recurrent laryngeal
 nerve.  Fevers and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 focal consolidation.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may be due
 to trace bilateral effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits given slightly low lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is identified.  Lucency projecting over the neck on the right could be
 subcutaneous gas in the setting of recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions.  No other findings to suggest acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
