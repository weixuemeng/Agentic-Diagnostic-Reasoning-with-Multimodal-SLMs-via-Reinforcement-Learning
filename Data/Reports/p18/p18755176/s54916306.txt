                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The left hilum shows a round structure in both
 views although possibly explained by vascular structures.  The lungs appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Findings which may imply left hilar lymphadenopathy.  Particularly given
 the context of known malignancy, chest CT is suggested when clinically
 appropriate, preferably with intravenous contrast if feasible.
