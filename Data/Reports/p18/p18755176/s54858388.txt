                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman recent chemotherapy here with fevers now with
 cough  // ? pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial change as compared to the previous examination has been
 demonstrated. Around structure seen in the left hilus in both views and
 potentially in the right hilus is noted and might represent lymphadenopathy
 versus parenchymal lesions. There is also a nodular opacity projecting over
 the left hilus most likely pulmonary nodule. No new consolidations to suggest
 infectious process demonstrated but correlation with chest CT is recommended
 for pre size characterization of the findings.
