                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infiltrate in a patient with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes, with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 Even allowing for low lung volumes, there is at least mild cardiomegaly. 
 Again seen is a rounded structure in the left hilus and possibly another in
 the right hilus.  These again may represent lymphadenopathy versus parenchymal
 lesions.  A 6 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left hilus is unchanged,
 may represent an end on vessel.  No new opacity or focal consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation to suggest an infectious process.
 2. Redemonstration of hilar opacities, which may represent lymphadenopathy
 versus parenchymal lesions.  Further evaluation with CT chest is again
 recommended on a non emergent, outpatient basis.
