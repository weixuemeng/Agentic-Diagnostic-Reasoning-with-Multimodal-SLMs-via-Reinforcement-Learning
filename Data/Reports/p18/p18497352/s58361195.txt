                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with sarcoid and new bibasilar crackles on lung
 exam, question parenchymal disease.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest show evidence of previous right upper lobe
 pulmonary surgery.  There is bilateral hyperinflation noted with depressed,
 flattened hemidiaphragms and blunted costophrenic angles.  No hilar
 enlargement. A posterior pleural-based mass on the right is again seen and was
 previously evident on prior chest CTs from ___ and ___ where it appeared to
 represent some fluid and rounded atelectasis.  This does not appear
 significantly different compared to ___.  No new focal
 nodularity is identified and the heart and mediastinal contours are stable as
 is positioning and appearance of the patient's left-sided pacemaker with a
 single intact lead.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No suspicious interval change from baseline hyperinflation with
 blunted costophrenic angles and in posterior pleural-based mass/rounded
 atelectasis.  No superimposed new nodularity or interstitial abnormality.
