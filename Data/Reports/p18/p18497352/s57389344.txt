                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New permanent pacemaker.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___. 
 CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new permanent pacemaker is implanted in the left upper chest.  A
 single pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle.  Chain sutures are in
 the expected location following right upper lobe wedge resection.  Right
 pleural thickening and right lower lung atelectasis is not appreciably
 changed.  A posterior pleural-based mass seen best on the lateral radiograph
 has been present since at least ___.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of permanent pacemaker with lead terminating
 in the right ventricle without evidence of pneumothorax.
