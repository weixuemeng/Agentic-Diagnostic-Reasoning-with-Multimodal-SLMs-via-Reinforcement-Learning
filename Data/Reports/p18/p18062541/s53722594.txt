 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is mildly unfolded and
 demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 imaged thoracolumbar spine. Multiple clips are again demonstrated in the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.
