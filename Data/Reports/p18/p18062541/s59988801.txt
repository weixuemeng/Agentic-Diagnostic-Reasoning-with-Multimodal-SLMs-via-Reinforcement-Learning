                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
 diabetes mellitus and obesity with new onset of atrial fibrillation and mild
 dyspnea on exertion.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is significant cardiac enlargement.  The configuration
 suggests prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and
 posteriorly.  There is also probably some mild left atrial enlargement.  The
 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated but does not demonstrate
 local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper
 zone re-distribution pattern, but no evidence of significant interstitial or
 alveolar edema is present.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free
 and there are no acute pulmonary infiltrates.  No pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  Skeletal structures demonstrate some degree of demineralization of the
 vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine as seen in the lateral view, but there
 is no evidence of any vertebral body compression fracture.  Prominent soft
 tissue structures surrounding the thorax indicative of advanced obesity.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac enlargement, mild degree of pulmonary congestion, but no
 pleural effusion or acute infiltrates in this ___-year-old female patient who
 developed atrial fibrillation.
