                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ETOH abuse, presenting with seizure. 
 Question of stroke and HSV encephalitis.  Now spiking fevers despite
 antibiotic and antiviral treatment.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new
 parenchymal opacification in the right upper lobe, which could represent an
 infectious process.  The previously demonstrated bilateral lower lung
 opacities are unchanged since the prior study.  The left PICC line now lies in
 the upper SVC, changed from prior radiograph when it was located in the lower
 SVC.  A Dobbhoff tube is seen in standard position in the stomach.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the left lung base are also
 unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  New parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe, could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Persistent bilateral lower
 lung opacifications are unchanged.  Left PICC now terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at ___, 10 minutes after the finding was discovered.
