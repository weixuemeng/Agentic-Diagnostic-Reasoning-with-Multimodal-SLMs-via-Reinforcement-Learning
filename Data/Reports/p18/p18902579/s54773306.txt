                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with with ? mediastinal widening on supine CXR  //
 eval acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Supine chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior supine radiograph performed several hours earlier,
 lung volumes have improved slightly. There has also been interval
 normalization of the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No other
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval normalization of the cardiomediastinal silhouette since the supine
 radiograph performed several hours earlier, suggesting that the apparent
 widening seen on the prior study was likely due to positioning and technique.
