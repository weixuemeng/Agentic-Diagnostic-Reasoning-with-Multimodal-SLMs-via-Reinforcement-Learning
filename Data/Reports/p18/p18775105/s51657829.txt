                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with crackles right base, hypoxia  // eval for
 pna, effusion, edema      eval for pna, effusion, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 14 55 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The dual lumen left internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position. A
 vascular stent is again seen projecting over the right upper mediastinum. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median
 sternotomy with aortic valve replacement.  The interstitium appears more
 prominent suggesting that there is now an element of superimposed interstitial
 edema.  More focal nodular opacity in the right lower lobe is felt to either
 represent a nipple shadow as no corresponding abnormality seen on the CT study
 from ___., or possibly an early infiltrate.   This can be better
 assessed on followup imaging.  No pneumothorax.
