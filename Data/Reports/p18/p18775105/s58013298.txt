                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ h/o kidney transplant and ESRD on dialysis c/b secondary
 hyperparathyroidism now s/p partial parathyroidectomy  // rule out pneumonia  
 rule out pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increased
 opacification at the left base.  In view of the lower lung volumes, this
 probably represents atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 Remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
