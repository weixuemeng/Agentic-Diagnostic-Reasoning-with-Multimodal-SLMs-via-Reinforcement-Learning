                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dizziness, dyspnea; please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a left-sided dialysis catheter with the tip
 terminating in the right atrium.  Mild cardiomegaly is overall stable compared
 to the prior exam.  Again noted is a brachiocephalic venous stent, overall
 unchanged in position compared to the prior exam.  Linear opacities in the
 retrocardiac region are likely secondary to atelectasis.  There appears to be
 a small left pleural effusion. There is diffuse mild pulmonary edema. This is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse mild pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in the
 retrocardiac region likely secondary to atelectasis.  Small left pleural
 effusion.
