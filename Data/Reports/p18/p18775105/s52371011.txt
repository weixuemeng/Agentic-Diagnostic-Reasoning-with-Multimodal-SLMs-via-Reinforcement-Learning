                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pleural effusion.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right central venous line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Left
 pleural effusion and basal atelectasis are noted, the size of the effusion is
 hard to determine, at least moderate.  There is a mild diffuse interstitial
 prominence, overall unchanged since the prior study.  The stent in the right
 brachiocephalic vein is re-demonstrated.  The patient is after aortic valve
 replacement.
