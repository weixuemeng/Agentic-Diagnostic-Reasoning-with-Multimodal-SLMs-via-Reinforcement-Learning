 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, its distal course not
 imaged.  There is again a right subclavian central venous catheter terminating
 at the cavoatrial junction.  The catheter again passes through a right
 brachiocephalic stent.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  A moderate
 interstitial abnormality has worsened including perihilar fullness suggesting
 moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no evidence for pleural
 effusion on the right.  Vague density in the left lower lung suggests patchy
 atelectasis and a very small pleural effusion is possible on of the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate, increased interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  No evidence for substantial pleural effusions.
