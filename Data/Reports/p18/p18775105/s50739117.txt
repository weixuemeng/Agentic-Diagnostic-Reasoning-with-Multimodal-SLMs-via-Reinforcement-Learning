 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with CHF exacerbation, evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are lower; this explains the increase in the heart size which is
 moderately enlarged and the crowding of bronchovascular structure at the lung
 bases.  A stent is seen in the right brachiocephalic artery.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There are no acute cardiopulmonary findings.
