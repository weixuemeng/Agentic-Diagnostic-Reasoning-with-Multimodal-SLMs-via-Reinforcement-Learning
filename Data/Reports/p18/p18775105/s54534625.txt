                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  There is mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with calcification of the aortic knob.  A
 right brachiocephalic venous stent is again demonstrated with distal aspect of
 the stent terminating in the upper SVC.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Interstitial opacities within the upper lobes persist but are
 slightly less apparent, and on the prior chest CT were thought to reflect an
 infectious process.  Additionally streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent interstitial opacities in both upper lobes, less pronounced than on
 the prior radiograph, and thought on the prior chest CT to reflect a small
 airways infectious process.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
