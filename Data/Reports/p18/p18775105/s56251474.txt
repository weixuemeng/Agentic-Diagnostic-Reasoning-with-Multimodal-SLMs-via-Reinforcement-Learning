                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 9:20
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with serratia pneumonia status post AVR.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at
 19:16.
 
 Portable AP semi-supine chest film ___ at 9:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, right subclavian PICC line and feeding tube are
 unchanged in position, although the tip of the feeding tube is not included on
 the study.  A right brachiocephalic venous stent remains in place.  The
 patient is status post median sternotomy with valve replacement and the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There has been interval
 improvement in appearance of the interstitium, suggesting a resolving
 component of edema.  There is retrocardiac opacity and more focal patchy
 opacity at the right medial lung base, both of which could reflect areas of
 atelectasis, although an infectious process should also be considered.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is
 diminished given semi-supine technique.
