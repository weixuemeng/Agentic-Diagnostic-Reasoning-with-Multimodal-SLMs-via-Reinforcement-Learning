 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress, suspected aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior radiograph there is new aeration of the left upper lung
 although there is peripheral lucency laterally that would be suspicious for
 left apical pneumothorax.  The scoliosis, extremely elevated left
 hemidiaphragm and right lung interstitial opacities are unchanged.  Close
 follow up with subsequent radiographs to exclude the possibility of
 progressive pneumothorax is recommended.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the phone by Dr. ___ at
