                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for the past three weeks, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Mild generalized bronchial cuffing is chronic.  The left
 costophrenic angle is blunted, as it has been on several prior studies,
 suggesting a very small pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits and unchanged.  Marked
 tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta is noted.  The trachea is midline.
 There is no evidence of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Bronchial
 cuffing, absent signs of heart failure suggests chronic bronchial
 inflammation.
