                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent tracheal stent placed for
 tracheobronchomalasia, now with new neck pain, dyspnea  // evidence of
 tracheal stent migration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, precise positioning of the tracheal
 stent is difficult due to positional differences of the patient and technical
 differences between the exams.  With this limitation in mind, there is  no
 gross evidence of stent migration.  CT would be more sensitive for detecting
 subtle degrees of migration and may be considered if clinical suspicion
 persists.
