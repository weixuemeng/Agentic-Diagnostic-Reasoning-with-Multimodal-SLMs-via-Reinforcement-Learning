                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post tracheoplasty, check
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Analysis performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. 
 During the interval, the previously present right-sided pleural chest tube has
 been removed.  Can now identify thickened pleural space along the right
 lateral chest wall extending into the apical area.  A pneumothorax cannot be
 identified.  There is no evidence of mediastinal shift.  Left-sided
 Port-A-Cath system and evidence of orthopedic stabilization device in lower
 cervical spine as before.  The lateral view is markedly underexposed but it
 can exclude any massive pleural effusion collecting in the posterior pleural
 sinuses.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate amount of pleural effusion in right lateral and apical
 chest area following drainage chest tube removal.  No new pulmonary
 abnormalities.
