 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains markedly enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although a pericardial effusion could also have this appearance.  There is
 some prominence of the perihilar vasculature, but no evidence of pulmonary or
 interstitial edema.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax, although the
 patient's mandible obscures the apices.  No evidence of focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
