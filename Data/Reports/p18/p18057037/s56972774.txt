                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Assessment of the apices is somewhat
 obscured by the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck projecting over
 and obscuring this region.  The heart size appears unchanged, which is within
 normal limits.  There does appear to be a left ventricular predominance.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes.  Streaky opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, and appear improved compared to
 the previous radiograph.  No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Numerous clips are demonstrated in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures
 is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with improving bibasilar atelectasis.
