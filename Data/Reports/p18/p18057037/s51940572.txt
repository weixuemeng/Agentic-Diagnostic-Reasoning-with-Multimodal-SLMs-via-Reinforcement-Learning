                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and question worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 12:34 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is new CHF, with upper zone redistribution,
 diffuse vascular blurring and areas of interstitial and alveolar edema. This
 is asymmetrically more prominent on the right, present but less pronounced on
 the left side.  There are low inspiratory volumes, but the possibility of
 bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation cannot be excluded.  The basilar
 findings are relatively similar to the prior film. Small left effusion again
 noted. 
 
 Multiple clips again incidentally noted in the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New CHF with interstitial and probable early alveolar edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion similar to
 the ___ radiograph.
