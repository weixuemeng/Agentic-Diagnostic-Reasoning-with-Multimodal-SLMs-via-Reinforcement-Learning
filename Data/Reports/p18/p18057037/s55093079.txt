                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Previous pneumonia with new fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued relatively
 low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the
 right, with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Some elevation of pulmonary
 vascularity is seen.  The left lung is essentially clear.  Given the low lung
 volumes and effusion on the right, it would be difficult to exclude
 supervening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical scenario.
 
 Of incidental note is an apparent curvilinear opacification just above the
 right humeral head, worrisome for calcific tendinosis in the rotator cuff or
 calcific deposits in the deltoid bursa.
