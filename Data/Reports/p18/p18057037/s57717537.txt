                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluation for edema, effusion and
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lung volumes are very
 low, which is only slightly worsened since ___.  This accentuates the
 cardiac silhouette which appears stably enlarged.  There is mild vascular
 congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal contour is stable;
 the pulmonary artery is enlarged.  Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities
 likely represent atelectasis.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are clips in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very low lung volumes have slightly decreased since ___. 
 Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  A
 small left pleural effusion is unchanged since ___.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is unchanged since ___.
