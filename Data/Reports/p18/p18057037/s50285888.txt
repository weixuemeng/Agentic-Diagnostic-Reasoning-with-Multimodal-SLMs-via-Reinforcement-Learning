 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Compared to the most recent prior
 chest radiograph of ___, there has been an interval decrease in lung
 volumes and interval development of bibasilar patchy airspace opacities.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present and probable trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is
 no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of left greater than right bibasilar
 opacities, possibly atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia cannot be
 excluded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.
