                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, question edema or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  There is
 increase of interstitial markings bilaterally although worse in the right
 lung, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to
 atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, worse in the right lung with bibasilar
 atelectasis. Pneumonia in the right lower lobe may be possible in the correct
 clinical setting.
