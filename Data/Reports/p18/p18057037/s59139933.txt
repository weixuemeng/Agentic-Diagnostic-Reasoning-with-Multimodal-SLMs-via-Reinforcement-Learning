                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Volume overload actively being diuresed.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: The frontal view is suboptimal. Low lung volumes
 result in bronchovascular crowding.  Pulmonary edema has resolved compared to
 the prior study, with decreased but small residual pleural effusions.  There
 is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
