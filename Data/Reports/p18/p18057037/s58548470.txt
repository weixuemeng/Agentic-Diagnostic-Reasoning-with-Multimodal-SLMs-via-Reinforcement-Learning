                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, dyspnea, crackles on exam, CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is also
 demonstrated, without overt pulmonary edema noted.  The mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded.  There appears to be a trace left pleural effusion,
 and a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are multiple clips demonstrated within the left upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis but
 infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion and possible trace
 right pleural effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema.
