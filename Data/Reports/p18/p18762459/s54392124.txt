                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result, appearing at
 least mildly enlarged.  Aorta is mildly unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Consolidative right upper lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.  Trace
 right pleural effusion is likely present.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities present.  Multiple remote left posterior rib
 fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia and trace right pleural effusion.  Followup
 radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
