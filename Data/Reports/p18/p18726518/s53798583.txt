                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate location of the known PICC and tracheostomy tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is present with the tip in the proximal trachea
 approximately 8.5 cm from the carina. A right PICC is present with the tip in
 the mid SVC. Diffuse interstitial abnormalities are consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema. A more focal opacity at the right base is of uncertain
 etiology. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. No left pleural
 effusion is identified. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is
 moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Satisfactory position of the tracheostomy tube and PICC, with the tip in
 the mid SVC.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Right basilar opacity, which may represent atelectasis or asymmetric edema.
 A superimposed infection cannot be completely excluded. Recommend a repeat
 radiograph after diuresis.
 4. Small right pleural effusion.
