 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Rule out esophageal dilatation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest were obtained.

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  Patchy
 left retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view is not replicated on the lateral
 view.  There is no acute cardiopulmonary finding.  There is no good evidence
 of esophageal dilatation.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Essentially normal study.
