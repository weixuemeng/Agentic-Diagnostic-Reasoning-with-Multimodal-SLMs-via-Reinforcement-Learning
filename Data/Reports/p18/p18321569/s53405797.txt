                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral lower extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly may suggest trace effusions. 
 Lingular linear opacity likely reflects chronic scarring.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly may suggest trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema identified.
