                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Coughs and subjective fever with chills.  History of HIV.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___; prior CT studies from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A lung nodule again projects over the
 right lower lobe, probably unchanged to the extent this can be judged from
 radiography.  On the lateral view, the superior contours of the hemidiaphragms
 are obscured by a vague opacity that is not well seen on the frontal view, but
 otherwise lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Suspicion for pneumonia based on a vague anterior inferior opacity
 depicted only on the lateral view, probably in the lingula, although
 potentially right middle lobe; atelectasis is a possible alternative
 diagnosis.  
 
 2.  Similar appearance of right basilar pulmonary nodule, although small
 changes would be difficult to detect with radiography.
