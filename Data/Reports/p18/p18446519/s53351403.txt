                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of assault with rib pain.  Please evaluate for trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT from ___.

 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is a 1.5 cm right lower lobe nodule which has been present on
 prior CT scans, most recently from ___; a formal chest CT should
 be performed to evaluate for long-term stability.  No focal consolidations
 concerning for pneumonia are identified.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite rib fractures are seen; however, a dedicated rib
 series would be helpful if there is further clinical concern for rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormalities identified.
 
 2.  No definite rib fractures are identified; however, a dedicated rib series
 may be helpful if there is further clinical concern.

 including a chest CT most recently from ___.  A formal low dose
 chest CT would be recommended to evaluate for interval stability and to
