                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Addendum:  On the lateral view, there is subtle increase in opacity projecting
 over the lower posterior chest, which is likely summation of shadows from
 vascular structures or atelectasis, however, an early infectious process, not
 identified on the frontal view, is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
