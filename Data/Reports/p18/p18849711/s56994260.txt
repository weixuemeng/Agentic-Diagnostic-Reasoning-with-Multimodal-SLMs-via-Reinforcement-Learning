                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PEA arrest x 2.  // lung hemorrhage?     
 lung hemorrhage?
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 bilaterally predominantly involving the mid an upper lungs. This could be
 associated with pulmonary hemorrhage or asymmetric pulmonary edema, though the
 possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 The cardiac silhouette is more prominent, though much of this could be due to
 the AP position and low lung volumes. If there is serious concern for
 pericardial effusion, echocardiography could be obtained.
 Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip approximately 2 cm above the
 carina.
