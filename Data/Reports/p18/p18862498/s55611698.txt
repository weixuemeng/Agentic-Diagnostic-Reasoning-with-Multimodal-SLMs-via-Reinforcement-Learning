                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 15:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with altered mental status, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 3:18.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 15:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided pacer remains in place with leads terminating over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  There is
 worsening bilateral airspace and perihilar vascular congestion, consistent
 with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There are increasing bilateral
 layering effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given differences in positioning.  Several of the superior sternal wires are
 fractured, but unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Severe degenerative
 changes are seen of an incompletely visualized left glenohumeral joint, where
 there is also flattening of the humeral head which may represent a component
 of avascular necrosis.  Clinical correlation is advised.
