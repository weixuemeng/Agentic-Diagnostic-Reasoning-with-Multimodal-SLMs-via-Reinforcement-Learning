                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pneumothoraces with chest tube on the left.  Evaluation
 for dynamics.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in severity and
 dimension of the known bilateral apical pneumothoraces.  The effusion on the
 right has minimally increased.  The atelectasis on the left has also
 increased.  Endotracheal tube and the left-sided chest tube are in constant
 position.  No signs of tension are seen.
