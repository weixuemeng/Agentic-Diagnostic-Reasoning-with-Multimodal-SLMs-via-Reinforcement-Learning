                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypopharyngeal cancer, ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 538.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7 cm above the carina. 
 If possible, the tube could be advanced by 1 to 2 cm.
 
 The known opacity at the right lung base, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia,
 is unchanged in extent and severity.  Also unchanged is the left retrocardiac
 atelectasis and a minimal left pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.
