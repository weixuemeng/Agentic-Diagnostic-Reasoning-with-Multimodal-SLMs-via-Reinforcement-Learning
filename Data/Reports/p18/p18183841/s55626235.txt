                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with stridor/hypoxia with history of
 bilateral pleural effusions with chest tube on left side and pre-existing
 pneumothorax.  Now on power ventilation with suspicion of worsening
 pneumothorax.  Evaluate pneumo.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding portable chest examination obtained during the preceding night
 with 8 hours' time interval.  Position of the ETT is unchanged, terminating in
 the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  Heart size and
 mediastinal changes have not undergone any interval alteration.  The right
 hemithorax shows well aerated lung, and the amount of pleural density on the
 right base has diminished markedly, suspicious for prominence of
 thoracocentesis during the latest interval.  The left-sided chest tube remains
 in unchanged position, and the small less than 1 cm wide apical pneumothorax
 is unchanged and has not undergone any increase which was the concern
 according to the requisition.
