                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypopharyngeal cancer with tracheostomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal
 tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac
 opacification may reflect merely volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 Fracture of the proximal humerus on the left is again seen.
