 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypopharyngeal cancer, secretions, aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette and the mild retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.  There also is
 unchanged blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left, suggesting presence
 of a small pleural effusion.  On the right, the pre-existing opacities have
 slightly decreased in extent and severity and now more concentrated in the
 medial basal parts of the right lower lung.  The location of these opacities
 suggests aspiration pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema.  The right-sided
 PICC line is constant.
