                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with probable elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Extensive retrocardiac opacification could reflect merely volume loss in the
 left lower lobe and pleural effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
