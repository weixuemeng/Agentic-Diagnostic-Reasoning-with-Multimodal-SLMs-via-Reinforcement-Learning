                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma status post chemoradiation
 and tracheostomy and PEG placement with a prior CT showing obstruction, now
 status post G-tube suctioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___; CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  Left
 lower lobe collapse with adjacent bibasilar opacities are unchanged from prior
 study.  Trach tube is in appropriate position.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  A PEG tube is seen projecting over the left upper quadrant. 
 Compared to the CT examination, there is no air in the stomach.  Therefore,
 visualization of the borders of the stomach is not possible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left lower lobe collapse and bibasilar opacities.  Borders
 of the stomach cannot be evaluated due to lack of air in the stomach.
