                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypopharyngeal SCC on chemotherapy, now
 with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates bibasilar densities,
 unchanged since previous imaging.  The left-sided pleural effusion has
 improved slightly.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no
 upper zone distribution.  There is no discrete evidence of pneumonia, but
 bibasilar densities could be contributing to the patient's clinical picture. 
 Cardiomegaly is again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged chest radiograph with persistent bibasilar
 opacities and left pleural effusion.
