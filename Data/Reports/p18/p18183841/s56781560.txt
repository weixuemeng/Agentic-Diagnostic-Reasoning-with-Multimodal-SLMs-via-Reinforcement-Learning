                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:58 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.  Pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 2:06 p.m.:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has increased.  Severe bibasilar consolidation
 is unchanged.  In addition to persistence of severe gaseous distention of the
 colon in the upper abdomen, there is new definition of the outer wall of the
 bowel, raising serious concern for pneumoperitoneum.  This examination claims
 to have been performed with the patient upright.  That needs to be confirmed. 
 I have paged Dr.___ to discuss this.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Right PIC line has been withdrawn to the
 brachiocephalic vein, several centimeters proximal to its junction with the
 left.
