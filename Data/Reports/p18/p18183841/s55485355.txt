                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of larynx cancer with increasing work
 of breathing.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate right pneumothorax and small left pneumothorax are stable. Left chest
 tube remains in place.  Mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities , a combination of large effusions and adjacent
 consolidations are unchanged.  These consolidations could be due to
 atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Right PICC tube is
 in the lower SVC.
