  Very rotated radiograph to the left.  A right-sided PICC tip is probably in
  the lower SVC.  If confirmation is needed, consider repeat imaging with better
  positioning.  Discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:24 p.m..

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Transfer from outside hospital, to confirm PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the rotated image, the tip of the right subclavian catheter is
 in the lower portion of the SVC.  Right lung is essentially clear.  On the
 left, there is basilar opacification consistent with substantial volume loss
 in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.
 
 The remainder of the left lung is difficult to evaluate due to obliquity of
 the patient.  If clinically necessary, a less obliqued view could be obtained.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  Left IJ catheter has been removed.
