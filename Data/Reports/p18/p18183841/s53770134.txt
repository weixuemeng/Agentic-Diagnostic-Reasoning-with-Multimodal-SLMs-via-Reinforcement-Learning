                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and
 pneumonia, now with concern for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with abdominal radiograph from earlier the
 same day, ___ (75 minutes prior to this exam), and chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained with the patient in
 semi-upright position.  Pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion is again
 seen, unchanged, left greater than right.  The pulmonary vasculature does not
 show signs of congestion.  The PICC line has been adjusted since previous
 imaging and now is located with the tip 2 cm above the carina.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, chest consolidation. The heart size is unchanged.  There is
 no pneumothorax or other complications noted.  As before, there is marked gas
 distention of the large bowel which raises the question of a possible
 obstruction or ileus.  Followup imaging of the abdomen should be pursued to
 further evaluate the large bowel.  There is no evidence of free abdominal air.
 The large bowel is much more distended than on previous day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked gaseous distention of the large bowel.  Recommend followup
 abdominal radiographs to assess for obstruction or ileus.  Pulmonary
 congestion and effusion is unchanged from imaging earlier today.
