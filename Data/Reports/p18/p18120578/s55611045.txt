                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers and weakness, concerning for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable supine frontal image of the chest.  There are low
 lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  There is mild to
 moderate pulmonary interstitial opacities, probably reflecting pulmonary
 edmea, but cannot rule out atypical pneumonia.  No focal consolidation or mass
 is seen.  The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted, suggestive of small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal
 in size.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial process, probably
 reflecting pulmonary edema, but atypical pneumonia may produce a similar
 radiographic pattern.  Recommend short term follow up radiographs after
 diuresis given clinical suspicion for pneumonia.
