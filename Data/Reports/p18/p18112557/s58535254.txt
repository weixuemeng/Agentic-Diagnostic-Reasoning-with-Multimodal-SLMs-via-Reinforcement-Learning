                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough, fever, and wheezing.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.  Slightly increased right lung base opacity could represent
 summation of overlapping vascular structures. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Remote right 9th rib fracture is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Slightly increased right lung base opacity, possibly representing overlapping
 vascular structures.  PA and lateral views would be helpful, if the patient is
 able to tolerate.
