                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including cardiomegaly
 and tortuous aorta.  Previously seen right lung consolidations have resolved. 
 Currently, the lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hyperinflation is better assessed on the lateral view.  The
 patient is after CABG.
