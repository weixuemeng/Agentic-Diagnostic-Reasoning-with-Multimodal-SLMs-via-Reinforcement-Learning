 INDICATION:  Status post ORIF of the right distal radius with low oxygen
 saturations.

 mid lung zone and a linear opacity in the left lower lung zone.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Multiple focal pulmonary abnormalities which are difficult to
 characterize.  Recommend further evaluation with conventional PA and lateral
 radiographs.
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or lobar collapse.
