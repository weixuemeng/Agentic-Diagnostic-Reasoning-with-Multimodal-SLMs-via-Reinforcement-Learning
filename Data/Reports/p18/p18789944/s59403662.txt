                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain with associated shortness of breath. Pain is worse
 over the left lower chest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although no rib fractures are
 identified, this study is suboptimal for the detection of rib fractures. If
 there is further clinical concern dedicated rib series should be obtained.
