                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pneumonia or congestive failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion.  This discordancy raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  No evidence of acute
 pneumonia.  Clips in the lower neck most likely related to thyroid surgery.
