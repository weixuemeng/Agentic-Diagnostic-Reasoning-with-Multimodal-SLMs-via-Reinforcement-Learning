 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Mild opacity at the left lung

 very early pneumonia.  Right lung is clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.

 Left basal opacity most likely atelectasis though difficult to exclude a very
 early pneumonia.
