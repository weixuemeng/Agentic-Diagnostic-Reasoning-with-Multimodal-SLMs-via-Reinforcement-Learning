 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the carina, feeding tube
 courses into the stomach, but its distal end is off the radiograph view.  A
 dialysis catheter through left internal jugular approach terminates
 approximately at the mid SVC and is appropriately positioned.  An aortic stent
 within the arch and proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta is
 present.  Since ___, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
 bilaterally has worsened, whereas presumed bilateral small pleural effusions
 and left lower lung atelectasis have unchanged.  Top normal heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Since ___ mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has
 worsened,  presumed small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lung
