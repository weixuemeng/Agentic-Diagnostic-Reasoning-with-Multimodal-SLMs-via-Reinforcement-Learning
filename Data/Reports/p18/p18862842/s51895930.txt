                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Type B aortic dissection, pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Nasoenteric tube with radiopaque tip (? Dobbhoff) overlies the gastric fundus.
 Right IJ line overlies the distal SVC.  Clips again noted over the right upper
 chest.
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:11 a.m., there has been very slight clearing of
 the opacity at the left lung base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.  Heart size is at upper limits of normal, with left ventricular
 configuration.  The aortic endograft and mediastinal contour is grossly
 unchanged.  The left-sided effusion persists, possibly slightly improved. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity persists.  Diffuse vascular prominence and mild
 vascular blurring is unchanged.  No gross right effusion or frank right-sided
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.
