                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post AAA repair, evaluation for pneumothorax and pigtail
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lower pigtail catheter
 is in unchanged position.  A second, newly inserted left-sided drain projects
 above the pigtail catheter that was previously in place.  A substantial part
 of the pleural fluid has been drained.  The amount of ventilated lung on the
 left has substantially increased as compared to the previous examination. 
 However, no left-sided pneumothorax is visualized.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is constant.  Minimal atelectasis in the mid right lung.  Unchanged
 right internal jugular vein catheter.  The course of the cutaneous staple
 lines is also unchanged.
