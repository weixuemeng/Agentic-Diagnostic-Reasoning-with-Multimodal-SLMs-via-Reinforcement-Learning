                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post left chest tube placement,
 check position and evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding portable chest examination of ___.  It is noted
 that a chest CT has been performed during this latest examination interval
 during the late evening of ___.  Comparison of the two portable chest
 examinations demonstrates the presence of a pigtail ending pleural drainage
 catheter that has been inserted in the lower left lateral chest wall and
 projects now with the terminating pigtail end close to the vertebral column,
 presumably located in the posterior pleural sinus.  This finding coincides
 with a marked increase of the left-sided density resulting in a practically
 complete left-sided white-out of the chest as identified on this single view
 examination.  No pneumothorax can be identified.  Position of previously
 described right internal jugular approach central venous line is unaltered and
 the degree of mediastinal shift towards the right also appears unchanged.  No
 new parenchymal abnormalities in the right hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked progression of left-sided pleural and mediastinal
 densities.  Comparison with the findings made during the chest CT examination
 concern exists that the placed pigtail drainage catheter is not effective. 
 Referring physician, ___ was paged at 1:35 p.m.
