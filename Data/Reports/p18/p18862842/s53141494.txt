                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after femoral bypass.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The
 right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  There is newly
 developed left lower lobe consolidation with left mediastinal shift,
 consistent with left lower lobe atelectasis associated with pleural effusion. 
 Minimal right basal atelectasis is also seen.  No pneumothorax is present.
