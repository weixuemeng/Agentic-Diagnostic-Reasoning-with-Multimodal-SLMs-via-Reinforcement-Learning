                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of previously seen left-sided central venous
 catheter.  Last below the aortic endograft appears to be in stable position,
 there is increased opacity between the superior edge of the endograft and the
 superior wall of the aorta at the aortic arch, which may be due to increasing
 size of aortic aneurysm and/or dissection.  CT scan is pending.  The cardiac
 silhouette is stable and top normal in size.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Right mid lung linear scarring is
 noted.
