                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post thoracic aortic graft repair with left-sided loculated
 effusion status post pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT and plain radiograph performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacification of the left hemithorax is similar, with unchanged
 mild rightward mediastinal shift.  Air bronchograms are discernable within the
 region of the left pulmonary hilus.  There is no pneumothorax.  A left pleural
 pigtail catheter is unchanged in position in the left lung base.  Right
 basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion are similar-appearing.  A right IJ
 central venous catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapid progression of left-sided opacity following pigtail
 placement is concerning for hemorrhagic fluid accumulation, and is not well
 explained by reexpansion pulmonary edema given the appearance of mass effect. 
 A repeat CT may reveal the etiology of fluid accumulation.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 2:50 p.m. by phone.
