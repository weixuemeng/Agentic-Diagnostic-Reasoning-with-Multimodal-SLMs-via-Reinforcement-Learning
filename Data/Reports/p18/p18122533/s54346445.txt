  PFI:
  1.  Tiny right and moderate left pleural effusions with small left pleural air
  collection, likely post-operative.
  2.  Improperly positioned right PICC with the tip in the right atrium
  approximately 4 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.
 PFI VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 12:02 PM
  PFI:
  1.  Tiny right and moderate left pleural effusions with a small, likely
  post-operative, now pleural air collection on the left.
  2.  Right PICC with the tip in the right atrium approximately 4 cm beyond the
  cavoatrial junction.
 PFI VERSION #2 ___ ___ ___ 1:14 PM
  PFI:
  1.  Tiny right and moderate left pleural effusions with small left pleural air
  collection, likely post-operative.
  2.  Right PICC with the tip in the right atrium approximately 4 cm beyond the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG and AVR, evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___ as well as baseline radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a moderate left pleural effusion
 with an air-fluid level suggesting a small collection of pleural air overlying
 the fluid.  There is left apical scarring which is stable since ___.  The
 post-operative cardiomediastinal widening is unchanged.  The right lung is
 clear.  The sternal cerclage wires are intact.  A right PICC sits within the
 right atrium approximately 4 cm beyond the estimated location of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tiny right and moderate left pleural effusions with small left pleural air
 collection, likely post-operative.
 2.  Improperly positioned right PICC with the tip in the right atrium
 approximately 4 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.
