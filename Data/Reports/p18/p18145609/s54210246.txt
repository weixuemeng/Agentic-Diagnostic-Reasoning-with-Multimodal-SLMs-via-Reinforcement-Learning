                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubation, status post bile duct injury.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There are persistent low lung volumes.  NG tube
 tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Multifocal opacities in the right
 upper, right lower, and left lower lobes are stable.  Multifocal lung nodular
 opacities, though less conspicuous than before are still present.  All these
 lung opacities are likely multifocal pneumonia.
