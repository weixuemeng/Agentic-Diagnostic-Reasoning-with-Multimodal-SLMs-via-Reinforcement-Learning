                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Streaky left basilar opacity, which changes
 configuration on the two views is most suggestive of atelectasis.  The lungs
 are otherwise grossly clear.  There is no large confluent consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.  There is suggestion of a
 right upper quadrant drain and catheter which are incompletely visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
