                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Basilar crackles and cough, assess for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low
 in volume with persistent right lateral basal opacity, poorly localized on the
 lateral view which is concerning for pneumonia.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings are unchanged over multiple priors and reflects a
 component of chronic interstitial lung disease.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lateral lower lung opacity remains concerning for pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
