 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 intrathoracic mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly low in volume, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular

 the upper lungs are clear.  No pleural abnormality is seen.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Repeat
 chest radiograph with improved inspiratory effort is recommended to better
 evaluate the right lower lobe.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Low lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures. Repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory effort is
 recommended for further evaluation of right lower lobe.
