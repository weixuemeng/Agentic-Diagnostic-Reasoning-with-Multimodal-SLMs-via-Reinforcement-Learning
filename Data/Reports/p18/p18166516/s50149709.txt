  There is been interval removed mid of right pigtail catheter and placement of
  right chest tube.  Two views would be helpful for better evaluation of chest
  tube positioning.  A possible second chest tube is also noted, projecting over
  the right mid lung.  There is persistent left-sided pleural effusion.  Small
  apical pneumothorax is present.  Air is seen in the subcutaneous soft tissues
  in the right and left paratracheal region ; this may be consistent with
  pneumomediastinum.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast Ca and pleural effusion s/p medical
 thoracoscopy with bx. Chest tube and pleurex in place  // evaluate tube
 placement and ptx     evaluate tube placement and ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pigtail catheter on the
 right has been removed and replaced with a right chest tube.  A second chest
 tube is seen in the right mid zone.  The apical pneumothorax has decreased,
 though there appears to be an area of loculated air collection at the right
 base laterally.
 There has been substantial increase in subcutaneous gas along the right
 lateral chest wall and especially in the right supraclavicular region.  Gas
 overlying the midline in the lower neck and upper thorax raises the
 possibility of pneumomediastinum.
 Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
