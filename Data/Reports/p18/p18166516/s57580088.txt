                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with large right effusion   s/p chest tube
 placement with 1.___mL out  // ? PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a lower right chest pigtail catheter with
 evidence of some decrease in the right pleural effusion.  Small right and
 moderate left bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Nodular opacity projects over the lateral left mid lung could
 relate to a pleural effusion and atelectasis although is not well
 characterized on this study.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 No definite pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Placement of lower right chest pigtail catheter with some decrease in size of
 right pleural effusion.  Moderate left pleural effusion persists.  Nodular
 lateral left mid lung opacity could represent combination of loculated pleural
 fluid and atelectasis, but is not well characterized on this study.
