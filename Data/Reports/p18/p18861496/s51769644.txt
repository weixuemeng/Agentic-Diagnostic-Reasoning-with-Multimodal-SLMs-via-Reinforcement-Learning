                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper lobe pneumonia, intubated.  Chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrate the ETT ending 5
 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in
 the mid SVC.  An enteric tube passes below the diaphragm with tip out of view
 at the inferior edge of the image.  Pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly is
 stable compared to the prior study.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 again noted.  The left upper lobe consolidation is perhaps slightly improved
 compared to the prior.
