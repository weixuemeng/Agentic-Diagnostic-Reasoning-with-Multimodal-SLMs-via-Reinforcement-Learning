                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and new cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear lungs, with
 normal lung volumes.  The pleural surfaces are normal.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size. The left upper pulmonary hilus appears enlarged which would
 not explain a cough and fever.  Disc degenerative changes noted at multiple
 levels along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute chest abnormality to explain the patient's presentation.
 Possible abnormality in the left superior pulmonary hilus should be
 re-evaluated in 3 months with repeat chest radiograph to include bilateral
 oblique views.
 
 The change to the original wet read of "no acute findings" was discussed with
 Dr. ___ ___ OB-GYN at 10AM by phone.
