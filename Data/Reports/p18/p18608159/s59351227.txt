                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm,
 inferior aspect not well seen on the image.  There are severe bilateral
 perihilar opacities consistent with severe pulmonary edema as well as
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is widening of the superior mediastinum
 which may be accentuated by AP, semi-erect portable technique, although if
 there is concern for mediastinal injury, chest CTA is more sensitive.  Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Severe pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum is non-specific and may be
 accentuated by technique.  However, if there is concern for acute mediastinal
 process, chest CTA is more sensitive and shoule be considered.
