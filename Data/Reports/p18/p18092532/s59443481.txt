 Moderate left pneumothorax is unchanged.  Left upper lobe opacities have
 markedly improved.  Left lower lobe opacity, a combination of lung
 consolidation and pleural effusion, is unchanged.  Right lower lobe opacities
 are stable.  The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
 Right upper lobe opacities have markedly improved.  There are mild
