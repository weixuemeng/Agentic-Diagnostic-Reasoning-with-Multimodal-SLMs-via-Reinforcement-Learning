                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Part of the lung fields are
 obscured by bilateral pacemakers.  The endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm above the
 carina.  Opacity at the left lung base may represent a small effusion and
 atelectasis or infection. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate due
 to the left lung opacity.  The upper lung zones are clear.  No large
 pneumothorax.  A nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the
 tip is not visualized, possibly in the proximal duodenum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung opacity may represent small left pleural effusion
 and atelectasis or infection.
