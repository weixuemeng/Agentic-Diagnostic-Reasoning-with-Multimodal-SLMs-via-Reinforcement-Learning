 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increased confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left
 ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged including mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  There is a mild
 interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise,
 the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Incompletely imaged lumbar fixation surgery has been performed.  Mild
 degenerative changes involve the thoracic spine.  Lower thoracic interval
 appears narrowed and irregular with sclerosis suggesting a site of more severe
 degenerative change.  Mild rightward convex curvature is centered along the
 mid thoracic spine.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, without focal
 consolidation.
