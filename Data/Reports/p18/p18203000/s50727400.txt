                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain and shortness of breath after striking left chest into a
 utility truck.  Assess for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A radiopaque skin marker is seen along the anterior seventh
 intercostal space, near the costochondral junction.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low.  The lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no definite acute rib fracture.
 Herniorrhaphy tacks are seen in the mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  No definite rib fracture, although this study is not technically adequate
 to exclude a non-displaced anterior rib fracture.  Additionally, the position
 of the skin marker indicates the patient's pain is near the costochrondral
 junction, a site which is difficult to evaluate with conventional radiography.
