                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pmhx factor 5 leidin, hx of PE's, no PE on CTA
 3 days ago, p/w worsening SOB,  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Airspace opacities are noted within the left mid and lower lung, suggestive of
 multifocal pneumonia; atelectasis due to pulmonary embolus is less likely.
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although multi focal peribronchial infiltration is more likely inflammatory,
 chronic pulmonary emboli could leave this kind of scarring.
