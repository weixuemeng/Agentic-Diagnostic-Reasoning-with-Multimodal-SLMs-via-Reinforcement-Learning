 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, epigastric pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 vague peribronchovascular opacities noted diffusely in the lungs, which could
 represent diffuse bronchopneumonia.  There is no lobar consolidation.  No
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peribronchovascular opacities which could reflect
 bronchopneumonia in the correct clinical setting. No lobar consolidation.
