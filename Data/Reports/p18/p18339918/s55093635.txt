                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of COPD and three weeks
 of cough, evaluate for infiltrates or mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is within normal limits. 
 No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened
 and elongated, but no local contour abnormalities or wall calcifications are
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or
 chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  Similar as on the preceding
 examination, relatively low positioned diaphragms are noted, demonstrating
 some flattened appearance.  This is unchanged and indicates presence of some
 COPD, but acute pulmonary infiltrates can be excluded.  No pneumothorax has
 developed in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of new acute pulmonary
 disease.
