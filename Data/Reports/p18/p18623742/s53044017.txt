                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ & ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits, and the mediastinal
 contours are unchanged and within normal limits.  There continues to be
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated basilar atelectasis,
 similar to prior exams.  Vascular congestion is also present.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued left hemidiaphragmatic elevation with left basal
 atelectasis, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.  Such a long-standing
 elevation of the hemidiaphragm raises the question of a phrenic nerve palsy or
 diaphragmatic injury.
