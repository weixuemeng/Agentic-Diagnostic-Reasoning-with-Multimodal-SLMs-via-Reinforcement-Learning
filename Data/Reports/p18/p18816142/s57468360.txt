 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the PICC line is about at
 the level of the cavoatrial junction.  The patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is again seen. There is some
 increased opacification in the left lower lung. This could well represent
 atelectatic changes, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
