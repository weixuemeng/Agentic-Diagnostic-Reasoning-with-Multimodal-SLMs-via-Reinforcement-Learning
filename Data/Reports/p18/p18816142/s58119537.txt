                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML, c/o chest pain has LL crackles  //
 eval for infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, a left PICC has been replaced or
 repositioned, now terminating in the lower superior vena cava.  Heart is upper
 limits of normal in size and lungs are remarkable for persistent bibasilar
 linear opacities but no definite new regions of consolidation.  Small
 peripheral consolidation on ___ chest radiograph has apparently
 resolved radiographically, but CT would be more sensitive for detecting
 residual subtle foci of consolidation in this region.
