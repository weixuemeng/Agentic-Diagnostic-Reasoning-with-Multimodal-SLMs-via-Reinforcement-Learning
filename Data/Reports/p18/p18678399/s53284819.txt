 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderatecardiomegaly has been stable compared to exams dated back
 to at least ___.  There is possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.   There are  bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased opacities are
 seen at the lung bases bilaterally and them inor fissure is slightly
 thickened.   No pneumothorax detetected. Please see report of ___ CT scan
 showing loculated fluid vs fat in the medastinum posteriorly -- this likely
 accounts for some of the posterior opacity seen on this exam.   Mild t-spine
 degenerative changes noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Cardiomegaly and mild chf. 
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right > left.
 3. Bibasilar increased opacities, consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 4. Posterior mediastinal mass seen on ___ CT is not well delineated on
 this exam but could account for some of the hazy density seen posteriorly.
