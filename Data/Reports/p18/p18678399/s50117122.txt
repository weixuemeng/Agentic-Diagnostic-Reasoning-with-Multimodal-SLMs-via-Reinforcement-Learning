                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Paraesophageal repair, returns with pleuritic chest pain, short of
 breath.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:57 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the degree of pleural fluid at the right base
 and degree of volume loss at the left base have both increased.  Otherwise, I
 doubt significant interval change.  Oral contrast noted in the colon, new
 since the prior study.
