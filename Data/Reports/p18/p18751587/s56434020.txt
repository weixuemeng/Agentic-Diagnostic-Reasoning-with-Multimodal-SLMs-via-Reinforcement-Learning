                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with metastatic rectal ca with L facial drrop,
 weakness x several days  // ? CVA vs bleed vs mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 and chest CT on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates over the cavoatrial junction.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Postsurgical
 changes are seen in the right hemi thorax, similar in appearance to the prior
 chest radiograph.
 
 Few, bilateral pulmonary lesions are seen and are better characterized on
 recent chest CT from ___. On the current film, note is again
 made of a previously seen nodular opacities at the right base medially, as
 well as a possible focal nodular opacity in the right upper zone, overlying
 the right fifth rib laterally at the medial border of the scapula.
 
 There is likely a small right-sided pleural effusion as well as pleural
 thickening along the inferior right chest wall and right lung base. This is
 probably associated with an area of focal irregularity of the lateral right
 eighth rib, that is consistent with metastatic disease as characterized on
 recent CT.
 
 There is no evidence of CHF, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Aside from
 minimal tenting of the left hemidiaphragm and possible minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, no significant left effusion is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Few, bilateral pulmonary lesions are seen and are better characterized on
 recent chest CT from ___.
 2. No evidence of CHF, acute pulmonary infiltrate, or pneumothorax.
 3. Pleural fluid and/or thickening at the right lung base, new or more
 pronounced compared with the ___ CT scan. This appears to be
 associated with a known metastatic lesion involving the right eighth rib. The
 possibility of a minimally displaced pathologic fracture in this location
 would be difficult to exclude.
