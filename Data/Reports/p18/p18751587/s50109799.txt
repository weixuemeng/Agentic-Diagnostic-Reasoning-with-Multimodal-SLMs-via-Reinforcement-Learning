 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper lobe wedge resection for
 metastatic rectal cancer, now with removal of a right-sided chest tube.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. 
 There has been interval removal of the right-sided chest tube.  There is
 minimal residual apical pneumothorax but there is no mediastinal shift or
 diaphragmatic flattening to suggest tension and the extent of the pneumothorax
 is unchanged compared to prior exam.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  The lungs are clear.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post chest tube removal with stable residual right apical
 pneumothorax and no evidence of tension.
