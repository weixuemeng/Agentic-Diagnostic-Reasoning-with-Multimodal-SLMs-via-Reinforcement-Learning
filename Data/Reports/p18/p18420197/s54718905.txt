                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST  RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Severe abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is again a quite elevated hemidiaphragm.  Band-like opacities in the
 right middle and lower lobes suggest atelectasis which has increased somewhat.
 The left lung remains clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated right hemidiaphragm with patchy right basilar opacity
 suggestive of atelectasis.  No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary disease or
 free air.
