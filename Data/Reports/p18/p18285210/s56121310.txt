 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 On the submitted chest radiograph the aorta is generally larger today than any
 prior chest radiographs, an the confirm cardiac configuration is different,
 more predominantly left ventricular.  Previous study showed a left humerus
 prosthesis.  This region is excluded from this examination, but I have
 concerns about the identity of this patient.  The differences could be due to
 supine positioning and therefore an upright radiograph is recommended as soon
 as feasible, to see if there is any possibility of an acute aorta syndrome.  .

 ___.
