                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, potential pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now better
 evidence of an increase in radiodensity in the middle and basal parts of the
 left lung.  The overall opacities are relatively subtle, but diffuse and show
 a micronodular and reticulonodular pattern.  A similar but smaller area of
 opacity is seen at the right lung base.  If consistent with the clinical
 presentation, pneumonia would be the first differential diagnosis.  The size
 of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions are seen.
