                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  Minimal linear opacities in both lung bases likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Please note that the extreme right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the field of view.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
