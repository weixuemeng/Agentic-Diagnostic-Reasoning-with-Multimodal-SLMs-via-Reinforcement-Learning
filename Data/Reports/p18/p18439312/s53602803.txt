                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cardiac arrest status post extubation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.  There is better aeration of the lungs with improved bibasilar
 atelectasis, improved vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  If any, there is a small left effusion.
