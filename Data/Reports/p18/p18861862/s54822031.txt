                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Female with positive PPD in the past.  Assess for tuberculosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Hyperlucency of the left lung is secondary to technical error (off
 center anode placement). Calcified granuloma projects over the left hilus with
 rounded homogeneous calcified opacity, best assessed on lateral may represent
 lymph node or nodule.  No additional focal opacity, pneumothorax, pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila otherwise
 normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Calcified granuloma with adjacent rounded calcified opacity that may
 represent lymph node or lung nodule.  Consider anterior oblique views for
 further characterization with a review by a radiologist to see if additional
 views are necessary such as oblique lateral.
 2.  No radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis.
