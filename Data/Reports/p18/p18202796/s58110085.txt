                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, intubated after cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube projects 4.2 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular
 central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric
 tube is subdiaphragmatic.  There is diffuse opacification of bilateral lungs
 with a perihilar predominance but also extensively extending into the upper
 and lower lung zones.  Scattered air bronchograms are also noted.  Accounting
 for changes related to technique and positioning, heart is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contour is notable for venous engorgement and extensive aortic
 calcifications.  Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriate positioning of lines and tubes.
 
 2.  Severe diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema and small to moderate bilateral
 effusions.
