                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, here with large hematoma, some tachypnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Cardiac silhouette size
 appears within normal limits.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vascular
 markings towards the apices likely reflective of underlying emphysema. 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study.  Streaky atelectasis within the lung bases.  Emphysema.
