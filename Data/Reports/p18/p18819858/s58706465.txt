                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subdural hematoma, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.  There is
 some overlying motion artifact on the lateral view which makes that projection
 suboptimal.  The radiographic technique on the frontal projection is
 suboptimal as well.  However, given these limitations, the patient is status
 post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and CABG with stable
 post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is improved aeration
 with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  Two
 surgical clips are seen overlying the right lower axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
