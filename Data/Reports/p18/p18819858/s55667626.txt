  Lung volumes are low. There are increased bibasilar opacities, left greater
  than right, which are likely representative of atelectasis or aspiration;

  clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially
 lower lung volumes.  Areas of increased opacification are seen at both bases,
 although most likely atelectasis, the possibility of aspiration or overlying
 infectious process would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
