  Again noted are low lung volumes and bibasilar opacities with minimal
  improvement in aeration of the left lung base and perhaps slight worsening of
  the right lung base. These opacities are again most likely representative of
  atelectasis but overlying infectious/aspiration must be excluded in the proper
  clinical setting.
