                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:18 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer, admitted for acute hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There has been marked acceleration of the extent of consolidative abnormality
 in the right lung since ___, mild improvement on the left which has been
 more severely affected since ___.  No way to exclude concurrent
 pneumonia, but I suspect that the findings in both lungs are predominantly
 rapid progression of lung cancer.
