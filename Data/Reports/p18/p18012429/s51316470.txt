                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath. Evaluate for evidence
 of consolidation or pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent on ___. Chest
 CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax is of
 increasing density since the recent prior CT.  A large area of opacity in the
 inferior segment of the right upper lobe as well as more patchy right middle
 lobe involvement were better assessed in recent chest CT from ___
 and similar in appearance allowing for difference in techniques.  Widespread
 opacification of the left mid to lower lung is increasingly dense, however. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Similar extensive alveolar opacities in the inferior segment of
 the right upper lobe and right middle lobe as well as increased confluent
 opacification of the left mid to lower lung.
 
 The overall appearance suggests severe worsening multifocal pneumonia
 superimposed on known malignancy.
