 improved areation of the left lung. There seems to be an increased area of
 opacity in the right lung base which could represent dissemination of known
 adenocarcinoma. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, an underlying
 infectious process is also possible. There is no definite pneumothorax. The
 heart cannot be evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased density at the right lung base which could represent
 increased disseminated adenocarcinoma. However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, an underlying infectious process is also possible.
