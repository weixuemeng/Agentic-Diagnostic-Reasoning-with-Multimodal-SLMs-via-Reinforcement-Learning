                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Low grade fever in patient with known lung cancer.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___, chest CT ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Extensive consolidation in the left
 upper lobe and left lower lobe are unchanged consistent with patient's known
 cancer.  Right upper lobe and right lower lobe opacities have increased. 
 These could be due to worsening malignancy or worsening pneumonia.  Right
 lower lobe lung nodule is better seen in prior CT.  Left lower lobe opacities
 have mildly improved.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
