                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left upper lobe BAC, status post TBBx, rule
 out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be near opacification of the left lung, likely
 secondary to patient's known malignancy.  The extent of the patient's
 malignancy is better seen on the prior CT from ___.  The right
 lung also demonstrates nodules that are better evaluated on the prior CT.
 There is a focal opacity along the right minor fissure, which did not have a
 CT correlate, and may be a focal consolidative process, however malignancy
 cannot be ruled out.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal. 
 The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. No post-procedural pneumothorax.
 
 2. Right upper lobe infiltrate abutting the minor fissure without a definite
 prior CT correlate. This may be secondary to an infectious process, however
 malignancy cannot be ruled out.
 
 3. Right lung nodules better evaluated on prior CT.
