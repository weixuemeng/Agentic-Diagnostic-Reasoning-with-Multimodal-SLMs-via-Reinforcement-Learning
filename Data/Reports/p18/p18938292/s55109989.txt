                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior kidney transplant, now with cough and fever, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  There are mild streaks at the left base most likely representing
 atelectasis or fibrosis.  No convincing evidence of acute pneumonia or
 vascular congestion.  
 
 Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again seen.
