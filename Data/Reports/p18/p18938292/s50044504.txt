                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Renal transplant with pyelonephritis now with persistent fevers and
 dyspnea.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low, which results in vascular crowding and
 apparent enlargement of the normal-sized heart.  Streaky opacities in the left
 lower lobe.  The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with streaky opacity in the left lung base which
 is likely atelectasis, although, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
