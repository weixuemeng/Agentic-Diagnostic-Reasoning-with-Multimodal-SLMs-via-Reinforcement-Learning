                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cough for a week.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Region of abnormality which on the frontal view projects over the right mid
 lung above and below the level of the minor fissure, is new since ___.  It
 could all be due to pneumonia in the superior segment of the right lower lobe,
 projecting over the spine on the lateral view.  There may also be elements in
 the anterior segment of the upper lobe, and the lower pole of the hilus may be
 enlarged.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no evidence of adenopathy
 elsewhere, nor any pleural abnormality.  Heart size is normal.  Even if
 patient continues to improve, I would recommend followup chest radiographs in
 four to six weeks to document clearing and absolve the right hilus.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 10:54 a.m., one minute following recognition of
 radiographic findings, and we discussed them at 10:55A.M.
