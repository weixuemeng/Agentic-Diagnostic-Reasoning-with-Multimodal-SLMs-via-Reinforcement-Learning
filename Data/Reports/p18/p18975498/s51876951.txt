 recurrent pneumothorax  // evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac size is top-normal.  Left PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction. 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities, multiple cavitary septic pulmonary emboli and
 pneumonia, larger in the right lower lobe, have improved on the right.  Small
 bilateral effusions greater on the right are probably unchanged allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Small left lateral pneumothorax is
 stable.  .
