 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 20:42.
 
 Previous large left pneumothorax has been evacuated.  Left Left apical pleural
 drainage catheter in place.  Combination of mild pulmonary edema and
 multifocal cavitary septic pulmonary emboli, most pronounced in the right
 lower lung, and small right pleural effusions not appreciably changed.  Heart
 size normal ET tube and nasogastric tube in standard placements, and intended
 left internal jugular line, are all unchanged in their respective positions.
 
 Because of the somewhat unusual course of the central venous line, I suggested
 to the covering resident that the line be checked to make sure that it is
 placed appropriately in a central vein, not a small vein or artery.
