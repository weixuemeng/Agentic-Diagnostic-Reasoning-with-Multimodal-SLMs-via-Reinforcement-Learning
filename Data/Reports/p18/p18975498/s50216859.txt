                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TVR  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph extensive ___.
 CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Right middle lobe cavitation and right
 upper, middle, and lower lobe focal opacities are stable.  Improved trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  The distal tip of a left PICC
 terminates in the region of the the superior cavoatrial junction.  Intact
 sternotomy wires and tricuspid valve replacement are unchanged.  Medial
 displacement of the gastric bubble suggests splenomegaly seen on prior CT
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Stable right middle lobe cavitations and right upper, middle, and lower
 lobe focal opacities consistent with history of septic emboli.
