                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MSSA endocarditis with bilateral chest
 tubes  // evaluate chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left chest tube has slightly changed in orientation, but appears
 appropriate.  Unchanged positioning of all other lines and tubes.
 
 A cavitary lesion is seen within the right mid lung, better characterized on
 the recent CT.  The opacification at the lung left base has worsened,
 representing a combination of pleural fluid and parenchymal opacification. 
 The opacification at the right base has also slightly progressed.  Cardiac
 size is difficult to evaluate.  No pneumothorax is visualized on today's
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of all lines and tubes.
 2. Cavitary lesion within the right midlung, better characterized on the
 recent CT, along with other lesions.
 3. Increasing bibasilar opacification representing a combination of
 parenchymal consolidations and pleural fluid.
 4. No pneumothorax seen.
