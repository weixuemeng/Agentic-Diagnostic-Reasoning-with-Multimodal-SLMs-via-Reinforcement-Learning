                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hypertension and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is moderately tortuous and, along
 the arch, calcified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Effacement
 of the right posterior lateral costophrenic angle suggests a small
 diaphragmatic hernia. The lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderately tortuous aorta. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
