                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent community-acquired pneumonia with persistent hypoxia
 and leukocytosis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Small right and moderate left pleural effusions are probably unchanged
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar
 consolidations, larger on the left side, could be due to atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema.
