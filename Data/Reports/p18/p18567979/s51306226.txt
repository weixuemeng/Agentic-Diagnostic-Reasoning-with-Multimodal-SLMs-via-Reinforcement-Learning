                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with remote breast cancer, admitted for multifocal pneumonia
 complicated by CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion and
 bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left with associated
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia,
 though this could well be hidden in the retrocardiac region on this single
 frontal view.
