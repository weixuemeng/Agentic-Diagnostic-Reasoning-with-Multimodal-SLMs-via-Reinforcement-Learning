 PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a left-sided PICC line with tip at cavoatrial junction.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for technique. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis, slightly improved bilaterally in the setting
 of slightly improved inspiratory volumes.  Upper zone redistribution, without
 definite CHF.  No gross consolidation or effusion.  Extreme right costophrenic
 angle excluded by the device outside the patient.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis again seen, slightly improved.  No definite aspiration
 pneumonitis.  No no frank focal consolidation.
 
 Possible minimal upper zone zone redistribution, without overt CHF
