                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleural effusion, elevated INR, worsening
 hypotension  // presence of worsening hemothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large opacity projecting over the left mid to lower hemi thorax is again seen,
 worrisome for pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 edema is again seen. Increased patchy right basilar opacity may be due to
 atelectasis or aspiration given short term development. Difficult to exclude a
 small right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged although not
 well assessed on the left due to the large left-sided opacity.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left mid to lower hemi thorax opacity raises concern for large pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. Previously
 seen midline shift has a decreased in the interval. Mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema. Interval increase in right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis or
 aspiration given short term interval development.
