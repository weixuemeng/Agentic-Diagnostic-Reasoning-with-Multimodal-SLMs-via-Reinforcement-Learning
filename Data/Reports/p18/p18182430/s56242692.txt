                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New large left-sided pleural effusion. Heart size cannot be reliably assessed
 but there is at least moderate cardiomegaly. Calcifications of the aortic
 knob. Left hilar contour cannot be evaluated.  Right hilar contour is not well
 evaluated.  There may be mass effect from a large pleural effusion with
 rightward mediastinal shift.  Lungs demonstrate pulmonary vascular congestion
 and mild edema.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.  Severe degenerative
 changes of bilateral glenohumeral joints are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large left-sided pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema.  Infection
 cannot be excluded in this context. There is prominent cardiomegaly, though
 the cardiac contours are partially obscured by the effusion.
