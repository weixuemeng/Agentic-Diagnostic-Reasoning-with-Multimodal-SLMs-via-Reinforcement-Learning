                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe AS and diastolic heart failure with
 worsening O2 sats.  // Pulmonary edema vs. infiltrate     Pulmonary edema vs.
 infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now no obliquity of the
 patient.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild to
 moderate vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of
 the hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe
 with small pleural he fusion.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be difficult to definitely exclude an infiltrate at the left
 base, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
