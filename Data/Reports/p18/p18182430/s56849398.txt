                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of chronic diastolic heart failure,
 admitted for new diagnosis of DM. Rule out pneumonia.  // please eval for pna,
 pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation and parenchymal distortion consistent with COPD. 
 Also again seen is marked cardiomegaly with prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery and a calcified, slightly unfolded aorta.  Probable mitral annulus
 calcifications.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular
 plethora, without overt CHF.  Possible minimal blunting of left costophrenic
 angle, less than on ___.  No focal consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified.
 
 Severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis this is seen bilaterally.  Marked deformity
 of the humeral head raises the question of humeral head osteonecrosis in both
 shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
 2. Marked cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 3. Mild vascular plethora, less pronounced than in ___.
 4. No focal opacity to suggest an acute pneumonic infiltrate on this AP view.
 5. Interval improvement in small left effusion, with residual minimal blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle.
 6. Severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis bilaterally.  Possibility of bilateral
 humeral head osteonecrosis cannot be excluded.
