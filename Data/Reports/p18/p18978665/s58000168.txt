 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with rapid atrial fibrillation and
 weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a hyperdense nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base that
 may represent a bone island in a rib vs. a calcified granuloma in the lung. 
 The lungs and pleural spaces are otherwise clear without evidence of
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The heart is normal in size.  There is no
 evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Osseous structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
