                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/MDS and ___ bacteremia  // signs of pneumonia,
 consolidations, interval changes      signs of pneumonia, consolidations,
 interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right subclavian PICC line is been
 removed.  Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  There is some fullness of pulmonary vessels that could
 reflect crowding related to the low lung volumes or possibly mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite acute focal pneumonia, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting this would be difficult to unequivocally exclude,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
