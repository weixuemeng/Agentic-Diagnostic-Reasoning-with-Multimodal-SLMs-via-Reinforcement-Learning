                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Correlation is made to chest portion of shunt series from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are
 noted.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen.  There is no effusion and
 superiorly the lungs are unchanged.  There is a relatively stable 8 mm nodule
 projecting over the right upper lung laterally.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Shunt catheter projecting over the right side of
 the mediastinum, although not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities which could potentially
 be due to atelectasis.
