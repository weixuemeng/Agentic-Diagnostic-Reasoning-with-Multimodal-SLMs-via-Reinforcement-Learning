 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.  Feeding
 tube ends in the upper stomach.
 
 Conventional radiographic appearance has not improved since ___
 ___.  Concurrent chest CT scanning showed much more extensive
 abnormality than appreciated on chest radiographs.  Findings included
 multifocal peribronchovascular infiltration as well as small nodules some
 cavitated and even smaller bronchiolar nodulation.  For example the left
 perihilar lesions visible on the frontal view and the largest cavity, in the
 right middle lobe, seen on the lateral are no smaller.  There is no pleural
 effusion or consolidation.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Overall findings suggest fungal infection and perhaps a second pathogen, such
 as mycobacterial species, including m. tuberculosis.
