                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A retrocardiac opacity is seen which
 is likely due to atelectasis although infection is hard to exclude.  Given the
 linear shape of the opacity, atelectasis is perhaps more likely.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, likely due to atelectasis but possibly due
 to pneumonia in the appropriate setting.
