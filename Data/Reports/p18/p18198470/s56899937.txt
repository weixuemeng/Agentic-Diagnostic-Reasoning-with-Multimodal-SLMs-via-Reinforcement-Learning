 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with epigastric and left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The trachea is deviated to the left above the thoracic
 inlet, raising the possibility of right-sided thyroid enlargement.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Leftward deviation of the
 trachea above the thoracic inlet raises possibility of right-sided thyroid
 enlargement.  Consider evaluation with ultrasound.
