                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malignant pleural effusion.  Question change in left pleural
 effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is dense opacification in the right upper zone, similar or slightly less
 than on the film from ___ at 18:57 p.m.  There is a small effusion at the
 left base, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Compared to the
 prior film, the degree of left base opacification, including the amount of
 left pleural fluid, appears to have decreased somewhat and there is less
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax is detected on either
 side.  The left upper lung is grossly clear.  Aside from some coarsening of
 the interstitial markings on the right, the right lung and right lung base are
 grossly clear.  There is a small right effusion, which appears new or larger
 and there is a more straightened appearance to the right cardiophrenic portion
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  The left heart border remains partially obscured.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, slightly
 improved, with less elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion is more apparent on today's study, with less
 delineation of the right cardiophrenic sulcus, of uncertain etiology or
 significance.
 
 3.  Continued right upper zone opacity, ? slightly improved versus less
 prominent due to differences in angulation.
