                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with renal cell cancer,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The known involvement of the lungs by multiple masses in the right upper lobe,
 left upper lobe, with subsequent atelectasis of the left upper lobe due to
 obstructing mass and slight left mediastinal shift as well as left lower lobe
 nodules are better appreciated on the CT torso from ___.  Within
 the limitations of the comparison, the impression is that there is interval
 improvement of the bulk of lymphadenopathy in the left perihilar area with
 some subsequent improvement of the left upper lobe atelectasis.  The right
 upper lobe nodules are unchanged.
 
 There is new/increased peripheral nodule in the left mid lung zone that
 potentially might reflect nodule in the left upper lobe, better appreciated
 now after reexpansion of the lung.  There is normal position of the
 mediastinum with no previously seen left mediastinal shift available.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
