                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic RCC. Stent in the bronchus intermedius, with a new
 stent in the left main bronchus, to check the position of the stent and
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large heterogeneous mass in the region of the right
 upper lobe and the left perihilar region, consistent with known metastatic
 disease.  A stent is positioned within the left main bronchus and right
 bronchus intermedius.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  In comparison to
 the prior study, there is moderate reduction of the left lung volume, with a
 new small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right bronchus intermedius and left main bronchial stents are in place. 
 New reduction of the left lung volume since ___ with a new left pleural
 effusion.
 
 2.  Extensive right upper lobe and left perihilar masses consistent with known
 metastatic disease.
