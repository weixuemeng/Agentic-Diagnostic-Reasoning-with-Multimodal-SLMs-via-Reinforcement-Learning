                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea with a history of malignant pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right upper lobe collapse upper lung zone around a central tumor is
 longstanding; less severe left upper lobe atelectasis has been variable.  The
 lung volumes are low.  Persistent, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right, are somewhat larger.  Small multifocal lung metastases are
 better characterized on the recent CT.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes and effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent right upper lobe collapse and less severe left upper lobe
 atelectasis around central tumors.
 2.  Bilateral large pleural effusions have slightly increased in size since
 the prior exam.
 3.  No new consolidation to suggest a new pneumonia.
 4.  Numerous small lung metastases.
