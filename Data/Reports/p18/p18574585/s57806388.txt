 AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.  Low lung volumes. Right upper lobe collapse
 around the central tumor is unchanged.  Again seen is the left mid lung mass.
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are unchanged. 
 Previously seen small multifocal lung metastases are better characterized on
 previous CT.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well evaluated.

 tumor.  Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
 right.  Left mid lung mass again seen.
