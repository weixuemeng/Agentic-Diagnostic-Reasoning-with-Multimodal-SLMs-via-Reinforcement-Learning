                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left IJ line.  Evaluate line placement,
 question pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to prior from
 ___. New left IJ line is seen with tip in proximal SVC.  Previously
 identified left PICC line is no longer visualized.  There is no visualized
 pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are again seen, left greater than right,
 potentially worsening since prior exam even taking into account differences in
 positioning and technique.  Upper lungs remain clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left IJ line with tip in the proximal SVC.  No visualized
 pneumothorax.  Potential progression of the left greater than right opacities
 suggestive of effusions with underlying airspace disease not excluded.
