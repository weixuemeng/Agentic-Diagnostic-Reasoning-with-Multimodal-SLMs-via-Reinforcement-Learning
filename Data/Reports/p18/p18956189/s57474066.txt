                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nephrotic syndrome, on dialysis, septic shock.  Question interval
 change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 vascular plethora, consistent with mild fluid overload.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A small left effusion is present.  The extreme right
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross right effusion is
 present.  
 
 A left IJ central line is present, tip overlying mid SVC. Irregular density
 overlying left upper quadrant appears to represent oral contrast or less
 likely something outside the patient. A plate and screws transfixes an
 ununited left proximal humeral diaphysis fracture.
 
 Compared with ___ at 14:03 p.m., there may have been slight interval
 clearing at the right base.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
