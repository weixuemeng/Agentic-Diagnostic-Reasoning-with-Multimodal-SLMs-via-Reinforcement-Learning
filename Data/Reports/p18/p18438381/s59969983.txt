 There are bilateral opacities, projecting over the right infrahilar border and
 left lung base.  Evaluation on the lateral view is slightly limited due to
 dense sclerotic bones.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Osseous
 structures are diffusely mottled and sclerotic, consistent with known
 metastases.

 1. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
 2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Diffuse sclerotic metastases.
