                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pneumo.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:50.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  On the frontal view,
 there appears to be slight increase in opacity at the left lung base,
 difficult to evaluate on the lateral view due to the patient's overlapping
 arm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increased opacity at the left lung base may be artifactual;
 however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Lateral view with the
 patient's arm not overlapping would be helpful for further evaluation.
 
 2.  No definite pneumothorax seen; please note that the questionable sliver of
 pneumothorax seen on CT cervical spine would be difficult to appreciate on
 radiography.
