                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male off ventilator, treated for post-obstructive
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC terminates in the upper SVC.  Linear right basilar
 opacities could reflect atelectasis. True extent of right hilar mass is better
 assessed on the prior CT and underestimated on this single radiograph.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present without pneumothorax.  The heart is
 normal in size.
