                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, status post hip surgery one week ago.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph of the chest was obtained.  As before, the
 patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are slightly
 low. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary
 edema is present. New heterogeneous opacities at the left lung base are some
 combination of atelectasis, and small effusion, though infection is not
 excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax. Left
 sided rib deformities appear chronic. Left PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacities at the left lung base could be
 atelectasis with a small effusion, though infection cannot be excluded. No
 pulmonary edema.
