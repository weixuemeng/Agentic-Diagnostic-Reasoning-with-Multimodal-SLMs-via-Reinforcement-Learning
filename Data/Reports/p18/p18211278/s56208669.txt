 subsequent images, the tip is within the upper portion of the stomach. The
 nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with poor definition of the

 right hemidiaphragm is now sharp.  Given the time course, this most likely
 reflects ___ more upright position of the patient rather than complete clearing
 of the layering effusion.
