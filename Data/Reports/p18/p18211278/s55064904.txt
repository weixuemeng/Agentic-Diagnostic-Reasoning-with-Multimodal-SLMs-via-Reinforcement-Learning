 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:02 PM
  No new focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified. Left-sided
  PICC line has been retracted in the interim, with the tip either folded back
  on itself or terminating in azygos vein, and must be repositioned. Findings
  were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9p on the day of the exam by phone.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complicated hospital course, now spiking fevers, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 A left-sided PIC line is present, the tip is somewhat curled overlying the
 upper SVC.  A nasointestinal tube is present - a portion of this is coiled
 over the expected site of the fundus, while the tip extends beneath the
 diaphragm off the film.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  In
 this setting, a subtle basilar infiltrate or focus of aspiration would be
 difficult to exclude. Even so, compared to ___, there has been interval
 improvement in the left base opacification, with renewed visualization of the
 left hemidiaphragm. No CHF or effusion.  However, the minor fissure on the
 right is again seen.  Slight asymmetry in the density of both lungs is noted,
 though this may be an artifact of rotated positioning. The cardiac silhouette
 unchanged, with evidence for left ventricular enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Low inspiratory volumes, wity bibasilar atelectasis.   Interval improvement
 in the left base opacification. Otherwise, no definite new pulmonary process,
 though subtle basilar infiltrates would be difficult to exclude.  
 
 2) Curled appearance of the tip of the left-sided picc line. Consider
 repositining, as described in the previous wet reading.
