                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and dyspnea.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest shows prominent
 apical lucencies and cystic spaces compatible with chronic emphysema.  Right
 infrahilar opacity likely represents a summation of normal vasculature.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  The aorta is
 heavily calcified and tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Emphysema. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
