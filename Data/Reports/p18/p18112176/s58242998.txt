 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intractable seizures and large aa gradient

 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung
 volumes remain relatively low, with bilateral layering pleural effusions, left
 more than right and subsequent areas of left more than right atelectasis. 
 There is no evidence for a newly appeared parenchymal opacity that would
 suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  The monitoring and support devices are
 constant
