                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman who is intubated with leukocytosis  // new
 focal opacity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased opacification of
 the right base which likely represents pneumonia. The left lung is essentially
 clear. There is a probable small right-sided pleural effusion. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 The tracheostomy tube ends 2 cm from the carina. Right-sided PICC ends in the
 distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the right base likely represents pneumonia.
