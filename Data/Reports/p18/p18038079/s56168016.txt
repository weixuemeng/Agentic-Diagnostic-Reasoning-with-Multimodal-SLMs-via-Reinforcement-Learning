                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AS, IPF, with dyspnea. Fluid balance
 positive // ?volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ to ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Recent CT demonstrated severe septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis,
 suggesting background fibrotic disease. These background bilateral fibrotic
 changes, worse on the right with loss of right lung volume and elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm and rightward shift of the mediastinum are overall
 unchanged and better seen on CT dated ___. However, day-to-day changes in
 consolidation suggests at least some component of superimposed edema. 
 Pulmonary edema has also progressed from the most recent exam, now
 moderate-to-severe. The heart size is also increased, now moderately enlarged.
 Pulmonary vessels appear more prominent.  Probable left greater than right
 pleural effusion.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, overall
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac decompensation on background fibrotic disease.
