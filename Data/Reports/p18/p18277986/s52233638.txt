 HISTORY:  Right hip fracture, preoperative chest radiographs.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal images of the chest.  There is a retrocardiac opacity, which could
 represent atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right
 clinical setting.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal size was
 otherwise unremarkable.  The trachea is noted to be slightly deviated to the
 left at the level of the thyroid, suggestive of a right sided thyroid goiter. 
 Bony destruction is noted in the head of the right humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity, which could represent atelectasis but cannot exclude a
 pneumonia or aspiration right clinical setting.
