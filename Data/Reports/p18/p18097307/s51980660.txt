                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema, increasing dyspnea and PND.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:29 p.m.
 
 Compared with the prior from and allowing for technical differences, there is
 slight increase in the degree of opacity at both lung bases.  Otherwise, no
 significant interval change is detected.  Again seen is upper zone
 redistribution, cardiomegaly, and bibasilar patchy opacities, which could
 reflect pneumonia or aspiration.  Small bilateral effusions are also present. 
 Suspect background COPD.  The pulmonary hila appear prominent, with suggestion
 of a tapered appearance, which could reflect pulmonary hypertension.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities again seen. These could reflect penumonia or
 aspiration. Differential diagnosis could include an atypical distribution of
 CHF at the bases, but this is considered less likely.
