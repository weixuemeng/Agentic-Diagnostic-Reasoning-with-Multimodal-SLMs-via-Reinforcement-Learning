 HISTORY:  Elevated troponin, bilateral lower extremity edema, elevated BNP and
 shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
 calcifications of the aortic knob.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is noted.  Additionally, patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect aspiration or infection, and less likely
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect pneumonia, aspiration, and
 less likely atelectasis.
