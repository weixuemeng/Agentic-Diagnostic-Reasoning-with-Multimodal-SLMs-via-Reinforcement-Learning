 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There are
 bilateral lower lung linear opacities most likely representing atelectasis or
 scarring.  Multiple old right rib deformities are noted.  The heart and
 mediastinal contour are grossly unremarkable allowing for an unfolded tortuous
 thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
