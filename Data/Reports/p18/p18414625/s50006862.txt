                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post left lower lobe lobectomy presenting with
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to chest CT from ___ and prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post left upper lobectomy with associated left lung volume loss and
 shift of the mediastinum to the left.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 including posteriorly suggests a small pleural effusion.  There is also slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests trace pleural fluid.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions appear increased compared to
 prior.  Left upper lobectomy changes including left lung volume loss.
