                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post left upper lobectomy,
 check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  There is status post left-sided upper lobectomy with commensurate
 mild degree of volume reduction of the left hemithorax.  There remains some
 blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus, but there is no evidence of
 residual pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior sinus as identified on
 the lateral view.  The on previous examination identified left-sided chest
 wall emphysema has disappeared completely.  Right hemithorax remains
 unremarkable as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory postoperative findings with mild volume loss of
 left-sided hemithorax and pleural basal scar formations but no evidence of
 remaining fluid.
