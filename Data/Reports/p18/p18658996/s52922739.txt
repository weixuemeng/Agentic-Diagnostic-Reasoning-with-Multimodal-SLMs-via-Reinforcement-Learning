                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with retroperitoneal bleed, now with new NG tube.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  New nasogastric tube
 terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, which is elevated.  Diffuse opacities
 overlying both lungs has increased since ___.  Opacity overlying
 the left base is compatible with a moderate to large pleural effusion with
 probable underlying consolidation.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 persists, compatible with a moderate pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly may be exaggerated by patient rotation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New NG tube terminates below the diaphragm.
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion, now moderate to large, with probable
 underlying left base consolidation.  Moderate right pleural effusion persists.
