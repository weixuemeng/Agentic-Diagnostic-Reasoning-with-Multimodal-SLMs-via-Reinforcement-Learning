                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusions and hypoxia and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube has been exchanged and can be followed to the
 diaphragmatic inlet where it may terminate possibly in the distal esophagus. 
 There is a large left-sided pleural effusion.  Allowing for suspected
 differences in orientation, there is no definite change in its size.  There is
 similar mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures and a moderate pleural
 effusion is probably unchanged on the right.  Opacification appears increased
 in the left lower lung with new total opacification of the superior segment,
 in addition to a substantial suspected pleural effusion and  consolidation or
 atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification of the left lower hemithorax reflecting
 a persistent moderate-to-large pleural effusion and suspected consolidation or
 atelectasis involving the lingula and left lower lobe, now involving the
 superior segment.
