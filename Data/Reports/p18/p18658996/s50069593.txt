                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left thoracentesis for a large effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:01.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A new left basilar chest tube is demonstrated with interval decrease in size
 of the left pleural effusion, now moderate in extent.  There is a persistent
 layering pleural effusion on the right which is moderate in size.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 No definite pneumothorax is present.  Nasogastric tube tip terminates at the
 distal esophagus, and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion, now moderate in
 extent with left basilar chest tube in place.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2. Persistent moderate right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar patchy opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
 
 3. Nasogastric tube tip is suboptimally position, terminating within the
 distal esophagus, and should be advanced.
