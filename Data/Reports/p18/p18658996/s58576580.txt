                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with retroperitoneal bleed and congestive heart
 failure, intubated for supraventricular tachycardia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  New endotracheal tube
 terminates 6.8 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube is in similar position to
 prior, below the diaphragm, with the side port in the area of the GE junction.
 Right lower lung atelectasis is similar to prior.  Diffuse opacities overlying
 both lungs are similar to ___ and remain consistent with moderate
 right and large left pleural effusions.  Potential lung abnormality underlying
 the effusions cannot be assessed on this view.  Moderate cardiomegaly and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the carina.  
 2.  NG tube may be advanced by 5 cm for position within the stomach.
 2.  Stable appearance of large left and moderate right pleural effusions.  The
 underlying lung would be better assessed in upright or reverse Trendelenburg
 position.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on
 ___ at ___ PM.
