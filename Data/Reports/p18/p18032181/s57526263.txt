                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Upper back pain after fall, pleuritic pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is a
 moderate left pneumothorax.  Lucency along the left mediastinum/pericardial
 region could be due to the pneumothorax; however, a pneumomediastinum is not
 excluded.  There is no shift of the mediastinum.  Left-sided rib interspaces
 appear widened as compared to the right, although this could relate to
 patient's scoliosis.  Otherwise, the lungs are hyperinflated.  There is left
 base atelectasis, small left pleural effusion not excluded.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is
 a minimally displaced fracture of the posterolateral left sixth rib.  Mild
 bi-apical pleural thickening is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left pneumothorax.  No mediastinal shift; however, the left-sided
 rib interspaces are wide as compared to the right side and while this could
 relate to patient's scoliosis, tension is not excluded.  Lucency along the
 left heart border and left mediastinum may relate to pneumothorax, although
 pneumomediastinum can have the same appearance.
 2.  Left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, although a small left pleural
 effusion is not excluded.
 3.  Minimally displaced left posterolateral sixth rib fracture.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:55 p.m. on
 ___, 6 minutes after discovery.
