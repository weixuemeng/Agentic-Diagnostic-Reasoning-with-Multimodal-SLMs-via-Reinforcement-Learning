                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increased shortness of breath.  Rule out acute
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Low lung volumes are
 seen.  There is, however, diffusely indistinct pulmonary vascular markings
 seen bilaterally without frank confluent consolidation nor effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings
 throughout which could potentially be to extremely low lung volumes, however,
 atypical infection or edema may have a similar appearance.  If desired, repeat
 with better inspiratory effort on the frontal exam suggested.
