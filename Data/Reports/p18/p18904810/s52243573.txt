                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:37 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ITP after splenectomy.  Increasing shortness
 of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and mild pulmonary edema has
 developed, but most striking is the increase in size of the cardiac silhouette
 and mediastinum at the level of the vascular pedicle.  This raises serious
 concern for either biventricular heart failure or developing pericardial
 effusion leading to tamponade.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:30, at the time findings were recognized.
