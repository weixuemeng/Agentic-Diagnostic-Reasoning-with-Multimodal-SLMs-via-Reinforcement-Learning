                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe abdominal pain.  Evaluation for
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  The ascending shadow appears more
 prominent on this study compared to prior examination, possibly due to
 differences in imaging technique. There is air within the fundus of the
 stomach; however, no subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent interval increased prominence of the aortic shadow since
 the prior study may be entirely projectional due to differences in imaging
 technique. However, follow-up routine PA and lateral radiographs are
 recommended for further characterization.
