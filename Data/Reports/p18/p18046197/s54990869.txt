                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of left upper chest
 tenderness to palpation after fall, evaluate rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly-enlarged.  Slight obscuration of
 the right heart border on the frontal view, not seen on the lateral view, may
 be due to atelectasis.  No displaced fracture seen.  However, if clinical
 concern for rib fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more
 sensitive.
