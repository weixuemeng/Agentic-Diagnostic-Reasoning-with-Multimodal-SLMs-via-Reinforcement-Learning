 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right subclavian PICC
 line tip is in the region of the mid portion of the SVC.  Relatively low lung
 volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of

 effusion.
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum is consistent with lipomatosis as shown
 on the CT study of ___.
