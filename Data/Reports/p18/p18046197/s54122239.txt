                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pressure and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm obscuring the upper-to-mid
 thorax.  Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with stable widening of the mediastinum, compatible
 with mediastinal lipomatosis as seen on prior CT, including ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
