 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.

 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been no
 significant change.  The heart is large.  There is mediastinal lipomatosis as
 seen on prior chest CTA examination.  Lung volumes are decreased.  However, a
 focal consolidation cannot be definitely excluded.

 Limited evaluation due to patient's body habitus.  As such, a definite focal
 consolidation cannot be definitely excluded and conventional chest radiographs
 are recommended for complete evaluation.
