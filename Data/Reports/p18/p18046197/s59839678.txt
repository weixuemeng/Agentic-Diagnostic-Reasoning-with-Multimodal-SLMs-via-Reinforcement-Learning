 HISTORY:  Upper abdominal pain after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged due to prominent
 epicardial fat pads.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged, and stably widened
 compatible with mediastinal lipomatosis.  Hilar contours are normal.  Lungs
 are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Pleural thickening is
 noted bilaterally due to pleural fat deposition.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
