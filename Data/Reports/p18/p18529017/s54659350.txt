                                 FINAL REPORT
 ADDENDUM:
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, recent URI, now AFib.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle on the frontal view, not well substantiated on the
 lateral view, may be due to pleural thickening or a very trace pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle on the frontal view, not well substantiated on the lateral view, of
 indeterminate age, could be due to mild pleural thickening, although a trace
 pleural effusion is not excluded.
