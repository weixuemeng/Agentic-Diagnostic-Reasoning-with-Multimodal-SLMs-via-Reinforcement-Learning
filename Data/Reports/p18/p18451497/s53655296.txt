                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Patchy and
 linear opacities are present in the mid and lower lungs, most confluent in the
 left retrocardiac area.  Overall, lung volumes are increased compared to the
 prior study and overall aeration of the lungs is generally improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy and linear mid and lower lung opacities favoring
 atelectasis.  Followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude focal pneumonia
 in left lower lobe.
