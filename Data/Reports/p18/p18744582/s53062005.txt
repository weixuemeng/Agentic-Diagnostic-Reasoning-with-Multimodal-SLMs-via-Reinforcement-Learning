                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Migraine, sensory, reflex changes, question pneumonia or other
 illnesses.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  The heart is not enlarged.  Minimal prominence of the
 ascending aorta noted.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.  
 ?slight left convex scoliosis centered at T4/5, which could account forslight
 thoracic asymmetry, with the left clavicle and left breast shadow lying higher
 than the right.  Minimal degenerative spurring in the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) No focal consolidation detected to suggest pneumonia.
 2) Minimal prominence of the ascending aorta noted - in the absence of
 hypertension, this may be an artifact due to mild scoliosis.
