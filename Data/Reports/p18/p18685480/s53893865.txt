                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lower cervical pain and tachcyardia 2 wk sp
 MVC.  // Evalaute for acute injury, acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected. No CHF,
 focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
   In the mid thoracic spine, there is suggestion of severe disk space
 narrowing at the T7-9 levels with very subtle right convex curvature in this
 region. No obvious vertebral body compression is detected. No
 spondylolisthesis is seen. The sternum is partially obscured on the lateral
 view by overlying soft tissues, but is grossly unremarkable.
 
 The sternoclavicular joints are minimally asymmetric, though this may relate
 to slight scoliotic curvature.
 
 Incidental note is made of piercings in both breasts.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute pulmonary process identified.
 2. Focal disc space narrowing in the thoracic spine, at T7-9, with probable
 subtle right convex curvature at that level.
