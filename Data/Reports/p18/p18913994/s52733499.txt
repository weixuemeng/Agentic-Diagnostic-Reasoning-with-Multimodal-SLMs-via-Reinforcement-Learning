                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval pneumo
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph from several hr earlier, a
 previously identified small right apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized,
 possibly due to semi upright positioning.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 slight worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and persistence of very small
 pleural effusions, left greater than right.
