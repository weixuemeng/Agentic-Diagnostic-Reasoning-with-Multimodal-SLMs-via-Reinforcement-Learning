                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with small cell lung cancer presenting with
 dyspnea. Evaluate for mass, pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. Correlation made to chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of an accessed right pectoral MediPort projects over the low SVC.
 There is no pneumothorax. Prominent bilateral interstitial lung markings
 likely correspond in part to the patient's known severe emphysema. However,
 increased prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to
 superimposed edema or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial changes of emphysema with increased interstitial
 opacities, which may be due to superimposed infection or edema.
