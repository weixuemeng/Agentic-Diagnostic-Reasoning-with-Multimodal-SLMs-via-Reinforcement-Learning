                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsy, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no evidence of
 post-procedure pneumothorax.  The area of increased opacification in the right
 upper zone is somewhat more prominent, raising the possibility of some
 bleeding related to the procedure.  Otherwise, little overall change.
