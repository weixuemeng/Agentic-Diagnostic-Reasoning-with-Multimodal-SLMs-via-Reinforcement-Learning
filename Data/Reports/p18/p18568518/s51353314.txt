                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated which slightly limits assessment. Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC. Cardiomediastinal contours appear
 grossly unchanged allowing for patient rotation, with the heart size within
 normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The lungs are
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes re- demonstrated at the lung apices.
 Slight prominence of the interstitial markings at the lung bases appears
 relatively unchanged. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Emphysema.
