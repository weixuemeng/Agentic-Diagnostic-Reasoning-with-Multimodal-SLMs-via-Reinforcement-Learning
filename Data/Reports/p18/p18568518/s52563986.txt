 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SCLC and fevers/ fatigue.  // ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the large RO mediastinal and hilar
 masses have overall substantially decreased in size. The lung volumes,
 however, have also decreased, causing crowding of the vascular and bronchial
 structures, notably at the lung bases. In addition, there is a new
 retrocardiac atelectasis as well as an overall increase in vascular diameters,
 likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema.  WET READ was delivered at the time of
 image acquisition.
