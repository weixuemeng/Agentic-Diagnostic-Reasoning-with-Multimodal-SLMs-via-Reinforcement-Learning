 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with prostate carcinoma.  Evaluate for

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  The overall heart size is within normal
 limits.  No configurational abnormality is present.  The thoracic aorta is
 generally moderately widened and elongated, but there are no local contour
 abnormalities and the findings are stable in comparison with the previous
 examination of ___.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No
 signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No
 pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  In comparison
