                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:22 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with ALL and stem cell transplant complicated by
 graft-versus-host disease, now on photopheresis with influenza and left lower
 lobe pneumonia.  New pain at the pheresis catheter site.  Has the catheter
 migrated?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Given the difference in patient position, migration of the right jugular line
 that ends behind the head of the right clavicle is less than a centimeter.
 
 Generalized increase in peribronchial opacification affects both lungs but is
 most pronounced on the left where there are new regions of involvement
 suggesting progressive pneumonia.  Heart is top normal size and azygos venous
 distention suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume, but the
 asymmetry of the pulmonary findings suggests that they are not due to
 pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 dictation.
