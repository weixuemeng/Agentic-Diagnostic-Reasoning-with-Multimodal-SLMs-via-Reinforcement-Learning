 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior radiographs, there is little change. Large
 layering right pleural effusion, severe pulmonary edema, and moderate
 cardiomegaly are unchanged. There may be slight improvement in left-sided
 opacities, compatible with either edema or atelectasis, although superimposed
 consolidation cannot be ruled out. A left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 removed.  A right subclavian central venous catheter tip ends in the right
 atrium, and a left IJ introduction sheath ends at the level of the left
 brachiocephalic vein. Endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina and the
 enteric tube and side port end within a decompressed stomach. The right
 basilar pleural drain is in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. All lines and tubes in standard position.
 2. No pneumothorax.
 3. Persistent large layering right pleural effusion and severe pulmonary
 edema.
