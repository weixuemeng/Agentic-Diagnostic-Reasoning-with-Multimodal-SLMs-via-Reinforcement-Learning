                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new dobhoff placement, evaluate dobhoff
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple frontal view radiographs of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sequential images demonstrate placement of a Dobhoff tube, which initially
 extends into the right mainstem bronchus, is subsequently withdrawn, and is
 then readvanced, likely still terminating in the proximal right mainstem
 bronchus.  A right PICC is unchanged terminating in the low SVC.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  A
 right lower lobe pulmonary nodule corresponds to a granuloma on prior chest
 CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Sequential images demonstrating attempted Dobhoff placement, likely still
 terminating in the proximal right mainstem bronchus.
