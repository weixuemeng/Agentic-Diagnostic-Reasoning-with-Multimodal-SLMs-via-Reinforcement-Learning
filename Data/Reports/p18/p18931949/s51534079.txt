                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, evaluate for interval change, volume
 overload?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral atelectasis. 
 Allowing for this there is likely mild central pulmonary vascular congestion,
 similar to the prior study without overt pulmonary edema. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  A right PICC terminates in the low SVC.  A 3 mm right lower lung
 nodule corresponds to a granuloma seen on recent chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged mild central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary
 edema.
