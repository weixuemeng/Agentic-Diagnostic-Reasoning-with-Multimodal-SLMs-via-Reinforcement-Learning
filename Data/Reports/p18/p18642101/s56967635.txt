                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post anterior mediastinotomy and
 pericardial window.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.  
 
 A new pericardial drain overlies the heart.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged due to known underlying large pericardial effusion but the
 apparent left ventricular border is less rounded than on ___,
 compatible with a slight interval decrease in pericardial effusion.  The
 azygous vein is also substantially smaller.
 
 7.6-cm mass projecting over the right hilum represents the patient's known
 large anterior mediastinal mass.  The indistinct left costophrenic angle is
 compatible with a small pleural effusion, which was present on ___.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Status post pericardial window with slight interval decrease in
 pericardial effusion.
 2.  Large anterior mediastinal mass and small left pleural effusion, similar
 to prior.
