                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decompensated liver cirrhosis and recent GI bleeding,
 now with increasing tachypnea.
 
 Suspected pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  There is interval
 development of right upper lobe large area of consolidation, consistent most
 likely with atelectasis, but infectious process cannot be excluded.  The rest
 of the pulmonary opacities are unchanged as well as substantially elevated
 right hemidiaphragm most likely due to the presence of ascites.  No
 pneumothorax.  Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
