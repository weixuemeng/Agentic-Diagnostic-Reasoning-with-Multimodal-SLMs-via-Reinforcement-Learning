 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, nasogastric tube placement assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, nasogastric tube has been
 advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The tube appears to be securely located.
 
 The low lung volumes persist.  On the partially imaged lung parenchyma, there
 is a slight increase of pre-existing parenchymal opacities on the right.  The
 left parenchymal opacities that pre-existed also appear to increase. 
 Unchanged position of the endotracheal tube.  Unchanged borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
