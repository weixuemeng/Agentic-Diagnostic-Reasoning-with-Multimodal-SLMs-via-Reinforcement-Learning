                                 FINAL REPORT
  
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is slightly low with the endotracheal tube 2.4 cm above
 the carina.  Lung volumes are very low, with areas of increased opacity in the
 left lung and right lower lobe.  Given the patchy appearance of these,
 infection is likely.  Right hemidiaphragm continues to be moderately elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy areas of bilateral opacity worrisome for infection.
