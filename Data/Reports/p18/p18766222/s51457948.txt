                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with NG tube, evaluate placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison can be made to the next preceding chest
 examination of ___.
 
 During the interval, an NG tube has been placed seen to pass well below the
 diaphragm.  The distal portion of the line continues through the stomach,
 passes the area of the pylorus and apparently points in caudal position and
 the mid portion of the duodenum.  The side port of the line is at the site of
 the pyorus.  Pulmonary findings have not changed.  A rather remarkable
 right-sided elevated diaphragm is noted, finding which existed on yesterday's
 examination as well.  No evidence of new acute infiltrates and no signs of
 pneumothorax.
