                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Pacemaker for MRI.  // Patient has a
 pacemaker and is awaiting an MRI. Please evaluate pacemaker and leads.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with chest radiograph on ___, a right chest wall
 biventricular pacemaker defibrillator generator is stable in position, with
 right ventricular pacer defibrillator, and left ventricular pacer leads in
 standard position.  The right atrial pacer lead appears more medial than
 typically seen, however is stable from priors.  There has been interval
 decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion compared with prior.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Left chest
 port is unchanged, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right chest wall biventricular pacemaker defibrillator has leads terminating
 in right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle.  The right atrial pacer
 lead appears more medial than is typically seen, however is stable from
 priors.
