  Interval removal on left-sided chest tube.  No pneumothorax.  Increased
  retrocardiac opacification.  Also slightly more dense opacification in the
  left upper lung.  Findings may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude an
  effusion or infectious process. ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial and status post MVR and CT removal.  Rule out pneumothorax. 
 Preliminary report typed into PACS reads "interval removal of left-sided chest
 tube.  No pneumothorax.  Increased retrocardiac opacification.  Also slightly
 more dense opacification in left upper lung.  Findings may represent
 atelectasis, but cannot exclude an effusion or infectious process.  ___
 ___."
 
 FINDINGS:  A semi-upright portable chest radiograph shows sternal hardware
 status post mitral valve replacement with the radiodense portion of the
 prosthetic valve visible.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is in place at the level of
 the main pulmonary artery, directed slightly to the right.  There appears to
 be more obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm than seen on yesterday's study
 where subsegmental atelectasis is suggested and there is new or increased
 streaky consolidation in the left upper lung zone, very slight consolidation
 in the right costophrenic angle.  Endotracheal tube and chest tube seen on
 yesterday's study has been removed and no pneumothorax is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Recommend lateral view with followup to evaluate increasing consolidation
 at left lung base.
 2.  No visible pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
