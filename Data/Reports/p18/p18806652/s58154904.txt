                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with pain, history of COPD, evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Aortic arch calcifications are
 re- demonstrated.  The hila are unremarkable.  Diffuse interstitial prominence
 and bronchial wall thickening is again seen.  In the right upper lobe, there
 is multifocal interstitial opacity better evaluated on prior chest CT from
 ___, likely relating to the mixed solid and ground-glass nodules seen on
 that study.  Pleural parenchymal scarring is seen in the lung apices.  There
 is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pulmonary venous congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right upper lobe interstitial opacities are better evaluated on prior CT,
 correlating to mixed solid and ground-glass nodules seen on that study. 
 Follow-up chest CT is recommended to document stability.
 2. Diffuse interstitial abnormality, mild bronchial wall thickening, and
 hyperinflation is consistent with COPD.
 3. No focal lung consolidation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendation above regarding follow-up
 chest CT were discussed with ___, Medical Student by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 1:09 PM, 15 minutes after
