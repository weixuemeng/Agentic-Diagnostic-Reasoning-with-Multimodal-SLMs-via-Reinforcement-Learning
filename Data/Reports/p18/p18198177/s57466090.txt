                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Complex rounded mass in left lower lobe posteriorly is associated
 with multiple cystic lucencies inferiorly, and a persistent crescenteric
 lucency surrounding the majority of the lesion.  As compared to the prior
 study, multicystic basilar component of the lesion demonstrates increasing
 extent of air-fluid levels, and there may be an adjacent new area of
 consolidation laterally.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased extent of air-fluid levels within multicystic component
 of left lower lobe sequestration, concerning for complication by infection
 and/or hemorrhage.  Consider a chest CTA for more complete evaluation as
 entered in the radiology communications dashboard on the date of the study.
