 HISTORY:  Cough, history of pulmonary sequestration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___, and
 a CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A rounded left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is seen again, essentially
 unchanged in size and morphology as compared to the most recent examination;
 it is predominantly cystic/solid with small crescents of gas. A small left
 pleural effusion is unchanged. The remainder of the lungs are essentially
 clear without focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The
 heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Unchanged left lower lobe pulmonary sequestration and small left pleural
 effusion or pleural thickening.
