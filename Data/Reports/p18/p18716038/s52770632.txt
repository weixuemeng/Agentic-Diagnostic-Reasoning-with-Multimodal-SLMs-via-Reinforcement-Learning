                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier same day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post left PCNL with increased O2
 requirement.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided with patient
 positioned upright.  Evaluation is markedly limited due to underpenetrated
 technique more so on the lateral view.  There is consolidation in the left
 lower lobe, which could represent aspiration or pneumonia.  This finding is
 more conspicuous compared with prior exam.  Lung volumes are low.  The imaged
 portion of the right lung appears clear.  The heart and mediastinal contour
 appear grossly stable.  No large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with low lung volumes.  Increased conspicuity of
 consolidation in the left lower lobe, question pneumonia versus aspiration.
