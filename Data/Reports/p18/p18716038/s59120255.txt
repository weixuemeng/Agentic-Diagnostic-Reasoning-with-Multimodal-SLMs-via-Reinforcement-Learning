                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post PCNL, post-op day 3 with hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  There is persistent left pleural
 effusion which appears small to moderate but slightly decreased as compared to
 the prior study.  Left base retrocardiac opacity is most likely due to
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The right lung is grossly
 clear.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion which may be slightly improved.  Possible
 very trace right pleural effusion.
