                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from chest CT performed on ___ and earlier
 radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, inserted via a
 right-sided approach.  An extensive opacity in the left upper lung is quite
 similar.  A large cavitary component within the central part of left upper
 lobe consolidation appears unchanged.  A left-sided pleural effusion appears
 likely decreased.  However, the main change is that there is new patchy
 opacity in the left lower lobe with upward tenting of the left hemidiaphragm
 and volume loss.  A mild-to-moderate lower thoracic compression deformity is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent extensive left upper lobe consolidation including a
 large cavitary component.  Although a left-sided pleural effusion is probably
 reduced, there is increasing parenchymal opacification with volume loss at the
 left base, which may be associated with increased extent of infection. 
 Clinical correlation is suggested.
