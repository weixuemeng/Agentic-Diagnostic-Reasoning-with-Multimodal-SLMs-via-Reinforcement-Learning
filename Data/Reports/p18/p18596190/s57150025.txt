                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man after intubation.  Evaluate ETT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated in the interim with the ETT tip approximately 4
 cm from the carina, in standard position.  The right internal jugular venous
 catheter tip projects over the expected region of the upper SVC.  Since the
 prior exam, bilateral parenchymal airspace opacities have worsened,
 particularly in the right lung which could be edema and/or infection.  Several
 areas of more nodular parenchymal opacities particularly in the right lung as
 well as the left lower lung are concerning for concurrent multifocal
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is enlarged.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  An
 enteric tube traverses the hemidiaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its
 tip is not visualized but the side port is within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT in standard position.
 2.  Rapid interval progression of bilateral parenchymal opacities in the last
 couple of hours suggests a component of edema as well as multifocal pneumonia.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
