                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with variceal bleeding, evaluate for
 progression.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The internal jugular introducer sheath and nasogastric tube are likely
 unchanged in position.  Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2.5 cm
 above the carina.
 
 2.  Improving aeration with interval resolution of the patchy left basilar
 opacity consistent with resolved atelectasis.  Persistent linear opacity at
 the right base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged
 given portable technique and positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Increasing
 opacity at the right apex may be related to differences in positioning given
 the patient's marked rotation to the right on the current examination,
 although an evolving air space process or upper lobe atelectasis cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Followup imaging would be advised.
