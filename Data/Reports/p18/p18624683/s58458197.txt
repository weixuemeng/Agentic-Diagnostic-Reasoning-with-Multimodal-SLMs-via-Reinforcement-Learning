                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:02
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cirrhosis and possible variceal bleed;
 check ET tube position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:54.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 4:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm.  The right internal jugular introducer
 sheath remains unchanged in position, although on the current examination, it
 appears that distally there is a smaller caliber catheter.  When speaking with
 the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 9:47 a.m., no additional line
 has been placed and therefore this likely reflects artifact.  
 
 2. There still is a persistent right apical opacity.  Bibasilar patchy
 opacities, right greater than left, most likely reflect patchy atelectasis
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 essentially stable.
