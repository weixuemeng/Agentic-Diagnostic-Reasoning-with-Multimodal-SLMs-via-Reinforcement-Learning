                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Two radiographs were obtained, one at 11:56 a.m. and one at 12:00
 p.m. The second radiograph demonstrates repositioning of the PICC, which is no
 longer coiled and terminates in the lower SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:
 ___ year old man with recent PICC placement  // please eval for interval change
 in PICC line
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 From the PICC line.  Has extended slightly further into the superior vena cava
 but still curls back on itself by 2.6 cm.  It could be that a power flush
 would be helpful for better placement.  There continues to be dense
 retrocardiac opacity.  Lung volumes are low on the right but the aeration is
 slightly better than earlier the same day.  The ET tube is unchanged
