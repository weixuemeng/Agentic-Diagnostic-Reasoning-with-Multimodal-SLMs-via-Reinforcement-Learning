 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low compared to the prior examination.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  
 Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Basilar opacities likely relate
 to atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is likely due to
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
