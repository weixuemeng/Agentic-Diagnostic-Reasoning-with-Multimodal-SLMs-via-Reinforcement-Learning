 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis and rising bilirubin.  Cough with
 phlegm.  Roommate had influenza.
 
 PRELIMINARY REPORT:  "Low lung volumes.  No lobar consolidation.  Right lung
 base opacities are more conspicuous since ___, which may represent
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting." ___
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show clear lungs with no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Mild prominence of the ascending thoracic
 aorta is unchanged and cardiac silhouette and central pulmonary vasculature
 are within normal limits.  There is some straightening of usual thoracic
 kyphosis with no focal bony lesion seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No suspicious interval change and no pneumonia.
