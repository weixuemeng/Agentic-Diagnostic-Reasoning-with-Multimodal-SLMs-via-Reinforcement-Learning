                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  In
 the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a right
 basilar opacity felt to most likely represent pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis though underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Dedicated PA and
 lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able. 
 Aside from minimal left basilar atelectasis, the left lung is clear.  No
 evidence of left-sided pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of right basilar opacity, which may be due
 to pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis versus consolidation.  Dedicated
 PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient
 able.
