                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain with a history of cirrhosis and ascites.  Evaluate
 for an acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, resulting
 in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
 
 There is a paucity of bowel gas.  Surgical material is seen in the right upper
 quadrant.
