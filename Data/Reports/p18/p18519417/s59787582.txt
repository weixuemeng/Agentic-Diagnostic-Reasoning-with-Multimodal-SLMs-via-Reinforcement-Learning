                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Liver failure, shortness of breath, tachycardia, abdominal
 distention, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable upright chest radiograph provided.  Lung volumes
 are low with bronchovascular crowding at the lung bases.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basal opacity likely represents atelectasis versus
 bronchovascular crowding, less likely pneumonia.
