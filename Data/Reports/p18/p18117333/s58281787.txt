                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a moderate new widespread but heterogeneous interstitial
 abnormality, which is worrisome for pulmonary edema superimposed on a
 background of normal lung tissue, noting a previous chest CT that showed
 substantial emphysema.  Perhaps less likely consideration would be atypical
 pneumonia, which could be considered clinically.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate heterogeneous interstitial abnormality, for which
 interstitial pulmonary edema should be considered.  Perhaps less likely, the
 appearance could reflect atypical infection in the appropriate setting.
