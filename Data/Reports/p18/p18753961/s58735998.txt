                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Panic attack, palpitations, history of prior lung
 resection, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Multiple surgical
 clips are noted in the left axilla and left lateral chest wall.  There is
 suture material in the left lower lung with pleural thickening and volume loss
 as well as cerclage wires at the level of a posterior rib osteotomy.  Findings
 are compatible with prior resection.  Allowing for this, there is no definite
 sign of focal consolidation within the left lung to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  No definite sign of pleural effusion.  The right lung is clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Aside from aforementioned
 left lower rib osteotomy defects, the imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post left partial lung resection with associated
 postoperative changes.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
