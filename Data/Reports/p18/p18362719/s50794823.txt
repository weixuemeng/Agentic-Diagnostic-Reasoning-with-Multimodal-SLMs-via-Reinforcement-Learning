                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with anasarca  // evidence of pulmonary edema?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable. Lung volumes are relatively low, and a bilateral reticular
 interstitial pattern is present with mid and lower lung predominance. Small
 left pleural effusion is also present as well as a nonspecific patchy opacity
 in the left lower lobe anterior medially.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe anterior medial basilar opacity, which could potentially
 be due to infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Adjacent
 small pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Mid and lower lung predominant reticular opacities are concerning for
 chronic interstitial lung disease.
 
 If the patient has symptoms of pneumonia, initial further evaluation with
 followup chest radiographs in 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy
 would be suggested.  If the interstitial abnormality persists at that time,
 high-resolution chest CT would be recommended.  In the absence of infectious
 symptoms, CT would be recommended at this time.  To further characterize both
 the left lower lobe abnormality in the more diffuse interstitial process.
