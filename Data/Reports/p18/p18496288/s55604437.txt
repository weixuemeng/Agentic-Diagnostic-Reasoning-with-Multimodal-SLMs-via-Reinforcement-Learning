                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the right base
 is consistent with volume loss in the lower lung and pleural effusion.  Mild
 atelectatic changes persist at the left base.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in good position.
