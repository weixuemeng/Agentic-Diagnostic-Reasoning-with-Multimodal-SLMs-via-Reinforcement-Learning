 seventh rib.  On the prior radiograph the tip of the PICC line was at the
 level of the ninth posterior right rib.  Likely it has been pulled back.
 
 Compared to the prior study pulmonary vascular congestion has almost
 completely resolved.  The patchy opacities at the lung bases have improved
 significantly.

 Significant improvement.
