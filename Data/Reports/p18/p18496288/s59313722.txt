                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with  abdominal pain with free air on
 outside hospital chest radiograph with bilateral wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  The chest radiograph described in the
 requisition is not provided for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased opacity at the right
 lung base is right middle lobe collapse. The radiograph suggests there is also
 partial right lower lobe atelectasis. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is
 limited by right lower lobe opacity.  There is free air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Free intraperitoneal air.
 2.  Complete right middle lobe collapse. Partial right lower lobe atelectasis.
