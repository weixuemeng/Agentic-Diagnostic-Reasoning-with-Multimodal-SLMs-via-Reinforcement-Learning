                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart again appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A pair of the lung nodules projects over the left upper lung,
 the larger perhaps as much as 11 mm in diameter and the smaller 7 mm, both
 with irregular contours.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear aside from streaky
 minor atelectasis or scarring that is unchanged in the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Pulmonary nodules, similar but
 perhaps increased.  Chest CT is recommended in short-term follow-up, when
 clinically appropriate, to reassess nodules.
