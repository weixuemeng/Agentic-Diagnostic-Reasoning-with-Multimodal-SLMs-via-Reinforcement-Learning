                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with VATS RUL bisegmentectomy s/p chest tube
 removal. Please do at noon.  // ptx?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the left-sided chest tube has been removed.
 
 Again seen is the superiorly convex contour, with some associated density,
 abutting the left hilum in the region of the chain sutures. The degree of
 associated opacity has improved.  This is not clearly a pneumothorax margin,
 as vessels project beyond it, though it is difficult to exclude some form of
 loculated pneumothorax in this setting. The density has been postulated to
 represent hemorrhage at the site of the chain sutures, but is not fully
 characterized on the basis of this exam.
 
 Otherwise, there appears to been some interval clearing of atelectasis at the
 left lung base. Minimal stranding at both bases remains present, as does
 slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 The right lung is otherwise without focal infiltrate or gross effusion.  The
 minimally displaced fracture of the right ninth rib Lat is unchanged compared
 with a preop film dated ___ and probably unchanged compared with
 in chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette may be very slightly smaller. Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval removal of left chest tube.
 2. No definite change in left-sided pneumothorax. Rounded contour in the left
 upper zone again seen. If clinically indicated, a lateral chest x-ray view may
 help to further characterize this finding.
 3. Slight interval improvement left base atelectasis.
 4. Otherwise, it I doubt significant interval change.
 5. Nonacute right ninth rib fracture again noted.
