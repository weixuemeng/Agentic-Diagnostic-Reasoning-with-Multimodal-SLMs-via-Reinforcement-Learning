  1.  ETT tip projects 6 cm from the carina, neck probably and extension. 
  Recommend advancing 1-2 cm.
  
  2. Enteric tube side port is in the distal esophagus or GE junction. 
  Recommend advancing 7-10 cm to ensure that it is in the stomach lumen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated.  ET tube placement confirmation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available on PACS at the time of
 this dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip projects approximately 6 cm from the carina with the neck probably
 in extension.  This could probably be further advanced 1-2 cm.  An enteric
 tube tip projects over in the expected region of a distended stomach, but the
 side port is above the diaphragm probably in the distal esophagus or near the
 GE junction.  This could be advanced by approximately 7-10 cm.
 
 No consolidation, effusion, edema, or pneumothorax.  Elevation with tenting of
 the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectasis/ volume loss, likely
 related to prior right upper lobe wedge resection.  The heart is top-normal in
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT tip projects 6 cm from the carina, neck probably and extension. 
 Recommend advancing 1-2 cm.
 
 2.  Enteric tube side port is in the distal esophagus or GE junction. 
 Recommend advancing 7-10 cm to ensure that it is in the stomach lumen.
