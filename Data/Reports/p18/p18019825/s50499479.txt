                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new dobhoff  // position of dobhoff     
 position of dobhoff
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a Dobhoff tube that extends to the mid body of the stomach.  There is
 increasing opacification at the left base with poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe
 and probable small effusion.
 The lower lung markings are indistinct, suggesting some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.
