                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy left base opacity may be due to atelectasis although consolidation is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Previously seen bilateral
 pleural effusions have essentially resolved in the interval.  No pneumothorax
 is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left base opacity could be due to atelectasis although consolidation
 due to pneumonia or aspiration is not excluded, nor is residua from prior lung
 findings.  Recommend followup to resolution.
