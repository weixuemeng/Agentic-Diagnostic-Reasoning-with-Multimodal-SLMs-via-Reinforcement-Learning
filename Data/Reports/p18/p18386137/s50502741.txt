                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with a previous right lung abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Air bronchograms seen on ___ in the paramedian right lower lung are not
 as prominent, and opacification in the right middle lobe on the lateral view
 is less striking.  Overall, the findings suggest improvement, and if this
 conforms to the clinical picture, I do not think any additional imaging is
 necessary.  If the patient still has respiratory symptoms, I would recommend
 CT scanning to clarify the nature of the abnormality.  Lungs are otherwise
 entirely clear, and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph
 node enlargement.  Heart size is normal.
