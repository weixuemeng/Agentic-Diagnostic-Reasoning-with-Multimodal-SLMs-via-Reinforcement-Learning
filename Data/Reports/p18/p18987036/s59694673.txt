                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with Horner, any mass?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upper lung hyperlucency is consistent with emphysema.  Mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Small
 apical subpleural opacity  is more prominent on the left side.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Apical subpleural opacity could be scarring but is asymmetric on the left
 side.  If Horner is on the left side, a CT scan should be considered.
