                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent diagnosis of pneumonia, worsening
 symptoms
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities are again seen within the
 lung bases bilaterally, more pronounced on the left, similar to that noted on
 the prior study.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Trace pleural effusions the likely
 account for the blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated.  Fusion hardware
 within the thoracolumbar spine is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar patchy opacities, more pronounced on the left, concerning
 for pneumonia or aspiration.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
