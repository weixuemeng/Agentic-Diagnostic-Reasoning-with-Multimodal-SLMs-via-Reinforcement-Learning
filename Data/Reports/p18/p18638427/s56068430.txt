 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax without shift in mediastinal contents to

 clinical history with compensatory volume loss in the underlying lungs so that
 there is no shift of the mediastinum. The left lung is essentially clear.
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
