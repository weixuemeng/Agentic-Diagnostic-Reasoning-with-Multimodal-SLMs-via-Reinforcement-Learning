 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained ___, mild pulmonary
 edema has resolved and a small right pleural effusion has decreased in size. 
 A right-sided pleural drainage catheter projects medially over the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Apparent double lung
 parenchyma is such that small pulmonary nodules could be missed.  A left-sided
 PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  An enteric tube passes into the stomach, the
