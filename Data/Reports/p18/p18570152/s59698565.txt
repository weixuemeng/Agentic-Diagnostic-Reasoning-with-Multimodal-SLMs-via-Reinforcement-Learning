                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Right lower
 lobe opacity is worrisome for consolidation, possibly due to pneumonia.  
 Along the superior aspect of the right lower lung consolidation, there is a
 0.9-cm nodular opacity, projecting between the posterior right sixth and
 seventh ribs, which could relate to consolidation or an underlying pulmonary
 nodule is not excluded.  Recommend followup chest radiograph after appropriate
 therapy and if finding remains, chest CT.  There is also a left suprahilar
 opacity, which could be a second site of infection or relate to mild volume
 overload.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Single-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen
 with leads in the expected position of the right ventricle.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe and left infrahilar opacities, right greater
 than left, in the appropriate clinical setting, raises concern for pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution. Possible 0.9 cm nodular opacity along the
 superior aspect of the right lower lung opacity, could relate to
 consolidation, but pulmonary nodule not excluded.  Recommend followup chest
 radiographs after appropriate therapy and if finding remains, chest CT.
 
 Left suprahilar opacity, which could be a second site of infection or relate
 to mild volume overload.
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
