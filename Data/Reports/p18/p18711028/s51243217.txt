  1. Left basilar opacity likely due to effusion with adjacent atelectasis
  although infection would also certainly be possible.
  2. Cardiomegaly, small right effusion and mild pulmonary edema.
  3. Enlarged right hilum, potentially due to enlarged pulmonary artery in the
  setting of pulmonary hypertension although underlying adenopathy would be
  possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea x1 wk, recently treated for pna.  // Please
 evaluate for infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  There is dense left basilar opacity likely in part due to pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although underlying infection would certainly be
 possible.  There is also small right pleura effusion.  There is indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature and cephalization compatible with mild pulmonary edema. 
 Enlargement of the right hilum could be due to pulmonary artery enlargement
 although underlying adenopathy would also be possible.  Moderate cardiac
 enlargement is noted.  Left chest wall dual lead pacing device seen with lead
 tips in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 1. Left basilar opacity likely due to effusion with adjacent atelectasis
 although infection would also certainly be possible.
 2. Cardiomegaly, small right effusion and mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Enlarged right hilum, potentially due to enlarged pulmonary artery in the
 setting of pulmonary hypertension although underlying adenopathy would be
 possible.
