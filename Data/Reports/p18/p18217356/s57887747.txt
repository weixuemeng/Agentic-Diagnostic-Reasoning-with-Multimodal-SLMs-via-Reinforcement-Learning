                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PE  // Is there interval change?      Is
 there interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  Read in
 conjunction with chest CTA on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial progression of pulmonary abnormality since ___. 
 Overwhelming likelihood is the patient has disseminated malignancy,
 responsible for rapidly growing global central adenopathy and large pulmonary
 masses.  The rapid progression over one months time suggests lymphoma or
 metastatic anaplastic histology.  The worsening over 24 hr is more likely due
 to concurrent edema.  Heart size normal.
 
 Of course concurrent pneumonia, pulmonary emboli, an even septic infarcts
 would be impossible to recognize, but these do not have to be invoked to
 explain the radiographic findings.
