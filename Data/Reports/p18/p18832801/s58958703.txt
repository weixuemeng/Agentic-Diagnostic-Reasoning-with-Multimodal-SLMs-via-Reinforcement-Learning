                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower back pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is partly calcified. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear aside from minimal right
 basilar atelectasis or scarring.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted
 along the lower thoracic spine.  There is partly visualized irregularity along
 the right acromioclavicular joint and possibly acro-osteolysis, which does not
 appear present on the left side.  This appearance could be post-traumatic,
 noting asymmetry.  There is no evidence of rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
