                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Asthma flare.
 
 The patient is slightly rotated; this limits the evaluation of the study. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There are opacities in the left lower
 lobe, likely atelectasis.  In the lateral view, rounded ill-defined opacity in
 one of the lower lobe should be evaluated with CT.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or effusion.
