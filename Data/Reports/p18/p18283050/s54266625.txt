                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever/chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Scarring within the right lung base is
 re- demonstrated with a right juxtaphrenic peak noted indicative of mild
 volume loss.  Previously demonstrated ground-glass opacities within the left
 lung, most pronounced in the left upper lobe, as well as multiple pulmonary
 nodules are better assessed on the prior CT.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
