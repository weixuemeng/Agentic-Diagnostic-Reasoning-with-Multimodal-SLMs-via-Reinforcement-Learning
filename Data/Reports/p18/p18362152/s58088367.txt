                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lungs are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  The hilar and pleural
 structures are normal.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  There are no
 displaced rib fractures appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture, if
 concern for fracture persists, a dedicated rib series with markers would be of
 utility.
