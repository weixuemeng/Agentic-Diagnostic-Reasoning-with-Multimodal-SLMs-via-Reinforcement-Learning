                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-barrel
 Port-A-Cath projects over the right upper chest with catheter tip extending
 into the expected location of the superior vena cava.  There is again noted to
 be a round mass in the right lower lobe, which is compatible with a known
 metastasis from a right renal sarcoma.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or
 CHF.  The transverse dimension of this lesion is 7.2 cm, slightly increased
 from prior CT from ___, at which time the transverse measurement was 6.9
 cm.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is stable.  Mediastinal contour unremarkable.  Bony structures
 intact.  No new lesions of the chest are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Metastatic lesion in the right lower lobe appears slightly
 increased in size compared with prior study, now 7.2 cm compared with 6.9 cm
 in transverse dimension.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.
