 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has
 been removed.  There is no evidence of an apical pneumothorax.  The lateral

 is a relatively extensive soft tissue air collection in the chest wall. 
 Minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases.  Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.
