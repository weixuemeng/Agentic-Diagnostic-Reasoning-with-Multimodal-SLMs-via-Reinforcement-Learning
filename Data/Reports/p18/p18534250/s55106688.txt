 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, dyspnea, evaluation for pleural
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed
 extensive bilateral pleural effusions.  The effusions are more severe on the
 right than on the left, on the right, the effusions occupying approximately
 half of the hemithorax.
 
 There are areas of bilateral relatively extensive atelectasis following the
 effusions.  The size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be precisely delineated.
 The upper mediastinal contours appear unremarkable.  In the well-ventilated
 areas of the lungs, there is no evidence of acute lung disease.  A 1-cm soft
 tissue density nodule projecting over the right lung base is seen on both the
 frontal and the lateral radiograph and could represent the nipple.
