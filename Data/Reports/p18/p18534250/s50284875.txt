 There are markedly low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort.  There is
 a left Port-A-Cath with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 increased opacities at the lung bases, which may be due to a combination of
 atelectasis versus developing infiltrates.  There are no signs for overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothoraces are present.
