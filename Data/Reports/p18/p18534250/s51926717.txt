                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pleural effusions with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the mid SVC.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of moderate left and small to moderate
 right pleural effusions, similar in size when compared to the previous exam. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect compressive atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Similar size of moderate left and small to moderate right pleural effusions
 with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. 
 Infection, however, at the lung bases is not excluded.
