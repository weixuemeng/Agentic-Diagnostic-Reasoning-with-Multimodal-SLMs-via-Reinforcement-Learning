                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent CABG, status post removal of chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes remain persistently low postoperatively with
 associated prominent bibasilar atelectasis.  The patient is status post CABG
 with median sternotomy wires in place and mediastinum does not appear widened.
 Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to obfuscation by low lung
 volumes and atelectasis.  There has been interval removal of a left-sided
 chest tube without evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter remains at the
 level of the upper-to-mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Removal of left-sided chest tube without pneumothorax.
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes with associated significant bibasilar
 atelectasis.
