                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxia  // ? acute pathology
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes appear low considerably more than on the prior film.  I suspect
 this is accentuated by kyphosis.  There is also slight rotation.  Allowing for
 differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the
 prior film.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  There is
 bibasilar patchy opacity more pronounced than on the prior film, most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  No gross effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low inspiratory volumes, more so than on the prior film question
 accentuated by kyphosis and positioning.
 2. Mild patchy opacity both lung bases, most suggestive of atelectasis.  In
 appropriate clinical setting, an early pneumonic infiltrate would have a
 similar appearance.
 3. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, without significant change.
 4. No pneumothorax or gross effusion detected.
