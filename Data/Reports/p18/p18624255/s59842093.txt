  New bilateral pulmonary alveolar opacities and increased interstitial lung
  markings, with persistent cardiomegaly, consistent with pulmonary edema and
  worsening heart failure.  Followup to resolution is recommended following
  diuresis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB.  Evaluate for evidence of CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, there are new bilateral pulmonary alveolar
 opacities, most pronounced in the right lower lung, as well as increased
 interstitial lung markings, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are also seen.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Central venous
 catheter is also unchanged is position, with its tip at the level of the right
 ventricle.  A large hiatal hernia is not as well seen as the prior study, but
 also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings are most consistent with asymmetrical edema accompanied by bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Considering the asymmetrical distribution, followup
 radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude superimposed pneumonia in
 the right lung if warranted clinically.
