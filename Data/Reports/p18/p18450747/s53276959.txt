 Chest CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD with dual leads following their expected course to the right
 atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  Lungs are fully expanded. Volume
 loss and pleural thickening in the left upper lobe, better appreciated on CTA
 from ___ are consistent with prior chest radiation for Hodgkin's
 disease.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Probable
 minimal left pleural calcification.  Mild unfolding of the descending thoracic
 aorta is stable.  Heart size is normal.
