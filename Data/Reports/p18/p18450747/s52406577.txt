                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is again noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is normal.  Leftward deviation of the
 trachea due to enlargement of the right thyroid lobe is unchanged.  Re-
 demonstrated is pleural thickening, chronic opacification and volume loss in
 the left upper lobe, unchanged, compatible with post radiation changes for
 prior Hodgkin's disease with similar superior retraction of the left hilum. 
 Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is similar to the previous exam. 
 Streaky opacity is demonstrated in the right lung base.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Small left pleural effusion is new.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Clips project over the
 left upper quadrant of the abdomen and epigastric region.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion.
 2. Streaky right basilar opacity, possibly atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.
 3. Post radiation changes in the left upper lobe.
 4. Unchanged dilatation of the main pulmonary artery.
