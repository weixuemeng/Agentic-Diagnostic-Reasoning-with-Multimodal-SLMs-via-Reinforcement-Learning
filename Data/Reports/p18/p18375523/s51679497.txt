                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male with chest pain and hypertension.  Please
 evaluate for dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable hilar and
 cardiac contours.  Patient has a tortuous aorta.  Interval widening of the
 mediastinum compared to ___, though this is likely exaggerated by
 patient positioning and bilateral low lung volumes.  Lungs are clear.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Patient is status post
 sternotomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent minimal interval widening of mediastinum likely
 exaggerated by patient positioning and low lung volumes though cannot exclude
 aneurysmal dilatation which could be further evaluated for on chest CTA.
