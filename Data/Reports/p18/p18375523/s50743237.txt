                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Suspected pneumonia versus pneumonitis with tachypnea and
 tachycardia and increased cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with the
 most recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion is new.  There is minimal opacity at right
 lung base with some volume loss and this reflects atelectasis or pneumonic
 consolidation is difficult to differentiate.  Left lung and right upper lung
 are clear.  There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and the sternal
 sutures are intact.  Status post aortic valve replacement.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pleural abnormality
 on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Small right pleural effusion and ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung
 which either reflects atelectasis or early pneumonia should be monitored on
 the followup radiographs.
