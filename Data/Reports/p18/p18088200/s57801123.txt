                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia and abdominal pain.  History of renal transplant.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery
 bypass graft surgery.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged, including a prominent left-sided epicardial
 fat pad.  The lung volumes are low.  Streaky lingular opacity suggesting minor
 atelectasis or scarring appears unchanged.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus is more suggestive of similar slight atelectatic change,
 less likely persistent trace pleural effusion.  There has been no significant
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
