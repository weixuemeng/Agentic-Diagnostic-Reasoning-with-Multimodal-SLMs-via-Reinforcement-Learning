                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Subtle posterior left lower lobe equivocal opacity in the lateral
 view with no correlate on the AP view may be due to atelectasis, though an
 early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
