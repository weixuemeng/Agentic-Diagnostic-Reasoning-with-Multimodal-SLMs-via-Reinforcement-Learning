                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or other acute pathology in a
 patient presenting with shortness of breath, worse while laying flat.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate persistently low lung
 volumes with chronic atelectasis, which limited evaluation of the cardiac
 silhouette.  There is mild scarring at the right base.  Obscuration of the
 medial left hemidiaphragm is likely due to atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
