 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Presyncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged with similar mild prominent of the main pulmonary artery
 contour.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild prominence of
 central interstitial opacities appears, if anything, decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Similar mild prominence of the
 aortopulmonary window, possibly due to mild pulmonary artery enlargement.
