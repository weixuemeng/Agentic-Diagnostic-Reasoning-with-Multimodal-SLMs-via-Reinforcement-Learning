                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain midsternal x3 hours
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  Subtle increased opacity abuts the left heart border which likely
 reflects crowding of bronchovascular markings in the setting of low lung
 volumes though an early pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  Right lung is
 clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No signs of congestion or edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity abutting the left heart border which could represent a very
 early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Please note, low lung
 volumes limits assessment.
