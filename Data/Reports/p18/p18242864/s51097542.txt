                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea // eval for acute process, c/f CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CTA chest from ___ and chest
 radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomegaly again noted.  There is hilar congestion and mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  Lower lung opacities may reflect edema though a superimposed
 pneumonia difficult to exclude.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely
 present.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions.  Lower
 lung opacities may reflect edema versus superimposed pneumonia.
