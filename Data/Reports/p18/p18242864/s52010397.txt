 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Opacification in the lower lungs
 obscures both heart borders and diaphragmatic surfaces.  It is hard to say
 whether this is due to dependent edema and atelectasis alone or whether
 pneumonia is present, but there is moderate bilateral pleural effusion and
 pulmonary vascular congestion suggesting cardiac decompensation is part of the
 problem.  No pneumothorax.
