 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Lung bases have cleared substantially since ___, probably a combination of
 improving edema, atelectasis, and pleural effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists, but pulmonary vascular congestion in the upper lobes has also
 improved.  A 3 cm wide nodular opacity projecting over the left first anterior
 interspace could be residual edema.  Conventional radiographs should be
 obtained when feasible.  No pneumothorax.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional radiographs to evaluate nodular abnormality,
 left upper lobe.
