                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stage IV lung cancer presenting with subacute
 onset of dyspnea and right middle/lower lung field crackles
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Fullness of the left perihilar region corresponds to
 known mass, better assessed on the previous CT, and appears unchanged from the
 prior radiograph. Right hilar and mediastinal contours are similar. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. The lungs are hyperinflated with mild emphysematous
 changes again noted in the lung apices. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the
 lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study. Fullness of the left
 perihilar region compatible with known mass, better assessed on the prior CT.
 Emphysema. No focal consolidation.
