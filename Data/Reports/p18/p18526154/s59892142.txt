                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left lower lobe collapse secondary to
 probable central obstructing primary lung cancer.  The patient is status post
 interval bronchoscopic stent placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement of a
 stent in the left lower lobe bronchus, though the stent is not visualized on
 this radiographic examination.  Prior left lower lobe collapse has resolved in
 the interval.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  No large pleural
 effusion is identified.  Mild prominence of the hila bilaterally is secondary
 to known adenopathy.  Barium is seen within the colon in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval stent placement in the left lower lobe bronchus
 resulting in near-complete re-expansion of the left lower lobe.
