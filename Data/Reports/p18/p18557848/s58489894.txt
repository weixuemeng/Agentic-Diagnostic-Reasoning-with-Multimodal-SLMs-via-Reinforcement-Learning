                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoglycemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided pacemaker device
 is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Aortic knob calcifications are present.
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Low lung volumes cause crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 without overt pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
