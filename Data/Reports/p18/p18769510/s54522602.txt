                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube placement.  Please
 evaluate position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased vascular markings with upper lobe
 redistribution compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  There are no focal
 opacities.  There is bilateral hilar prominence.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 also present.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is likely a trace
 left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
 A tunneled right sided dialysis line is seen ending at the level of the right
 atrium.  A left-sided central line barely crosses the midline, probably
 terminating at the brachiocephalic junction.  There is a nasogastric tube with
 the tip ending below the inferior borders of the film.  An endotracheal tube
 ends 4.2 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. Left internal
 jugular central venous line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
 Remaining support devices are in standard positions.
