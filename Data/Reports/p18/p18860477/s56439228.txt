                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Patient has known non-small cell lung cancer.  Mediastinal widening and
 post-radiation changes on the right are similar to the prior study.  Small
 amount of pleural effusion is noted, although no substantial change since the
 prior study has been demonstrated.  There is also no evidence of additional
 right mediastinal shift.  The aerated portion of right lung is small but
 unchanged.
 
 Suspicion is of a new small left pleural effusion that might be correlated
 with ultrasound examination.
