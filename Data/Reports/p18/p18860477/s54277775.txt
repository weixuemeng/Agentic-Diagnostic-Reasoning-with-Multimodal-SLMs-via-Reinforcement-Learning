 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:28 PM
  Persistent near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with aeration
  superiorly and rightward mediastinal shift, consistent with volume loss. Left
  lung clear with inteval decrease in left pleural effusion and no detected left
  pneumothorax. Discussed with ___ by phone at 7:27 p.m. on ___
  at the time of initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right hemithorax is nearly completely opacified, and the degree
 of opacification has slightly worsened compared to the prior study with only a
 small amount of residual aerated lung in the right upper lobe.  The right main
 bronchus is markedly narrowed and irregular in contour, consistent with
 involvement by known non-small cell lung cancer as demonstrated on prior chest
 CT ___ ___.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Small left effusion has
 decreased in size. Sclerosis of the T8 and T9 vertebral bodies is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening opacification of the right hemithorax, consistent with
 near-complete collapse of the right lung secondary to known central lung
 cancer, and accompanied by pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
 2.  Near resolution of small left pleural effusion.
