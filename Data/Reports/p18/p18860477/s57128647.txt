                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known lung cancer with history of pleural effusions and shortness
 of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiographs dated ___ and review of CT dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is extensive right lung opacification consistent with
 known lung carcinoma and areas of atelectasis and consolidation.  There is
 also a small right pleural effusion.  As compared to the prior examination,
 there is slightly improved aeration of the right hemithorax.  On the left,
 there is a small pleural effusion.  Known left pulmonary nodules are better
 evaluated on the CT examination.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax identified.
 
 2.  Known extensive right lung cancer with subsequent atelectasis and
 consolidation.  As compared to the prior exam, there is slightly improved
 aeration of the right hemithorax.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Known
 left-sided pulmonary nodules are better evaluated by CT.
