                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left-sided pleural effusion after thoracocentesis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is a minimal interval change in the right pleural effusion.  The
 appearance of the right mediastinal shift, most likely post-radiation changes
 and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is substantial interval
 decrease in left pleural effusion (most likely thoracocentesis on the left
 side).  Pulmonary nodules seen on the chest CT can be also appreciated in the
 left lung as well.
