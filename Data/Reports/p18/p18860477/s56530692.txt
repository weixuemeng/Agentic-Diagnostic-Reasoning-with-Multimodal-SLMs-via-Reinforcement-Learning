                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion and history of metastatic
 non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate near-complete
 opacification of the right lung which is unchanged from most recent chest
 radiograph.  This is associated with right volume loss.  There is a small left
 pleural effusion again seen, unchanged.  Multiple left-sided pulmonary nodules
 are again seen.  The left lung is otherwise again seen to be clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the large right effusion.  Two
 vertebral bodies at the level of the left hemidiaphragm are seen to be of
 increased opacity, consistent with patient's history of metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged chest radiograph with persistent near-complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax.
