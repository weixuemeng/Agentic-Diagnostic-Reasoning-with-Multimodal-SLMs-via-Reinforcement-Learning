                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and hemoptysis.  Evaluate for
 infection or acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Opacification of the right hemithorax has slightly worsened, compatible with
 volume loss and increased size of right pleural effusion.  Left pleural
 effusion has also increased in size.  Post-radiation interstitial changes of
 the right lung and mediastinal widening are similar to prior.  Several lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies are diffusely sclerotic, similar to prior.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right hemithorax opacification with
 increased bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on the right and small on
 the left.
