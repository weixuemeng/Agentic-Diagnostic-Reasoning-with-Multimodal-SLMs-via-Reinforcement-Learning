                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of end-stage non-small
 cell lung cancer, recent left thoracentesis in ___, here with chronic
 functional status, decreased p.o. intake, markedly decreased breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Again seen is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, similar to
 prior.  In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a
 moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  The visualized cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with the right aspect not well evaluated due to the
 right hemithorax opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of moderate-to-large left pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 Persistent near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax.
