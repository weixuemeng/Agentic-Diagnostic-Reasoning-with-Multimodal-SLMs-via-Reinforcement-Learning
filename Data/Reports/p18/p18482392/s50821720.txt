                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest read
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L VATS talc pleurodesis, pericardial window
 // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR performed yesterday afternoon, one of the left chest tubes
 has been removed and there is now one remaining. Worsening opacification of
 the left hemithorax that partially spares the left apex, likely from a
 moderate/severe pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  There is also
 right lung base atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
 
 The pneumopericardium has resolved.  However, the cardiac silhouette is
 noticeably larger than yesterday; this may be due to rightward mediastinal
 shift from the left pleural effusion, or worsening pericardial effusion.
 Unchanged appearance of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall.
 Surgical clips are noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval removal of 1 of 2 left chest tubes.  Worsening opacification of
 left hemithorax, likely due to moderate/severe pleural effusion with
 atelectasis.
 2. Pneumopericardium resolved.
 3.  Enlarging cardiac silhouette, which may be due to the left pleural
 effusion or re-accumulating pericardial effusion.  Recommend obtaining
 echocardiogram for clarification.
