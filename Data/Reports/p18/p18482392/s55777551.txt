                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent left effusion s/p ___  // ?
 PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 08:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the thoracentesis, the left pleural effusion has essentially resolved. 
 There is an area of consolidation in the left mid-lung region that obscures
 the left heart border, suggesting possible lingular pneumonia. This was seen
 on the prior radiograph this morning, but was partially obscured by the
 effusion.  There is also a vertical line in the peripheral of the left
 hemithorax that mimics a loculated pneumothorax but there or are pleural
 markings beyond this line. No apical pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval resolution of the left pleural effusion status post thoracentesis.
 2. There is an area of consolidation that obscures the left heart border, and
 likely represents a lingular pneumonia.
 3. Vertical line in left hemithorax is unlikely due to a loculated
 pneumothorax given the presence of pleural markings beyond it.
