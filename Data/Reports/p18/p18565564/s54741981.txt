                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT of the chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Lungs remain hyperexpanded.  A previously present peripheral 2.3 cm
 diameter opacity in the right upper lobe has decreased in size and
 radiographic density with residual ill-defined opacity remaining at the level
 of the fourth right anterior rib level.  No definite new areas of lung
 opacification have developed, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving peripheral right upper lobe opacity, which is most
 likely due to slowly resolving infection or organizing pneumonia.  Given the
 history of fever and the presence of multifocal abnormalities on ___ chest CT, followup chest CT may be helpful to assess for lung
 abnormalities below the resolution of conventional chest radiographs.
