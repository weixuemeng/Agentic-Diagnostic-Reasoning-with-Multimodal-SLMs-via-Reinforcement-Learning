                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple focal predominantly pleural-based pulmonary infiltrate seen
 on prior chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  These are the first chest x-rays from this institution.  Comparison
 is made to chest CT from ___ which showed multiple predominantly
 pleural-based focal masses/infiltrates.  The current chest x-ray demonstrates
 irregular opacities, most marked on the right, the largest of which is 2.3 cm
 in the right mid lung laterally with other pleural-based lesions lower on the
 right.  There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.  The other lesions are
 better detected on the chest CT.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine with anterior osteophytes.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The multiplicity of the lesions and characterization is best
 performed on the prior CT.  The largest lesion on the right measures 2.3 cm on
 this chest x-ray.
