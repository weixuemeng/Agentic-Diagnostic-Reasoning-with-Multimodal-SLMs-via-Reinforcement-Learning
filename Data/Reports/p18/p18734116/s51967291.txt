                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant, on immunosuppression, presenting with
 anemia and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 similar unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a newly apparent nodular density at the left lung
 apex measuring about a centimeter in diameter and of unclear etiology,
 although potentially a lung nodule.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight degenerative changes are noted
 along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Nodular density projecting over
 the left lung apex, of uncertain significance, but potentially a true lung
 nodule.  When clinically appropriate, evaluation with chest CT is recommended
 to assess further.  Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. ___ at
 1:40 am on ___, by telephone.
