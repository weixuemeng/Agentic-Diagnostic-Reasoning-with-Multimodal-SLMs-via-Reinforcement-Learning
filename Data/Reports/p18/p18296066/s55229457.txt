                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Desaturation, increasing work of breathing.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___ and concurrent CT of the chest.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC. 
 There is esophageal stent in unchanged position.  Large bibasilar opacities
 greater on the left side are a combination of pleural effusions and adjacent
 atelectasis.  Left upper lobe opacity could be atelectasis or pneumonia,
 better seen on concurrent CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged, partially obscured by the pleural parenchymal
 abnormalities.
