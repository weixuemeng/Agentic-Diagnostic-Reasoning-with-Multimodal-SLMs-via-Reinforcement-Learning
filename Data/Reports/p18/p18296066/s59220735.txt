                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New onset of fever and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Aneurysmatic dilatation and tortuosity of the descending aorta are
 demonstrated.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear to be increased in the
 interim.  There is increase in the right lower lobe opacity that potentially
 might reflect aspiration or pneumonia developed in the interim.  The
 esophageal stent is in unchanged position.  Substantial shift of the trachea
 to the right due to the presence of aneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta is
 redemonstrated.
