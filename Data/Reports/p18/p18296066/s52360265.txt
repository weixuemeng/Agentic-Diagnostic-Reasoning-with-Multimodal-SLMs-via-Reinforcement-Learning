                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, to look for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright chest view was read in comparison with multiple
 prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral perihilar haziness, pulmonary vascular congestion,
 mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions complaining lower lung
 atelectasis, left side more than right and minimal fluid in the right minor
 fissure are unchanged since ___.  Top normal heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Stent in the mid and lower
 esophagus, unchanged.  Left PICC line tip is at left brachiocephalic and
 superior venocaval junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Given the extent of vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
 effusions, concurrently associated pneumonia on this single frontal view,
 however, cannot be ruled out.
