                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ including upper GI series.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-erect AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 3
 cm above the carina.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a recurrent collection of air projecting along the lower
 mediastinum bilaterally.  There are moderate to large bilateral pleural
 effusions, more prominent on the right than left with patchy opacities in the
 medial lower lung suggesting atelectasis.  Other etiologies such as pneumonia
 and aspiration cannot be excluded, however.  Contrast from barium study
 projects over the left mid abdomen.  In addition, the right upper quadrant
 shows some air in a geographic distribution suggesting residual
 pneumoperitoneum but potentially increased.  Pneumomediastinum also persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Findings which suggesting a
 large air pocket in the lower mediastinum, which may reflect a dilated viscus
 or extraluminal air-fluid collection, as well as persistent and potentially
 increased intraperitoneal air; correlation to CT performed on the same day is
 recommended.  Moderate to large suspected pleural effusions with parenchymal
 opacities at the lung bases probably atelectasis.  Differential considerations
 include aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded, however.  Case discussed
 with Dr. ___ at 7 pm in person.
