 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Dobbhoff feeding tube which had dislodged. 
 Assess position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Serial portable images of the chest and

 initial image shows the tip of the catheter within the distal esophagus. 
 Subsequent image shows that the catheter has been advanced, now with the tip
 in the proximal stomach.  Otherwise, there has been no significant change
 compared to recent prior examination.  The opacification of the right lung
 base is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Readjusted Dobbhoff tube, now with the tip within the proximal
 stomach.  No other significant change compared to prior.
