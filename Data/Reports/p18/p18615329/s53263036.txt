                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess Dobbhoff position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff has been pulled back slightly, and the tip now resides
 in the gastric antrum.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Again seen is a small right pleural effusion, not increased compared to prior
 study.  There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.  Increased density
 in the left upper lung is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Dobbhoff with tip in the gastric antrum. Positioning the patient right side
 down may facilitate spontaneous movement of the Dobhoff into the duodenum.
 2. New left upper lobe aspiration or pneumonia.
 3. Stable small right pleural effusion.
