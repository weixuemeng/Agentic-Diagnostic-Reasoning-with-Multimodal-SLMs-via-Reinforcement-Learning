  1. The dobhoff tube has been advanced with the tip in the stomach.  2.
  Persistent moderate-to-large right hydropneumothorax.  In comparison to the
  prior exams, the amount of fluid may be slightly decreased and the amount of
  air slightly increased, though that may be positioning.  3. Persistent right
  mid lung zone consolidation, likely compressive atelectasis, though infection
  is a consideration.  Clear left lung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hydrothorax status post thoracentesis with
 lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:10.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dobbhoff tube has been advanced so that the tip is within the
 stomach, however, the tube is coiled with tip pointing toward the gastric
 fundus.  Moderate right pleural effusion.  There is persistent
 moderate-to-large right hydropneumothorax.  In comparison to the prior exams,
 amount of fluid may be slightly decreased; however, this may relate to changes
 in patient position.  There is left base atelectasis without definite focal
 consolidation.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
