  Dobhoff tube coiled in the stomach, does not appear to be post-pyloric. 
  Otherwise unchanged appearance of the lungs, including a right
  hydropneumothorax.  Increased opacification in the right upper lung zone is
  likely due to redistribution of layering pleural fluid given that the patient
  is now in a supine position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cirrhosis and NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:57.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dobbhoff tube is seen coiled in the stomach, tip pointing towards
 the gastric fundus and does not appeared to be post-pyloric position.  The
 patient has known right hydropneumothorax with apparent increase in pleural
 fluid which is likely due in large part to the patient being supine on this
 study, with layering fluid as opposed to upright on the prior studies.  There
 has been interval increase in perihilar opacities that may be due to mild
 edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
