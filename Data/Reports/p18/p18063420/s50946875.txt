 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of cirrhosis presents with worsening
 shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and  chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung
 bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
