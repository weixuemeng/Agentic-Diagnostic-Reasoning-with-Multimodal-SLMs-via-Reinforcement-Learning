                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of breast cancer, now with bloody
 phlegm, here to evaluate for pulmonary mass or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show clear lungs
 without pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.  There is no
 appreciable pulmonary nodule.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The aortic knob is partially calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No appreciable pulmonary lesions by radiography.  Given the patient's
 history of breast cancer, a followup CT would be recommended to exclude
 endobronchial lesions which are radiographically occult.
