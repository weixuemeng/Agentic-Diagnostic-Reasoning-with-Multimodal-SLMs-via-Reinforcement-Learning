                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 2:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CLL, CAD, and prior DVTs.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 14:55.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 2:00 a.m. are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysematous changes.
 There is an air-fluid level at the left costophrenic sulcus consistent with a
 small hydropneumothorax.  The patient is status post median sternotomy. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A dual-lead left-sided
 pacer remains in place.  Several right-sided old rib fractures are again
 identified.  Patchy opacity at the left base likely reflects partial lower
 lobe atelectasis related to the presence of the effusion.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Results were communicated by phone to the patient's nurse,
 ___ at 9:05 a.m. given the discrepancy with the wet reading.
