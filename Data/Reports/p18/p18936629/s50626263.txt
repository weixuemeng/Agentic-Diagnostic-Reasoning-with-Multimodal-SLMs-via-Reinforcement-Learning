                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 20:04
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated with new orogastric tube, check
 position.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13:13.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip below the
 diaphragm, but the side port is within the distal esophagus and therefore
 advancement by approximately 10 cm would be recommended.  The endotracheal
 tube, right internal jugular central line, and dual-lead left-sided pacer are
 unchanged in position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status
 post median sternotomy for CABG.  There are small layering bilateral effusions
 with interval improvement in the mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are now better visualized.  No pneumothorax
 is appreciated.
