                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after thoracocentesis while
 fully anticoagulated with multiple hemothoraces and entrapped lung.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The appearance of the cardiac silhouette, mediastinum and bilateral pleural
 effusions is overall unchanged.  Minimal increase in right pleural effusion is
 noted, although questionable and might be related to patient positioning.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  Left chest tube is in place.  The pacemaker
 leads are unchanged in appearance.
