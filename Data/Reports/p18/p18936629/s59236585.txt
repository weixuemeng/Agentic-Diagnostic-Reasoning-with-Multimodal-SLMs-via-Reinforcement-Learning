                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CLL with recent VATS decortication for
 left pleural effusion, now with generalized weakness, elevated WBC, assess for
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips are noted as well as clips in
 the upper mid abdomen.  A dual-lead pacemaker is again seen with leads
 extending to the right atrium and right ventricle.  Compared with prior exam,
 there is persistent bilateral lung base opacity which likely corresponds with
 pleural thickening and small pleural effusion as seen on prior.  However,
 there is subtle increased hazy opacity in the left lung base which could
 represent an early pneumonia.  The upper lungs remain well aerated.  Old right
 rib deformities are re-demonstrated involving right ribs 6 and 7.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with bilateral small pleural
 effusions and pleural thickening with mild increased opacity at the left lung
 base which in the correct clinical setting may represent an early pneumonia.
