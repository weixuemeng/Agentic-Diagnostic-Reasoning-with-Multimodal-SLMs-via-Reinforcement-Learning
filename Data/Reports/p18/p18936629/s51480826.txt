                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with a small left apical
 pneumothorax, in retrospect unchanged since the prior radiograph, as well as a
 persistent small left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable
 in appearance.  Improving aeration at right lung base with residual small
 pleural effusion and adjacent basilar lung opacity which probably represents
 atelectasis.
