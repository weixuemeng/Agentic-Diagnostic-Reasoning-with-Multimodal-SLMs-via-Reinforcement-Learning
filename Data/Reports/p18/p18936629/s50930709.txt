                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 There is a small left pneumothorax.  Left basal chest tube remains in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Pacer leads are in standard
 position.  Increasing retrocardiac opacities are consistent with increasing
 atelectasis.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is improved.  Allowing for
 difference in positioning of the patient, small bilateral effusions are
 unchanged, .  Left subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
