                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CLL, CAD and prior DVTs.  Evaluate for
 progression of pleural effusion, monitoring of hydropneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 2:00 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 8:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy and there are multiple surgical clips overlying the cardiac
 and mediastinal contours as well as the upper abdomen.  Left basilar chest
 tube remains in place and the loculated pneumothorax at the left base may be
 slightly smaller as a fluid level is no longer appreciated; however, this
 could just be related to differences in positioning.  Multiple right-sided rib
 fractures are again identified.  There continues to be patchy left basalir
 opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.  Small right effusion is now evident.
