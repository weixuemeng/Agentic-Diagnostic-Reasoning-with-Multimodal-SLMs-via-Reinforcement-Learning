 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, respiratory failure, evaluation for
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube has been slightly pulled back.  The tip now projects approximately 6.6 cm
 above the carina.  The tip could be advanced by approximately 2-3 cm.
 
 Unchanged are the other monitoring and support devices.  Unchanged sternal
 wires and clips after CABG.  Unchanged extent of bilateral pleural effusions
 with subsequent areas of mild basal atelectasis.  Unchanged borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
