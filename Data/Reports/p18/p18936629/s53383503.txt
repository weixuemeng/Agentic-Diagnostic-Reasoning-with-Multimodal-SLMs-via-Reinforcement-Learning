                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post decortication with recent CT showing
 multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___; most recent
 from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right mid lung opacity corresponds to known
 consolidation within the basilar right upper lobe.  Bibasilar consolidations
 with effusions is likely a combination of infection and longstanding pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position terminating 2.8 cm from the carina.  Pacemaker generator and leads
 are in expected unchanged position.  A right approach central venous catheter
 terminates in the mid SVC.  Overall aeration of the lungs is similar compared
 to most recent prior radiograph.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Expected position of support devices.  Overall unchanged aeration
 of the lungs with multifocal pneumonia and small bilateral effusions.
