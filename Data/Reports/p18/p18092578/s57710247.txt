                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Very small left apical pneumothorax is present, decreased from
 recent radiograph, and a previous basilar component of the pneumothorax has
 filled with fluid.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Bilateral
 pulmonary nodules appear similar to the prior study and have been more fully
 evaluated by CT.  Worsening opacity at left base could be due to atelectasis
 or infectious consolidation.  Note is also made of a partially layering small
 right pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.
