                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SIADH with significant smoking history and chest CT concerning for
 malignancy now with acute dyspnea.  Evaluate for worsening pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Assessment for changes in pleural effusion volume
 is difficult given the differences in positioning.  Within this limitation,
 the moderate to large left and small right pleural effusions are bigger than
 ___ but probably unchanged from ___.  Left basilar
 atelectasis persists.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  The numerous pulmonary nodules are largely
 obscured by the pleural effusions and are better defined on the recent chest
 CT.
