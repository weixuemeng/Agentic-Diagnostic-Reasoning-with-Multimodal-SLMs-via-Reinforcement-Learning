                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 There is interval decrease in the left pleural effusion related to
 thoracocentesis with overall improvement of the left lung aeration.  Minimal
 left apical pneumothorax is present and should be further followed.  Bibasal
 opacities are unchanged as well as the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Overall,
 no change in the pneumothorax as compared to prior examination demonstrated.
