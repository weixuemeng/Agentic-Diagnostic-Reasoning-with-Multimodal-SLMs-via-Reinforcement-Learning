 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 1:57 PM
  1.  New right lower lobe pneumonia.
  2.  Chronic left lower lobe collapse due to left pleural effusion and probable
  compressive atelectasis.  
  3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate and unchanged position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CML status post pericardiocentesis, intubated for hypoxia, status
 post thoracentesis.  Presenting with fever and persistent hypoxia.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement and left base consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ to ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is in appropriate
 position approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube passes
 inferiorly into the stomach out of view, with the side port overlying the
 expected location of the stomach.  A right subclavian central venous catheter
 terminates at the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.  
 
 The lung volumes are lower.  Chronic collapse of the left lower lobe is again
 noted due to overlying moderate pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. 
 There is new heterogeneous opacification of the right lower lobe.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary vascular
 markings are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Chronic left lower lobe collapse due to left pleural effusion and probable
 compressive atelectasis.  
 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate and unchanged position.
