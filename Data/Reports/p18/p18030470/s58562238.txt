                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, status post intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in standard position.  There is apparent improvement in the
 hazy opacification on the right, though this could reflect a more upright
 position of the patient.  The left effusion is essentially unchanged.
