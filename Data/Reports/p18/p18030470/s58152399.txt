                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia,
 complicated with pericardial effusion and pleural effusion, now status post
 right-sided thoracocentesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. 
 The previously identified right internal jugular central venous line remains
 in unchanged position.  The patient remains intubated, the ET terminating in
 the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina.  During the interval, a
 right-sided thoracocentesis has been performed and the right-sided basal hazy
 density has markedly improved and the right lung base is now free with clear
 delineation of the diaphragmatic contour and absence of fluid accumulation in
 the right lateral pleural sinus.  The left-sided basal density and partial
 obscuration of the diaphragm remains rather unchanged.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful right-sided thoracocentesis with eliminating pleural
 effusion almost totally.  No evidence of pneumothorax following the procedure.
