                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval extubation and removal of the esophageal
 catheter.  Mediastinal drains have also been removed.  Right-sided central
 venous catheter appears similarly positioned.  
 
 Lung volumes are low with slightly improved retrocardiac atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are stable;
 calcification along the left ventricular contour is noted.  There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema.  A small amount of pneumomediastinum persists
 but is decreased compared to prior.
