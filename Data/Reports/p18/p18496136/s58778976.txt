                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart size is stable.  Small linear calcification
 along the left heart border may potentially represent left ventricular
 aneurysmal calcification.  Echocardiography is recommended for further
 evaluation.  Thought differential diagnosis includes pericardial
 calcification, given the location is less likely.  Increased retrocardiac
 density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is better since ___.
 Small left pleural effusion is presumed and unchanged. Right lung is clear.
 There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and sternal sutures are intact.
