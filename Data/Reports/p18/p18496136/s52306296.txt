                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Follow up and to look for the changes in the pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Allowing for the differences in the radiographic technique, since ___, mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged; however, the
 left lower lung atelectasis has minimally improved.  Both lungs are clear. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with intact sternal sutures following
 CABG.  Central line through the right internal jugular approach ends at the
 lower SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for the differences in radiographic technique since
 ___, mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged;
 however, the left lower lung atelectasis reflected by increased retrocardiac
 density has improved.
