                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lethargy, and abdominal pain.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Linear opacity at the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis.  There is also, however, blunting of the lateral costophrenic
 angle suggestive of an effusion.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Please note
 that the lateral view is limited secondary to patient's arms down by his side.
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity at the right lung base most suggestive of
 atelectasis; however, infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Possible small
 right pleural effusion.
