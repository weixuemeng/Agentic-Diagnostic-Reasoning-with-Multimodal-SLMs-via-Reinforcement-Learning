 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. Patchy opacification primarily involving the lingula but
 possibly also the left lower lobe some extent suggests bronchopneumonia.
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.

 Findings consistent with pneumonia.
