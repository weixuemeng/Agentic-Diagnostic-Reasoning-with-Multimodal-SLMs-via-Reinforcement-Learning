                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory distress.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso of ___, chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  There is a
 large left pleural effusion, which has increased since ___ CT exam, with
 associated left basilar atelectasis.  The patient's known dominant lingular
 mass is obscured by adjacent opacities.  Small portion of the left lung
 remains aerated.  The patient's known right lung nodules are better
 characterized on CT of ___.  There is a small right pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size is difficult to discern due to adjacent opacities, but is likely
 enlarged.  Perihilar vascular congestion.  There is mild rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures likely secondary to large left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left pleural effusion, leading to mild rightward deviation of the
 mediastinal structures has significantly increased in size since ___ CT
 exam.  Small right pleural effusion.  The patient's known bilateral pulmonary
 nodules and lingular mass are better characterized on  CT dated ___.
