                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new onset of dizziness and altered mental
 status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  Linear
 opacities at the left greater than right lung bases are most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  However, given more confluent opacity in the lateral view
 underlying consolidation is also possible.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable given lower inspiratory effort.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes limiting exam.  Bibasilar opacities,
 potentially due to atelectasis; however, component of infection is not
 completely excluded.  Clinical correlation suggested and repeat exam with
 better inspiratory effort can be performed if desired.
