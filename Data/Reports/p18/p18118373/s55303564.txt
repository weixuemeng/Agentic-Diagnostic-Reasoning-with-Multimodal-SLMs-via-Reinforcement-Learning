                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Better seen on the current exam is streaky linear opacity in the
 retrocardiac region.  A minimal opacity at the right lung base as well. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in
 configuration.  Right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of bibasilar atelectasis; however,
 component of infection is not completely excluded and clinical correlation is
 suggested.
