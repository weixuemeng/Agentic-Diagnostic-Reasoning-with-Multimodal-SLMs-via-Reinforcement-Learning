                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:49.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Lingular mass was better assessed on recent prior CT.  There is an interval
 development of mild pulmonary edema.  Interval development of increased right
 medial lung base opacity most likely relates to fluid overload with possible
 underlying atelectasis rather than infection given its short-term development.
 There is also increased opacity at the lateral left lung base, again may be
 due to atelectasis and/or related to fluid overload given short-term
 development.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No large
 pleural effusion seen.  The mediastinum is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of mild pulmonary edema.  Increased
 bibasilar opacities, as above, most likely related to fluid overload with
 possible atelectasis rather than infection given the short-term development.
