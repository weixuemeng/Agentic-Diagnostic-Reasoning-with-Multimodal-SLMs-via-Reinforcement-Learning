                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension, chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Rounded lingular
 opacity consistent with patient's known lingular mass is again seen, better
 evaluated on CT.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  Slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.  Mild left base
 linear atelectasis is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a small
 pleural effusion and could be further assessed on PA and lateral views.  Known
 lingular mass, better assessed on CT.  Stable mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.
