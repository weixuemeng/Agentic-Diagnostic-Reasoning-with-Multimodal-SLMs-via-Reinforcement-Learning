  low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and limit assessment.  if
  there remains edema, it is mild and improved from the prior exam. there is
  some retrocardiac atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of aortic stenosis status post cystoscopy and bladder
 fulguration, evaluate for fluid overload post-operatively.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable semi-upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in patient positioning, heart size and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Previously seen pulmonary edema has
 improved at the right lung base, but there is persistent left infrahilar
 opacity slightly worsened in the interval which may represent a combination of
 edema, atelectasis, and/or superimposed consolidation.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  Osseous
 structures appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved right-sided pulmonary edema, but increased left
 infrahilar opacity which could reflect atelectasis, asymmetric edema, and/or
 superimposed consolidation/aspiration.
