                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status chronic pleural effusions. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia and worsening effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single upright chest radiograph demonstrates moderate to large left pleural
 effusion, similar in size to the prior study from ___, given different
 degrees of inspiration.  The right lung is essentially clear with mild
 scarring at the right lung apex.  Right-sided PleurX catheter is unchanged in
 location.  Right chest wall port catheter terminates in the upper right
 atrium.  Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate to large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.  This could obscure an underlying pneumonia.
 2.  Stable location of right-sided pleural catheter and right chest wall port.
