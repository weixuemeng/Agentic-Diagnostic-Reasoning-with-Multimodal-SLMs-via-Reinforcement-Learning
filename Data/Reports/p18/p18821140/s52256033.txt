 pneumothorax progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Known right apical pneumothorax measures 2.6 cm, previously 3.0 cm. Bilateral
 diffuse lung opacities remain unchanged.  Right-sided chest tube tip projects
 over the mediastinum, appears retracted and minimally coiled in the right
 pleural space compared to the prior radiograph.  Unchanged cardiomegaly and
 bilateral pleural effusions with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  No
 interval change in bony thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable to minimal interval decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax. 
 Right-sided chest tube appears to have moved inferiorly and appears minimally
 coiled in the right pleural space compared to the prior radiograph.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, bilateral diffuse lung
 opacities and cardiomegaly remain unchanged.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Continued followup recommended.
