                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with met breast cancer with PleurX tube on R,
 loculated pl effusion on L, now with hypotension  // evaluate pleural
 effusion, infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___:30, there is improved aeration of the left upper
 zone.  The large left effusion seen on the most recent prior film has
 decreased in size, though remains quite large.  As before, there is underlying
 left lung collapse and/or consolidation.  However, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is now restored to midline.  Upper zone vessels on the left are
 prominent, likely related to compressive atelectasis.
 
 On the right, there is a rind of increased opacity as well as increased
 interstitial markings the right lung apex, unchanged.  There is hazy opacity
 at the right lung base, likely reflecting a combination of a small pleural
 effusion and underlying atelectasis, similar to the prior study.  A thin
 catheter other tubing overlies the right lung, unchanged.
 
 Doubt CHF on the right.  No pneumothorax detected on either side.
 
 Indwelling right subclavian catheter tip adjacent to SVC/RA junction,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval restoration of aeration at the left upper zone, with residual
 opacification of the mid and lower zones of the left long.  This likely
 reflects a large residual left pleural effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 2. Cardiomediastinal silhouette now midline.
 3. Findings in the right lung are similar to prior.  Right-sided catheter
 noted.
