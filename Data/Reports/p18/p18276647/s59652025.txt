                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the hemidiaphragms compatible
 with COPD/emphysema.  Faint right basilar airspace opacities are noted on this
 single frontal view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Partially imaged spinal hardware is noted.
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Faint right basilar airspace opacities could be further assessed with
 dedicated PA and lateral radiographs if the patient is able.
 2.  Evidence of COPD/emphysema.
