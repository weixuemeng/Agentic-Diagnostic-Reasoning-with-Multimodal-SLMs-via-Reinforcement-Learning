                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, left-sided crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left-sided pleural effusion combined with
 atelectasis, which is overall increased in size since the prior study,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There is also a left upper lobe
 mass measuring up to 3.8 cm, largely stable from the prior study.  The right
 lung is essentially clear.  The cardiac size is again enlarged as is the
 mediastinal shadow, perhaps reflective of adenopathy.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the left-sided pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.  Stable cardiomegaly and
 widened mediastinum and stable left upper lobe mass.
