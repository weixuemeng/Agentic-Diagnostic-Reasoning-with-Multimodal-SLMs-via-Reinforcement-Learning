 AP CHEST, 9:07 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent left thoracentesis.  Evaluate interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Recurrence of left pleural effusion has been relatively minimal, but the
 previously collapsed left lung shows substantial atelectasis.  The left upper
 lobe mass and hilar adenopathy and nodules in the right lung attests to
 malignant tumor spread.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is due
 to cardiomegaly alone, as shown by chest CTA on ___, which also
 documented paratracheal adenopathy as partial explanation for thickening of
 the right paratracheal stripe.
