 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pigtail placement, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was
 inserted into the left pleural space.  A part of the pre-existing left pleural
 effusion has completely resolved.  The left upper lobe mass is now better seen
 than on the previous image.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
