                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and tachypnea.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral pacemaker is again seen with the leads in unchanged
 position projecting over the right and left ventricles.  Since the prior exam,
 there is increased vascular congestion and interstitial opacities, consistent
 with mild pulmonary edema.  There is a persistent opacity on the right, which
 may reflect atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, pneumonia is
 a consideration.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, and very slightly increased in size from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema.  Slight interval increase in cardiac size,
 likely due to cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion is a
 consideration.
 2.  Right basilar consolidation, possibly due to atelectasis.  In the proper
 clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot be excluded.
