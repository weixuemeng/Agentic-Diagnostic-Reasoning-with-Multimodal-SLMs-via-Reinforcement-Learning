                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with CHF and epigastric pain with ileus.  Assess NG tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso, ___, chest radiograph ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  NG tube is coiled in the mid thoracic region, projecting lateral to
 the midportion of the trachea, with tip pointing cephalad. Position favors
 esophageal location and less likely an inadvertent endotracheal location. 
 Replacement is recommended given clinical and radiological uncertainty of the
 location. Marked cardiomegaly is again noted with mild vascular engorgement. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal
 opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Coiling of NG tube in the upper thorax as described.
 2.  Mild vascular congestion with chronic marked cardiomegaly.
 3.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Results were conveyed via telephone to the primary team by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 4:45 p.m. within five minutes of observation of
 findings.
