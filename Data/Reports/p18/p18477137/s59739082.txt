 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left-sided
 pacer device is seen, with leads in the similar position.  There is severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which may be due to cardiomyopathy
 versus pericardial effusion.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen. 
 There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  However, the previously
 seen pulmonary edema has improved and essentially resolved since the prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which may be due to
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
