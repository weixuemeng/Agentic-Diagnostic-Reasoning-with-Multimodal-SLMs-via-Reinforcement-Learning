 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, including ___ and ___ as well as CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  No focal parenchymal opacities are
 identified. However, compared to the patient's radiographic baseline
 appearance from ___, there is minimal increase in vascular caliber as well
 as interstitial markings suggesting mild interstitial edema/vascular
 congestion, which is unchanged from ___. Massive cardiomegaly is not
 significantly changed compared with prior exam.  Prominent right hilum is
 stable in configuration since at least ___ and secondary to hilar
 lymphadenopathy, better appreciated in prior chest CT.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  An ICD device projects over the left axilla, with
 epicardial and venous leads in unchanged position compared with prior exam. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema is unchanged
 from most recent radiograph on ___, but worsened from baseline appearance
 of the patient appreciated on chest film from ___.
 2.  Massive cardiomegaly and prominent right hilum are unchanged since at
