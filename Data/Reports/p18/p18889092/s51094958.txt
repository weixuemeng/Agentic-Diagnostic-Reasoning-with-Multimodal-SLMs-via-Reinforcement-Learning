                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Neutropenia, hypotension.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed.
 
 The VP shunt projects over the right hemithorax, unremarkable.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are within normal limits.  Improvement of the left lower lobe
 aeration with most likely resolution of previously demonstrated consolidation
 is seen.  There is also decrease in pleural effusion.  No new consolidations
 demonstrated.  No pneumothorax.
