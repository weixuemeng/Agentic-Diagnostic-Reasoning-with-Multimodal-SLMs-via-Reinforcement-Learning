                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA performed at 19:16 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Prominence of the right hilum is compatible with
 underlying lymphadenopathy.  Aorta is unfolded.  Consolidative opacification
 within the right upper lobe is compatible with pneumonia.  Minimal atelectatic
 changes are noted in the lung bases.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  Cholecystectomy clips are
 present in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia with reactive right hilar lymphadenopathy.  Follow
 up radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
