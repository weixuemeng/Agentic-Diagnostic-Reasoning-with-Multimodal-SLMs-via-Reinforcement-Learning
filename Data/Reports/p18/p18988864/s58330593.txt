                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic lung cancer with port placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right subclavian port line extends to the lower portion of the
 SVC.  No definite pneumothorax.  When compared to the scout radiograph from
 the CT of ___, there is little overall change in the opacification in the
 right mid lung extending to the pleural surface, consistent with the dominant
 right upper zone mass.
