                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of aspiration, feed while lying flat now with
 lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, which may be due to
 trace pleural effusions.  There is persistent mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Patchy left basilar opacities, left greater than right are
 seen, which could relate to atelectasis or underlying aspiration. 
 Additionally, there is horizontal linear left base opacity most consistent
 with atelectasis/scarring.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right bibasilar opacities and possible subtle
 right mid lung opacity, while could be due to aspiration and/or atelectasis. 
 Left basilar atelectasis is also seen.  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
