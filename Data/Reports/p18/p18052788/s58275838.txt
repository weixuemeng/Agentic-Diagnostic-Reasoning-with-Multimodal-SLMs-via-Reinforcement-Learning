                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Prior right PICC is no longer
 visualized.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  Retrocardiac
 opacity on the left could be due to a subpulmonic effusion or potentially
 atelectasis/infection.  Linear right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis
 versus scarring.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given overlying density at
 the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New dense left basilar opacity potentially due to subpulmonic
 effusion with atelectasis and possible infection.  Otherwise unchanged besides
 interval removal of the right-sided PICC.
