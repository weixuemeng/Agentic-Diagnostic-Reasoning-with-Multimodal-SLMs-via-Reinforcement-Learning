 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right-sided abdominal pain, indigestion. 
 Low-grade temperatures.

 exam from ___.  The lungs are clear.  There is no effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting retrocardiac opacity compatible

 delineation of the distinct vertebral bodies is difficult due to overlying
 soft tissues and osteopenia.
