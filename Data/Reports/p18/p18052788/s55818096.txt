 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is improved
 aeration at the right lung base as compared with the prior study.  Evaluation
 is somewhat limited due to patient's rotation to her left on the frontal
 radiograph.  There is a left pleural effusion which is moderate in size and
 appears stable to slightly increased from prior exam.  There is probable
 compressive left lower lobe atelectasis.  Difficult to exclude an underlying
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  The mediastinal
 contour appears grossly stable.  No acute bony abnormalities are detected.

 Moderate left pleural effusion with left basal atelectasis, cannot exclude
