                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, history of aspiration pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications and is unfolded.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small right pleural effusion.  No
 large left pleural effusion is demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is again seen.  A percutaneous
 feeding tube is seen within the left mid abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis or aspiration
 pneumonia.  Persistent small right pleural effusion.  Moderate size hiatal
 hernia.
