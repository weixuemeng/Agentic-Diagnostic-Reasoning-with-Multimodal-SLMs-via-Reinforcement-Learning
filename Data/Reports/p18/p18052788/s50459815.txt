                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever and hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT abdomen pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated left
 basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis though infection is not excluded. A
 trace left pleural effusion may be present. Heart size is difficult to assess
 given the left heart border is obscured, but likely is mildly enlarged. A
 large hiatal hernia is noted, not changed.  Right lung is clear. There is no
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is
 demonstrated. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted with
 marked degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as well as compression
 deformities of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded. Trace left pleural effusion. Unchanged elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and large hiatal hernia.
