                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough fever  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings. Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is likely
 due to patient's known hiatal hernia. Retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the
 medial hemidiaphragm and descending thoracic aorta is likely due to a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion. Superiorly the lungs are clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. PEG tube identified projecting over
 the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes without definite superimposed acute cardiopulmonary
 process. Retrocardiac opacity likely combination of atelectasis and effusion.
