                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 small-to-moderate left and small right bilateral pleural effusions.  There has
 been interval development in right lower lobe opacity worrisome for infection
 or aspiration.  Additionally, there is a rather linear prominent opacity in
 the left mid lung which may be due to moderate atelectasis or scarring. 
 However, additional site of infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No
 definite pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Additional
 prominent linear opacity in the left mid lung could be due to prominent
 atelectasis or scarring, although additional site of infection not excluded.
 2.  Bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions.
