                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral images of the chest.  The lung volumes are low with crowding of
 the vasulature and no overt pulmonary edema.  Bibisilar opacities are seen
 which likely represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration
 in the correct clinical setting.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess given low volumes and
 patient marked rotation but likely stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 Hoever, pneumonia or aspiration can not be exluded.
