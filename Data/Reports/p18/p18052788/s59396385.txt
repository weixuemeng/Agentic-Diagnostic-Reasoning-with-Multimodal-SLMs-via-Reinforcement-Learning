 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated to the left. The lung volumes remain relatively low.
 There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Subtle blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle is also seen, trace pleural effusions not
 excluded. There is prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally which
 may be due to mild interstitial edema, although atypical infection is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is stable. The aorta remains calcified and tortuous.

 Prominence of the interstitial markings may be due to mild interstitial edema
 although atypical infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Possible trace pleural effusions.
