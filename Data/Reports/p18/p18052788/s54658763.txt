                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  A
 left-sided PICC is again seen, terminating in the mid SVC.  There are
 bibasilar atelectasis and likely trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 also some vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistently enlarged cardiac silhouette, trace pleural effusion
 and possible mild vascular congestion.  Patchy right basilar opacity is seen,
 which could be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis;
 however, an infectious process is not excluded.
