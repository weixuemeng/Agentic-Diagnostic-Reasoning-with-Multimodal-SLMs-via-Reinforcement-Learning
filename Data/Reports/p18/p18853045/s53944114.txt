                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette in a patient with triple-channel pacemaker device. 
 There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting chronic pulmonary
 disease.  Right pleural effusion is again seen with adjacent atelectatic
 changes.
 
 There is some engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 relatively mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Some basilar
 asymmetry with opacification on the right, could be a sign of developing
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
