                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains markedly enlarged, unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified and mildly tortuous, also unchanged.  Left-sided pacemaker device is
 re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle,
 and coronary sinus.  Abandoned right-sided pacemaker lead is again seen.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present, mildly increased compared to the
 prior exam.  Small right pleural effusion also appears slightly increased
 compared to the prior exam with associated right basilar opacification likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Minimal left pleural effusion is likely present. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, without interval
 increase in size of the right pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Slight interval
 increase in extent of pulmonary vascular congestion.
