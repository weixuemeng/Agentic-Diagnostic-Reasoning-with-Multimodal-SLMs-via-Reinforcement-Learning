                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, CHF, assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature compared to the prior study,
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  More confluent opacity at the right
 lower lung zone may be asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, an infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  There is a new small right pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and notable for mild cardiomegaly. 
 Left chest wall pacemaker leads and retained right ventricular lead are
 unchanged in position.  There are no acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.  More confluent opacity at right lung base may be
 asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, infection cannot be excluded.
 2.  New small right pleural effusion.
