                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___. CHEST (PA
 AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx od DM, s/p renal transplant on
 immunosuppressives, pneumnonia with one week URI severe cough  // assess for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no clear change since ___ to suggest infectious pneumonia. The
 region of slowly evolving radiation pneumonia in the left lung could mask
 local infection, but probably not. Lungs are otherwise clear. Healed fracture
 or local radiation change in left third and fifth ribs should not be mistaken
 for lung lesions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pleural surfaces are
 normal.
