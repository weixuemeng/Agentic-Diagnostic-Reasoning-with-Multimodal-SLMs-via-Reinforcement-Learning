                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with persistent fever and cough.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded, without focal parenchymal opacity to
 suggest pneumonia.  Healed fractures of the anterior left third and fifth ribs
 are redemonstrated.  A focal opacity projecting over the left mid lung
 anteriorly is compatible with radiation changes seen on prior chest CT.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
