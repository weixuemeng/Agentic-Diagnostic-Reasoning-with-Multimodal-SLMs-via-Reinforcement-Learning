                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, nonproductive cough, rule out pneumonia, interstitial
 disease.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at ___ p.m.
 
 There are very vague hazy opacities in left mid zone, which may correspond to
 some faint opacity overlying the lingula on the lateral view.  A small
 irregular density overlies the right mid zone.  There is also some very vague
 opacity at the left base laterally.  
 
 Review of prior reports suggests that the patient could be immunocompromised. 
 In light of this, the possibility of subtle infectious infiltrates in the
 areas of vague opacity seen on the current film cannot be excluded.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is equivocal prominence of the left hilum. 
 The right hilum is not enlarged.  The mediastinum is within normal limits
 radiographically.  There is no CHF, frank consolidation, or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 
 Vague ill-defined densities in the left mid zone (lignula), ? left lower zone
 laterally, and possibly also in the right mid zone, which could represent
 early infectious infiltrates in an immunocompromised patient.  In retrospect,
 faint opacities were likely present in these areas on the radiographs from
 ___.  
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at the time of discovery at 6:22 p.m. and findings
 were discussed with him shortly thereafter (___, phone).
