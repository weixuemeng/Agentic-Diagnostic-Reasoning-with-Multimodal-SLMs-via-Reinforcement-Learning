                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver transplant, prostate cancer, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is not engorged.  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Scattered ill-defined focal
 opacities within both lungs are new or worse when compared to the prior exams.
 For instance an ill-defined nodular opacity projecting within the right lung
 base measures approximately 1.9 centimeters.  These are concerning for
 progression of pulmonary metastases.  Diffuse osseous sclerotic lesions have
 also progressed when compared to the prior exam, and are seen involving the
 ribs bilaterally as well as the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Progression of osseous sclerotic metastases and likely of pulmonary
 metastases.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
