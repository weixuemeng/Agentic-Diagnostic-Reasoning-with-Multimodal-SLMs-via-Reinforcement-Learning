 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with free air under right hemidiaphragm. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 10:16.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 11:12 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac
 mediastinal contours.  There is persistent but slightly less free
 intraperitoneal air underneath the right hemidiaphragm.  There is persistent
 bibasilar air space opacities which likely reflects patchy atelectasis in the
 setting of small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
