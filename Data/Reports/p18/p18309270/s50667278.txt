                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISON:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an increase in bilateral pleural effusion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There has also been increase in vascular congestion,
 pulmonary edema, heart size and mediastinal width.  These findings are
 consistent with heart failure.  There has been interval removal of an enteric
 tube.  Swan-Ganz catheter remains in place and terminates within the right
 main pulmonary artery.  There is one midline chest tube and two basal pleural
 tubes, unchanged position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in heart size and mediastinal width along with
 increased bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema suggests heart
 failure.  There is no pneumothorax.
