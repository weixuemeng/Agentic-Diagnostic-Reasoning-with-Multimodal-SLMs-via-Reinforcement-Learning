                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cecal volvulus  // pre-op
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen pelvis ___ at 13:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lung volumes are low.
 Streaky opacities at the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis.
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are
 mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine. Marked gaseous
 distension of the bowel within the upper abdomen is compatible with known
 cecal volvulus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
