                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with EtOH cirrhosis c/b portal hypertension, HTN and DMII
 presenting with seizure found to have left occipital intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage.  // Interval change     Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The patient has taken a better inspiration, which may
 account for the decreased prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  On the right
 there appears to be some increased engorgement of indistinct pulmonary
 vessels, suggesting increasing pulmonary venous pressure.  More coalescent
 areas of opacification, especially at the bases medially, could represent
 areas of aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
