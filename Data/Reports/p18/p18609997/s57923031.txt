 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Linear atelectasis is noted at
 the left lung base.  Calcifications are seen at the aortic arch.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance.  Anterior cervical
 fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary process.
