                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD ___ s/p kidney transplant c/b persistent
 bleeding from urethra requiring multiple transfusions, now c/o new
 dyspnea/SOB. O2 sats stable, afebrile.  // pls perform two-view CXR to
 evaluate any acute cardiopulmonary process causing new onset SOB.   pls
 perform two-view CXR to evaluate any acute cardiopulmonary process causing new
 onset SOB.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion and right basal consolidation are new.  This
 could be pneumonia and an associated exudate.  Lateral view shows a reasonably
 well defined lucency projecting over the descending thoracic aorta.  There is
 no fluid level in this lucency so it is unclear whether this a composite
 shadow or cavitation in consolidation.  If documentation of the cavity would
 influence management, than CT scanning should be performed.  If pneumonia has
 been diagnosed, it is conceivable that documenting the cavity would have no
 clinical impact at this stage.
 
 Moderate enlarged of the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular congestion
 are chronic.  There is probably no edema.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider chest CT in light of the discussion above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with  ___ (In Hospital, On
 Page), ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:17
 AM, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings.
