  THERE IS NEAR-COMPLETE OPACIFICATION OF THE RIGHT HEMITHORAX, LIKELY SECONDARY
  TO WORSENING OF THE KNOWN PLEURAL EFFUSION AND VOLUME LOSS. HOWEVER IN THIS
  SETTING, MUCOUS PLUGGING IS ALSO A POSSIBLE CAUSE.  THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME
  RIGHTWARD DEVIATION OF THE MEDIASTINAL STRUCTURES, INDICATIVE OF SOME VOLUME

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with gall bladder cancer, sepsis, biliary
 obstruction  // Rule out pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On ___ patient had large right and moderate left pleural effusion. Today
 the moderate left pleural effusion is smaller, but the right hemi thorax is
 now fully opacified.  Since the mediastinum is not shifted to the left, there
 is an equivalent loss of volume a due to atelectasis compared to the residual
 right pleural effusion, often an indication that the pleural effusion
 accumulated slowly. In addition there is an abrupt termination to the air
 column in the right main bronchus the strongly suggesting retained impacted
 secretions.  Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  No endotracheal tube is
 seen.
 
 Heterogeneous opacification at the apex of the left lung is new from ___. Although interpreted prospectively it might have been diagnosed as
 pneumonia, the subsequent chest radiograph performed at 21:30 available the
 time of this review showed clearing. Therefore this is either edema or
 aspiration.
