                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral pleural effusions s/p left sided
 chest tube ___  // evaluation for chest tube position, reaccumulation of
 pleural effusions, signs of pulmonary edema    evaluation for chest tube
 position, reaccumulation of pleural effusions, signs of pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is apparent increase in
 pleural fluid bilaterally, especially on the right with basilar atelectatic
 changes.  There is some increased engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent
 with increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
 Again there is prominence of the superior mediastinum, which probably is
 related to the chronic SVC obstruction with collateral vessels seen on the
 recent CT scan.
