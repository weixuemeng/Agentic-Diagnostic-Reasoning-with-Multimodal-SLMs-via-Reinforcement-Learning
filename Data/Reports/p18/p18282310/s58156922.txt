                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath and hypoxia  // Please
 assess for pleural effusions/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but similar compared to the
 prior study.  Prominence of the right mediastinal border and azygos region
 appears unchanged compared to the previous radiograph.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Bibasilar linear
 opacities are compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis, along with
 small bilateral pleural effusions which are new in the interval.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
