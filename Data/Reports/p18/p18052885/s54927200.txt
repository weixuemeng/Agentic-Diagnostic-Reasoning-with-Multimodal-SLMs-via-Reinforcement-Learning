                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from approximately three hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate interval
 worsening of pulmonary edema with lower lobe opacities, which could represent
 atelectasis.  A retrocardiac opacity with an air-fluid level is compatible
 with a hiatal hernia.  There are no large effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of pulmonary edema.
