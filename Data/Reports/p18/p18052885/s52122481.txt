                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, congestion.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  The lung
 volumes are low and bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  There is mild perihilar
 congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac density containing an
 air-fluid level is most compatible with a hiatal hernia.  No pneumothorax.  No
 acute bony abnormalities.  The heart size is difficult to assess but appears
 grossly within normal limits.
