 Moderate left pleural effusion persists.  Pigtail drainage catheter is barely

 mediastinal shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm reflects severe left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Right juxta hilar lung nodule noted.  Heart is
 probably not enlarged of the cardiac apex is obscured.  No right pleural
 abnormality.  Widened mediastinal contour could reflect central adenopathy.
