 ?stable PTX      ?stable PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the degree of left apical pneumothorax.  Continued opacification at the left
 base most likely represents a combination of atelectatic changes and pleural
 fluid, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed consolidation
 could be considered.  The right lung is clear and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion.
