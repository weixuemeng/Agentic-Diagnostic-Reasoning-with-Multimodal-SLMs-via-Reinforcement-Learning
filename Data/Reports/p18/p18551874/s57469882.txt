                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assess for fluid overload or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 somewhat low in volume with increased left basal opacity which may reflect
 atelectasis given the low lung volumes, though component of aspiration or
 pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  Heart size is top normal with normal cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures is compatible with
 metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left basal opacity may reflect developing pneumonia.
