                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // eval pleural effusion
 eval pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the scout radiograph from a CT dated ___, there is
 increased opacification at the right base, consistent with the clinical
 diagnosis of pleural effusion and volume loss in the right lower lung.  The
 somewhat unusual configuration raises the possibility of a loculated
 collection.  Extensive surgical clips are seen anteriorly from the mid chest
 through at least the lower abdomen level.
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
