                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Vascular indistinctness and right basilar haziness likely reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small, right
 greater than left.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  More focal opacification in the right mid lung field could
 reflect fluid loculated within the fissure, but infection or an underlying
 mass lesion cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Probable mild asymmetric pulmonary edema right worse than left.
 
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 
 3. Focal opacification within the right mid lung field could reflect fluid
 loculated within the fissure.  Infection or a mass lesion cannot be completely
 excluded, and further assessment with a lateral view may be helpful.  
 
 4. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis.
