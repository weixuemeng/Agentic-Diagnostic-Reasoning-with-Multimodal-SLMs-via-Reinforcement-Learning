                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Heavy smoking history, evaluation for lung masses.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the preexisting pneumonia
 on the right has completely resolved.  The patient shows signs of severe
 overinflation.  No acute lung parenchymal changes.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  No evidence of lung nodules or masses.
 
 Despite negative chest x-ray, CT could be considered, given the higher
 sensitivity of this technique in the detection of small suspicious changes.
