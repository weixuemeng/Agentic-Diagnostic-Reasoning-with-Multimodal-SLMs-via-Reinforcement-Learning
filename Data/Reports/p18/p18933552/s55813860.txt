                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Evaluate left
 pleural effusion after biopsy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest as well as to left lateral
 decubitus views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest biopsy fluoroscopy ___, thoracic spine radiograph
 ___, thoracic spine CT ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a very large left-sided pleural effusion with opacification of nearly
 the entire left hemi thorax with a small amount of aerated left upper lobe.
 There is associated rightward mediastinal shift. The cardia as mediastinal
 silhouette is non evaluable. The right lung is clear. The fluid appears to
 partially ___ on the left lateral decubitus views, though the lower
 component is difficult to assess due to its size. There is re- demonstration
 of a severe compression deformity of T9, unchanged compared to the prior exam
 as well as moderate to severe wedge compression of the T5 vertebral body which
 appears increased compared to the prior study. Mild compression of the L2
 vertebral body appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Very large left-sided pleural effusion with a past chin of nearly the
 entire left hemi thorax which appears to ___ on left lateral decubitus
 views, though the component in the lower left thorax is difficult to evaluate
 mainly due to its size.
 2. Vertebral body compression deformities as above with interval increase in
 severity of the T5 compression.
