 pneumothorax has decreased substantially.  There is new interstitial
 abnormality at the base of the right lung, which may be edema induced by

 pulmonary hemorrhage instead.
 
 Previous consolidation in the right upper lobe is clearing.  Moderate left
 pleural effusion and marked atelectasis around left hilar mass, obscuring the
 left heart border, is unchanged.
