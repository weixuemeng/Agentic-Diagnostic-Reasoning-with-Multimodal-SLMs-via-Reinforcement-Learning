                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB  // SOB/DOE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Continued opacity obscuring the left heart border and left costophrenic angle
 is compatible with pleural effusion and associated compressive atelectasis,
 similar to ___. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Faint increased linear opacities in the right upper lobe may
 reflect atelectasis and early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.  Faint
 linear opacities in the right upper lobe is non-specific and may reflect
 atelectasis though early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
