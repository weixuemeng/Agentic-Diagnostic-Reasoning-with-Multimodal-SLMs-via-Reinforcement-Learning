                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, persistent leukocytosis, and
 elevated bilirubin.  // Please evaluate for pneumonia/aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis are attributable to diaphragm
 elevation by ascites.  Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged since ___. Left pleural effusion is small.  The heart is enlarged and mild to
 moderate pulmonary edema is stable.  Increased heterogeneous opacification of
 the right lower lung seen on the lateral view could be a combination of
 dependent edema and atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Moderate, right large pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema stable
 since ___.
 2. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia or worsening right basal atelectasis.
 3. Bibasilar atelectasis due in part to elevation of the diaphragm by ascites.
