                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of HCV now presenting with right upper
 quadrant pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours unchanged with the aorta
 appearing unfolded. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with
 peribronchial cuffing, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and increased hazy
 opacity within the right lung, likely due to worsening asymmetric mild
 pulmonary edema. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, more pronounced on the right, slightly worse
 in the interval.
