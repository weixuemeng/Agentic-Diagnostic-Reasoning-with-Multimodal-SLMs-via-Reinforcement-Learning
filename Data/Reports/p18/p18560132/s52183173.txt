                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes persist.  There is stable blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle on the frontal view without large pleural effusion seen on the lateral
 view.  Slight prominence of the hila is stable which may relate to low lung
 volumes although vascular congestion may be present.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal, likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  Minor mid lung atelectasis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Stable mild hilar prominence may relate to low lung volumes
 or possibly mild vascular congestion.
 
 Stable slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the frontal view
 without evidence of large pleural effusion on the lateral view.
