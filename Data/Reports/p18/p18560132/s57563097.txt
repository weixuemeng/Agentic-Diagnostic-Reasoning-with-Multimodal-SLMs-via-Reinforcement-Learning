                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p fall, with right costal margin pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior, most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. Patchy
 opacities are seen in the retrocardiac region. Otherwise the remaining lung
 fields are clear.  Upper vascular redistribution suggests mild vascular
 congestion. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
 normal. No rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Retrocardiac opacities are concerning for infectious/inflammatory process,
 versus atelectasis or inflammed airways, accompanied by suspected vascular
 congestion.
 
 2.  No rib fractures identified. However if there is further clinical concern
 dedicated rib views should be obtained as this study is suboptimal for the
 detection of rib fractures.
