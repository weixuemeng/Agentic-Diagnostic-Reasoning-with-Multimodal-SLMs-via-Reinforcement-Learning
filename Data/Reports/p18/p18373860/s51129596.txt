 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.8 cm above level the
 carinal apparent tear tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior
 aspect not included on the image. There are low lung volumes. Bilateral
 perihilar opacities, left greater than right, may be due to slightly
 asymmetric pulmonary edema although underlying infection, aspiration, or
 pulmonary hemorrhage not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen although
 a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
