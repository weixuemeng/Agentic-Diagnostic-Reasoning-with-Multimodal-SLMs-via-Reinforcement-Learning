                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with motor vehicle collision, restrained now with
 chest pain, pelvic pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications are demonstrated at the
 aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Linear opacities within
 the right lung base and left mid lung field likely reflect areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Degenerative changes are seen within both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular
 joints, more pronounced on the right, with narrowing of the right
 acromiohumeral interval suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis and chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
