 HISTORY:  Fall with headache, neck pain and thoracic tenderness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and likely exaggerated due to low
 lung volumes and supine technique.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 likely within normal limits.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with chronic elevation the right hemidiaphragm and mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.
