                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT adjustment  // ?positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CT
 from of 315
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Dobhoff type tube is present --___ tip is seen in
 the mid abdomen.  It follows an atypical course in that date curves back on
 itself.  I suspect that it has passed into the duodenum, but has not passed
 beyond the ligament of Treitz.  The significance of the curvature of the
 distal tip of the tube is uncertain.  Continuing surveillance is recommended.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and bibasilar atelectasis, similar to the prior film and likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dobhoff tube likely in duodenum, but not beyond the ligament of Treitz.The
 significance of the curvature of the distal tip of the tube is uncertain. 
 Continuing surveillance hand, if clinically indicated, repositioning is
 recommended.
