  Low lung volumes and semi-upright technique limit sensitivity of examination.
  
  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Definite focal consolidation is not identified, though
  not excluded, as there is increased retrocardiac and right basilar opacity,
  likely exaggerated due to low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vasculature congestion
  appears slightly progressed, but may be related to technique.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, MELD ___, cough and bloody sputum 
 // please evaluate for e/o pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent study of ___, a new opacity has
 developed in the left retrocardiac region.  This could reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration, or a developing site of pneumonia.  Interval further elevation of
 right hemidiaphragm with worsening right basilar atelectasis.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for small bilateral pleural effusions and incompletely
 evaluated colonic distention within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
