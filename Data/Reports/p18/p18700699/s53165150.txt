                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, blood tinged sputum  // Assess for
 effusion, exudate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a recently described
 left lower lobe opacity has nearly resolved with residual linear area of
 atelectasis remaining.  Right hemidiaphragm remains markedly elevated with
 adjacent right basilar atelectasis and small effusion.  There are no new areas
 of consolidation in the lungs.  Distended loops of bowel in the imaged upper
 abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph.  Consider
 dedicated abdominal radiographs for more complete assessment.
