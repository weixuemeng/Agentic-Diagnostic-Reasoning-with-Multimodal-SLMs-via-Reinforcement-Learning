                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Low lung volumes results
 in bronchovascular crowding.   Retrocardiac opacity is due to a pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis but supervening infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Nodular opacities in the right lung are
 compatible with the metastases seen on prior PET-CT.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not well evaluated.  Mediastinal silhouette is normal. Fullness in the left
 neck is due to mass seen on prior CT.

 Improving infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Pulmonary metastases.
