                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal distention, pain, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Surgical clips are noted in the right upper
 quadrant, presumably from prior cholecystectomy.  There is no evidence of free
 air seen beneath the diaphragms.  There is slight deformity at the inferior
 mid left clavicle which is stable since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
