                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with basilar crackles on the right, to assess for pneumonia
 or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Relatively mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial
 effusion.  Hazy opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural
 effusion.  On the left, there is more extensive opacification with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and accompanying effusion.
