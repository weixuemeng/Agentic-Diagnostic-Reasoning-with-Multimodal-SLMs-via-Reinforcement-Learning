                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV, tachypnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal patchy opacities within both
 lung bases are nonspecific and could reflect infection, aspiration or
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, improved compared to the prior
 study, but could reflect atelectasis, infection or aspiration.
