                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two left upper lobe mass status post transbronchial biopsy, rule
 out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___; chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  Again appreciated are the two left upper lobe masses
 which are less distinct due to surrounding opacities compatible with expected
 post-procedural change.  The right lung and the left lung base is clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left upper lobe masses with expected post-procedural change /
 hemorrage without evidence of pneumothorax.
