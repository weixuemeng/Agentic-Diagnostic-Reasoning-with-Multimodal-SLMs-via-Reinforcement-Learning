                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with lung cancer and stroke.  Study
 requested for evaluation of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and CTA torso from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 an ill defined opacity in the right lower lobe.  There has been interval
 improvement of left lower lobe density. There is redemonstration of cavitary
 and solid masses in the left upper lobe, better characterized on prior CT from
 ___.  There is mild interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lucencies above both diaphragms
 are consistent with free intraperiotoneal air, likely related to recent
 surgery.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Ill defined opacity in the right lower lobe, which may represent
 aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia. 
 
 2.  Free intraperitoneal air, likely related to recent surgery.
 
 3.  Left upper lobe masses consistent with neoplasms.
