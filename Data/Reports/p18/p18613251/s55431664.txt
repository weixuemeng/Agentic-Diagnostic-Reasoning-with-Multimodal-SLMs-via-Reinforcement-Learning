                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R crani for brain biopsy desating to ___'s  //
 R/o pathology for O2 desaturation
 
 COMPARISON:  Bedside portable chest x-ray dated ___  from Signature
 Healthcare
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for overlying soft tissues and low inspiratory volumes, heart size is
 at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, with slight left
 ventricular configuration.  Doubt CHF.
 
 Patchy opacity is noted at both bases medially --  this could represent
 atelectasis, but the differential includes early pneumonic infiltrates or
 early areas of aspiration.  These are very slightly more pronounced than on
 the prior radiographs.
 
 Elsewhere, no focal infiltrates.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
