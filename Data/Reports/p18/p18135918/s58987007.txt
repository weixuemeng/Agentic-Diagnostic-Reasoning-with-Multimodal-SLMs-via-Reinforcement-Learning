                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A patchy area of opacity in the right infrahilar region has
 slightly improved compared to the previous study and is localized to the
 posterior basilar segment on the lateral view.  More peripherally, a linear
 area of atelectasis has increased from the prior exam.  Remainder of lungs are
 clear.  Minimal posterior blunting of lateral costophrenic angles on lateral
 view could potentially represent small effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in right lower lobe opacity, which may be due
 to aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis.
