                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right posterior chest wall pain after
 falling off from bicycle.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  Increased density at the
 right cardiophrenic angle likely represents an epicardial fat pad as seen on
 the upper images from the abdominopelvic CT performed on the same day.  The
 mediastinal contours and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are clear. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no large pneumothorax, although
 there is subtly increased lucency at the right apex with no clear pleural line
 or pulmonary parenchymal markings; these findings may represent focally
 hyperextended apical lung versus apical pleural fat versus a small apical
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical lucency equivocal for pneumothorax - an expiratory
 chest radiograph or CT may be considered for further characterization.
