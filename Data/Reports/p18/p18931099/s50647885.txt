 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright chest radiograph. Numerous right rib fractures are seen,
 minimally displaced. There is opacification of the right mid to lower chest
 which is concerning for a hemothorax.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.
 Atelectasis and aspiration difficult to exclude at the right lung base. Left
 lung is largely clear. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour is
 widened likely reflecting unfolded thoracic aorta. An old deformity of the
 left humeral neck is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple right rib fractures with probable right hemothorax. Consolidation in
 the right lower lung could reflect atelectasis or aspiration. Please correlate
 with subsequent CT.
