 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of right-sided pleural
 fluid, reflecting a right hemothorax, has minimally increased.  As a
 consequence, the areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases and in the mid
 right lung are also more extensive than on the previous image. The extent of
 the known right pneumothorax has minimally decreased. At the lung apex, the
 pneumothorax is now approximately 5 mm in diameter.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists. Retrocardiac atelectasis, otherwise normal appearance of the left
 lung.
