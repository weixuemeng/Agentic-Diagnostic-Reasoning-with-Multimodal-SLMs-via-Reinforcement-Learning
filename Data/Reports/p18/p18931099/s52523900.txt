                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Chest tube placement  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube which courses
 toward the mediastinum and projects over the right mediastinum.  There has
 been interval decrease in right mid to lower hemi thorax opacity likely due to
 fluid removal from chest tube. Residual right mid and lower lung opacities
 persist which could be due to pulmonary contusion and/or residual atelectasis
 and possible small right pleural effusion.  There is prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature, increased since prior, concerning for interval
 pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Left basilar atelectasis
 is present. Right eighth rib fracture is redemonstrated. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right chest tube courses towards and projects over the right mediastinum.
 Interval decrease in right sided opacity likely due to decreased right pleural
 effusion.  Residual right mid lung and right basilar opacity may be due to
 pulmonary contusion, aspiration and/or atelectasis with possible small pleural
 effusion remaining.
 
 Interval development of pulmonary edema/vascular congestion.
 
 Right eighth rib fracture.
