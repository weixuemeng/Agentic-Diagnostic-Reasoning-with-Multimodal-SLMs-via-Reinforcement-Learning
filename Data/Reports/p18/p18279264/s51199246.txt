                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:28 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sickle cell crisis, now improving. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 735.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 4:28 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right internal jugular large-bore catheter continues to have its tip in the
 right atrium.  The heart remains enlarged and somewhat globular in appearance
 which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  There has been interval improvement in aeration in both lungs
 with residual multifocal patchy opacities which likely reflect a combination
 of pulmonary edema and infarcts.  The pleural effusions have overall decreased
 in size.  No pneumothorax.
