                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with two episodes of hemoptysis.  Long-term smoker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 Lungs are clear.  Tracheobronchial tree is unremarkable as far as one can tell
 on conventional radiographs.  Lungs are probably hyperinflated, an indication
 of small airways obstruction or emphysema, although I see no bullae. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 CT scanning is effective in finding bleeding source, is not apparent on
 conventional chest radiographs, and should be considered.
