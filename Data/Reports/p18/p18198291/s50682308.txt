 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Feeding tube coils within a hiatal hernia before coursing below the
 diaphragm.  The tip of the tube is not included on the image, but extends at
 least into the proximal jejunum.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, pulmonary
 vascular congestion has improved, and interstitial edema has nearly resolved. 
 Marked interval improved aeration of right lung base, but slight worsening of
 left retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. 
 Note is also made of findings concerning for free intraperitoneal air, as
 discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 7:50 a.m. at
 the time of discovery.
