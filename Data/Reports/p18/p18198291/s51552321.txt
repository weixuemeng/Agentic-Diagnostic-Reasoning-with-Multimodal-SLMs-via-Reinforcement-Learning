                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A retrocardiac opacity is present and of uncertain etiology.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The
 aorta is tortuous and calcified.  The heart size is moderately enlarged. 
 Calcified densities in the left apex are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely hiatal hernia or tortuous aorta or aneurysm. 
 Other etiologies could include atelectasis, though these are thought to be
 less likely.  A lateral view of the chest is recommended when the patient is
 clinically stable. 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.
