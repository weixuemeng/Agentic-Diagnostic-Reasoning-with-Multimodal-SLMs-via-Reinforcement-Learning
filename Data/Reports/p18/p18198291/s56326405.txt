                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient here with right-sided mid cerebral
 artery stroke, now with low-grade fevers and new oxygen requirement, evaluate
 for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly persists.  Unchanged appearance
 of generally widened, elongated, calcified thoracic aorta as before. 
 Unchanged appearance of previously described NG tube passing through
 large-sized hiatal hernia before entering abdominal area.  Comparison of lung
 fields indicates the presence of hazy densities on the lung bases, partially
 obscuring the diaphragmatic contours and consistent with mostly posteriorly
 layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Comparison also suggests increased
 perivascular haze in the lung vasculature, all findings indicative of
 increasing left-sided CHF.  New discrete local parenchymal infiltrates
 representing pneumonia cannot be identified on this portable chest
 examination.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
