                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with newly placed NG tube, check
 position.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  An NG tube can be identified, reaching to the level of the
 left-sided diaphragm, but not beyond.  The tube assumes a semi-circular course
 to the left, at the level of the heart shadow and presumably deviates, the
 cause of a large retrograde located hiatal hernia.  Appearance of some air
 within the hernia supports the diagnosis was suspected on the previous
 portable chest examination.  One can also identify a metallic tubular
 structure, position compatible with a coronary stent in the LAD.  No
 pneumothorax has developed and the previously described mild congestive
 pulmonary pattern persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube not passing into the stomach.
