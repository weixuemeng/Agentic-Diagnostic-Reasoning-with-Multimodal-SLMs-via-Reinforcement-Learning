                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with intubated  // any interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exam is limited by marked leftward patient rotation.  Since a recent
 radiograph from earlier the same date, a right internal jugular catheter is
 been placed, with tip directed laterally into the right subclavian vein and
 potentially terminating at the junction of the subclavian and axillary veins. 
 Note is also made of a questionable small right basilar pneumothorax,
 difficult to assess in the setting of overlapping artifact in this region as
 well as patient rotation.  Otherwise no relevant change since recent study.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat nonrotated chest radiograph is recommended with
 removal or repositioning of external structures to exclude or confirm a small
 right basilar pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:38 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
