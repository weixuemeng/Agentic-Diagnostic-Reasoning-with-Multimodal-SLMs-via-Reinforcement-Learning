                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest CT from outside hospital with bilateral
 loculated pleural effusions and worsening cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  On the frontal view, there
 are hazy opacities projecting over the right mid-to-lower and left
 mid-to-upper lung which localizes posteriorly on the lateral view and are
 compatible with posteriorly loculated effusions/possible empyemas on chest CT.
 More spiculated opacity in the left upper lung posteriorly is also seen for
 which followup will be necessary.  There is a small amount of fluid layering
 dependently on both sides.  There is no definite superimposed acute
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posteriorly loculated effusions/possible empyemas seen
 bilaterally.  More spiculated opacity in the left upper lung, potentially due
 to scarring, although underlying mass lesion would also be of concern and
 continued followup by CT is suggested.  Layering bilateral effusions. 
 Overall, there has been no significant interval change since ___
