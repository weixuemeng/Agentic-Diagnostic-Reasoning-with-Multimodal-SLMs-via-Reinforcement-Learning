                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube attempt, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Signs of moderate-to-severe overinflation, given flattened
 hemidiaphragms.  The assessment for pneumothorax is complicated by multiple
 near-horizontal superimposing at the level of the lung bases.  However, no
 clear-cut pleural line representing a pleural surface can be clearly
 identified.  The heart continues to be normal.
