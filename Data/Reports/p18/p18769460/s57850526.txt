                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral drains.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral pleural drains are in unchanged in position.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Central parenchymal opacities have slightly improved since the
 prior exam, likely due to a reduction in the amount of pleural fluid.  A
 linear opacity in the left upper lung zone is unchanged.  There is no new
 opacity.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of the bilateral pleural drains with a slight
 decrease in the amount of pleural fluid.  Otherwise, unchanged radiograph,
 including a persistent left upper lung zone opacity.
