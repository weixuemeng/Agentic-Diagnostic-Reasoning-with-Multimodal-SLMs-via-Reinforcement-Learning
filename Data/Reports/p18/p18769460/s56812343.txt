                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tube drainage, pneumothorax
 status post removal.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 756.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of bilateral pigtail pleural catheters.  On the left,
 there may be a small loculated left basilar pneumothorax but this can be
 further assessed on followup imaging.  No right pneumothorax is seen.  There
 is streaky patchy opacity in the left mid peripheral lung as well as more
 focal opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung which may represent a combination
 of atelectasis, scarring and/or loculated pleural fluid.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying
 emphysema, and there is blunting of both costophrenic angles likely reflecting
 chronic pleural thickening or small effusions.  Prominent pulmonary arteries
 raise the possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
