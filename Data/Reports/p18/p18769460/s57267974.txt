                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, status post chest tube placement. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 1:23.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Again, there are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased hazy opacification at the left
 base is likely due to redistribution of fluid from positioning, rather than an
 actual change in the amount of fluid.  The left peripheral upper lobe opacity
 is unchanged.  There is no new opacity or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing hazy opacity at the left base is likely due to
 redistribution of fluid related to positioning.  Otherwise, there is no
 significant change.  Continued close followup is recommended.
