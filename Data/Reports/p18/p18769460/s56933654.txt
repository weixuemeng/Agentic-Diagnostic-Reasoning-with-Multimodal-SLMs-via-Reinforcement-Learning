                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural drains.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 6:11.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained with a total of
 two exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral pleural drains are in unchanged position.  Since prior
 exam, the hazy opacity at the left base has improved, suggesting it is likely
 positional.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  A left upper
 lung zone opacity is unchanged.  There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change from the prior exam.  Persistent bilateral
 pleural effusions.
