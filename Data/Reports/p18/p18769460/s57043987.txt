                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral chest drains, here to evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Trace layering pleural effusions are seen bilaterally.  There is no
 definitive evidence of pneumothorax.  Two small bore pleural pigtail catheters
 are unchanged in position bilaterally.  There is severe emphysema/COPD. 
 Prominence of the right hilus may reflect underlying pulmonary hypertension. 
 No new airspace opacity is seen.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  A peripheral opacity in the left upper lung representing abscess
 or rounded atelectasis is unchanged over recent prior studies.
