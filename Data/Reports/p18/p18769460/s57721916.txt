 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hemoptysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous radiographs from ___.
 
 There are emphysematous changes throughout both lung fields.  There is also
 prominence of the bronchovascular markings, likely due to prior scarring,
 particularly within the left mid lung field and right base.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are seen.  Overall, these findings appear unchanged since
 the radiographs from yesterday.  No pneumothoraces are identified.
