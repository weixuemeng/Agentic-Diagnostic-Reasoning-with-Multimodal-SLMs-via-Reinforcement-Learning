                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:20 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post chest tube drainage, question
 pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 21:39.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema or chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  Both costophrenic angles remain blunted, which may
 represent chronic pleural thickening or small effusions.  Patchy opacity in
 the left upper peripheral lung and in the right mid-to-lower lung are stable. 
 No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, although the pulmonary arteries
 are somewhat prominent, raising the possibility of underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no
 acute bony abnormality appreciated.
