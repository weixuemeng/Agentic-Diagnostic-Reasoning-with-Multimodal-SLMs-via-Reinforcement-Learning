                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except for
 a calcified granuloma in the right mid lung.  Focal pleural or extrapleural
 opacity adjacent to the intersection of the left eighth posterior and left
 seventh anterior ribs is noted.  Costophrenic sulci appear clear. 
 Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal pleural opacity in lower left hemithorax could reflect a
 localized pleural plaque, other cause of pleural thickening, or a focal
 extrapleural lipoma.  In the absence of prior radiographs for comparison,
 followup radiograph in three months may be helpful to assess for stability and
 to exclude an active process in this region.  Findings entered into radiology
 communications dashboard on ___.
