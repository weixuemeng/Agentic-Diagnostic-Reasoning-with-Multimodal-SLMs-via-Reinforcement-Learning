                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after left partial
 nephrectomy with routine followup for pneumothorax.
 
 No prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable.  Minimal bibasal
 atelectasis is present and no appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  Note is made
 that the technique is suboptimal.  Epidural catheter is noted.
