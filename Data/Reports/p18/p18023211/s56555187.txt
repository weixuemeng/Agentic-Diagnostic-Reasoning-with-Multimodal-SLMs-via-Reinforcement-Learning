                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present. Compared
 with prior chest radiograph there is a new confluent opacity in the right
 lower lung, obscuring some portions of the right hemidiaphragm margin. The
 left lung is clear. There may be a small layering pleural effusion in the
 right and chronic pleural thickening is redemonstrated. There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax. Severe S type scoliosis is again seen and not significantly
 changed from prior. Cardiac size cannot be assessed in this AP view but
 appears stable compared with ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe opacity compatible with pneumonia vs atelectasis. Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema unchanged from prior.
