                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The radiograph demonstrates the right internal jugular line tip terminating at
 the level of low SVC.  There is more pronounced opacity in the right lung base
 and no definitive abnormality seen in the left lung, thus concern for
 developing right lower lung infection is present, although it might still
 represent an atelectasis due to elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
