 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral peribronchial cuffing is present,
 as well as streaky perihilar and basilar peribronchiolar opacities.  In the
 setting of fever, observed findings probably represent viral or other atypical
 pneumonia.  No segmental or lobar areas of consolidation are identified, and
 there is no pleural effusion.
