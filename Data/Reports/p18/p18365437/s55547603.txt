 AP CHEST, 8:36 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with alcoholic hepatitis and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lower lung volumes and AP orientation exaggerate mild cardiomegaly, but
 interval increase in mediastinal caliber is more likely due to increased
 intravascular volume.  There is no pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions are
 small if any.  Mild subsegmental atelectasis is new at the lung bases.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
