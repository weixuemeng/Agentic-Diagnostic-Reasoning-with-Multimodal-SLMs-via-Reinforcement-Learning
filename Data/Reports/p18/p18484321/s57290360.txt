                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p C3-T2 decompression, fusion, left intubated
 overnight  // please assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated,
 with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 7.5 cm above the carina.  This could
 be advanced a few cm for standard positioning.  Postoperative changes are
 present in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, not fully evaluated on
 this portable chest radiograph.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs are clear except for new left
 retrocardiac opacification, likely representing atelectasis or localized
 aspiration.
