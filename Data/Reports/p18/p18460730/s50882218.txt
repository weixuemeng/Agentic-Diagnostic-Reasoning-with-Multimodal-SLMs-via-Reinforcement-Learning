 pressure over 200 with dyspnea and chest pain on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and the
 pulmonary vasculature and there is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 even accounting for low lung volumes.  There is mild tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Pleural
 surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of
 fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly without vascular congestion or interstitial
 edema.
