                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dropping hematocrit with altered mental status, to assess for
 aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 without pulmonary vascular congestion, raising the possibility of underlying
 cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  No acute focal pneumonia is
 appreciated.
