                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of pleuritic chest pain, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are bilateral pigtail type catheters one seen at each lung base.  At the
 right base, curvilinear lucency is nonspecific and could represent ___ ___ line
 or, less likely, a very small basilar pneumothorax.  On the left side, there
 is a lobulated density projecting over the left upper zone, with relative
 paucity of pulmonary markings seen beyond it.  The appearance most likely
 relates to a skin fold, but a pneumothorax might also account for this
 appearance.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with evidence of left
 ventricular prominence and the mediastinum remains midline.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary hila is unchanged. 
 
 Increased retrocardiac density consistent with pleural fluid and/or left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and increased right cardiophrenic opacity
 are again noted, slightly improved on the right. 
 
  Upper zone redistribution has improved and there is no evidence of CHF on the
 current film.  
 
 Severe left glenohumeral osteoarthritis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar pigtail catheters.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, minimally improved at the right.
 3.  Findings are equivocal for pneumothorax on both sides.  If there is
 concern for left-sided pneumothorax versus skinfold, then a repeat AP view
 with attention to overlying skin fold is requested.  An expiration or
 decubitus view might also help to further assess this, if clinically
 indicated.  On the right, q? tiny pneumothorax at lung base or, more likely,
 an artifactual ___ line.
 
 3.  Hila prominent bilaterally, but unchanged.
