                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall and confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___ as well as CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP frontal and lateral radiographs were obtained.  These
 demonstrate clear lungs bilaterally with no focal consolidation.  The patient
 is status post large paraesophageal hernia repair. A retrocardiac density
 within the left lower hemithorax may relate to prior paraesophageal repair.
 Heart size is normal.  Significant atherosclerotic calcifications are
 identified within the aortic arch.  Visualized osseous structures are without
 acute abnormality.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is suggestive of a
 small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower hemithorax retrocardiac density may related to recent
 paraesophageal hernia repair/paraesophageal hernia. Small left sided pleural
 effusion. No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia.
