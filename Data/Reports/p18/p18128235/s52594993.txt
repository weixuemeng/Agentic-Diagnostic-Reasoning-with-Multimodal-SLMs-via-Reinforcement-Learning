                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions s/p
 thoracentesis.  // Has the drain on the left been dislodged?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, bilateral pleural drains are seen in
 unchanged position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There is increasing
 blunting of both the left and the right costophrenic sinus, likely suggesting
 the Re accumulation of pleural fluid.  Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.
 Unchanged normal cardiac silhouette. The pre-existing platelike atelectasis at
 the left lung bases has completely resolved.
