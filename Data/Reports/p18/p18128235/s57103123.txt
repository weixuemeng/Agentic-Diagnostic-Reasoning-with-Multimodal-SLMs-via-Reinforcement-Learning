                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pigtails, question chest tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:23 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the right pigtail catheter is no longer visualized
 within the chest.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified.  A left lung base
 pigtail catheter is again noted, essentially unchanged.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  No left-sided pneumothorax is detected.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Opacities at both lung bases medially
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right pigtail catheter.  Doubt but cannot
 entirely exclude a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
