                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and cough for 5 days.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  AP projection and low lung volumes
 exaggerate heart size, which is top normal.  Upper mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Small opacity in the right lung base projects over the lower thoracic
 spine.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focal right lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia, aspiration, or
 atelectasis.  Short interval follow-up CXR may be helpful.
