                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ILD  // Evaluate for any interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral heterogeneous
 lung opacities are overall similar, except for possible slight worsening in
 the left mid lung region. Observed findings may be due to clinical diagnosis
 of ARDS, with or without superimposed infection.  Small cystic lucency at
 right lung base may represent a pneumatocele from barotrauma. No definite
 pneumothorax.
