                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with afib, here with fevers to ___  // eval for
 PNA vs. CHF exacerbation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 third
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Permanent pacemaker remains in place, with leads in the right atrium and right
 ventricle. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Combined alveolar and interstitial pattern involving the
 right lung to a much greater degree than the left is present. Additionally
 comment a more confluent opacity is present in the right juxta hilar region
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetrically distributed diffuse alveolar and interstitial opacities could
 potentially be due to pneumonia coexisting with pulmonary edema. Short-term
 followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
