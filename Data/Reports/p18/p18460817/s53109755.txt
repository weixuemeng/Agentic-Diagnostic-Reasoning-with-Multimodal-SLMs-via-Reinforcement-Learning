 compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread pulmonary opacification, sparing only the left lower lobe, worsened
 since ___.  Sparing the left lower lobe would be very unusual for
 cardiogenic pulmonary edema. If this is pneumonia it is extremely wide spread
 and rapidly progressive and had an atypical appearance on yesterday's CT scan
 showing exclusively ground-glass opacification in both lungs.  Alternatives
 include noncardiogenic edema, including hypersensitivity to drugs such as
 amiodarone, and pulmonary hemorrhage. It is also possible that the worsening
 over the past 36 hr is due to concurrent hypoxic pulmonary edema even though
 heart failure is not the underlying diagnosis Dr. ___ reported the findings
 to  by telephone on ___ at 11:57 AM,  minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
