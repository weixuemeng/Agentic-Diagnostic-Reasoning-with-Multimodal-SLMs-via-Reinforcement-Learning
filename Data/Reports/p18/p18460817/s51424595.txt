 new PICC position
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:18
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line now terminates in the
 right atrium. The line could be pulled back by approximately 2 cm to be
 securely positioned in the mid to low SVC.  The patient has been intubated,
 the endotracheal tube projects 4.8 cm above the carinal. The left pectoral
 pacemaker is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions. The
 diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged in severity and
 distribution.
