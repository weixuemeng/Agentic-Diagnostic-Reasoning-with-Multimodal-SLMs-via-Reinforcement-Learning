  Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a interval placement of an
  enteric tube traversing along the anticipated course of the esophagus. Its
  distal most and out the field of view. When compared to prior radiograph
  obtained on the same date, diffuse bilateral airspace opacities appear
  slightly worse in extent. Remaining support devices are unchanged in position.
