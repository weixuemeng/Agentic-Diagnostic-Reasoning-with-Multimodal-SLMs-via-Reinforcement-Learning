                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle collision with reported rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal in size.  Hilar contours are
 normal.  Again appreciated is left pacemaker with transvenous leads leading to
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  Multiple patchy opacities are seen
 throughout the right lung.  The left lung is clear.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute bony abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple patchy opacities throughout the right lung which, given the history,
 are worrisome for pulmonary contusions although pneumonia is not excluded.  No
 fractures are identified however the sensitivity for rib fractures on chest
 radiography is low.  If further suspicion of rib fractures persist, dedicated
 rib view radiographs are recommended.
