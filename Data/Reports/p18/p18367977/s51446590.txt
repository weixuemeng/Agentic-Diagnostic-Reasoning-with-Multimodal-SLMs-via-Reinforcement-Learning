 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Several
 surgical clips are seen projecting over the mediastinum.  There is mild
 pulmonary interstitial edema with mild cardiomegaly.  The hila appear engorged
 and the interstitial markings are prominent.  There are no large effusions or
 pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of pneumonia.  The mediastinal contour
 appears grossly within normal limits with atherosclerotic calcifications again
 noted at the aortic knob.  The imaged bony structures appear intact.
