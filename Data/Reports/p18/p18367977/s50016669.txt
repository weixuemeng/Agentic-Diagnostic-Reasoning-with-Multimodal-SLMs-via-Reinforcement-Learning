                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary vascular congestion and
 resolution of interstitial edema.  Linear opacity in left mid lung region
 likely corresponds to an area of scarring on previous CT of ___,
 but appears slightly more conspicuous than on prior chest x-ray of ___.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to differentiate a
 localized area of atelectasis or pneumonia arising within a region of
 scarring.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or
 acute skeletal findings.
