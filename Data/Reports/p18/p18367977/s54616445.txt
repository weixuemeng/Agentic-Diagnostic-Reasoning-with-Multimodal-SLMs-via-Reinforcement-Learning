                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, tachypnea, history of CHF and asthma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Indistinctness
 and prominence of the hila suggests fluid overload along with perihilar
 opacities.  Bibasilar opacity likely relates to fluid overload and low lung
 volumes, although a focal consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusions are seen, although trace pleural
 effusions will be difficult to exclude.  Multiple mediastinal surgical clips
 are seen.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively low lung volumes.  Prominence and indistinctness of
 the hila suggests fluid overload.  Right basilar opacity may relate to fluid
 overload, although consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and
 also persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
