 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is patchy right upper lobe opacity, is
 similar to priors and may relate to chronic lung disease/scarring.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
