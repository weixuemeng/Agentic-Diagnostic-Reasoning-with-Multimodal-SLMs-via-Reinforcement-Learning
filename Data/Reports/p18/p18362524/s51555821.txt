                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Coarse
 reticular opacities extend across both lungs, unchanged over multiple prior
 chest radiographs.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral widespread coarse reticular opacities with chronic
 hyperinflation, compatible with chronic interstitial disease.  No superimposed
 acute process detected.
