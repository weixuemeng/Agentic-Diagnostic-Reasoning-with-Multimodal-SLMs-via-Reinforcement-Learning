                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with known history of MAC
 and worsening hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and multiple prior radiographs
 dating back to ___.
 
 As compared to ___ there is additional progression of right mid and
 upper lung consolidations as well as progression of left lower lobe
 consolidation.  In addition, there are diffuse opacities, more of ground-glass
 nature involving the entire chest.  That reflect abnormalities seen on the
 chest CT and most likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema with
 consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.  The appearance is somewhat atypical
 for ___ exacerbation and might reflect superimposed infection.
