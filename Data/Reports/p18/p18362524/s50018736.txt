                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  History of bronchiectasis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as more recent chest CT
 studies from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Widespread interstitial abnormalities appear
 unchanged to somewhat improved compared to the prior radiographs particularly
 in peripheral regions of the upper lungs.  The appearance is similar similar
 to a scout view of the more recent of two prior CT studies, however.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the mid
 thoracic spine.  Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic-appearing abnormalities which are similar to the scout
 view from the most recent prior CT and improved since earlier radiographs,
 although subtle acute on chronic disease is difficult to fully exclude.
