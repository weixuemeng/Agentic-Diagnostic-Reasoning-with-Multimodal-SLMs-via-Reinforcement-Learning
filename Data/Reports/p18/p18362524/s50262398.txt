 As compared to the previous image, the very diffuse parenchymal opacities have
 overall improved and are less extensive and less severe than on the previous

 the upper lobes. The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting mild
 overinflation. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
