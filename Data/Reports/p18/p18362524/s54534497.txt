                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath after ERCP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Free intraperitoneal gas would be difficult to detect since
 this patient may not have been in an upright position sufficiently long for
 gas to accumulate under the hemidiaphragm.
 
 Diffuse interstitial changes are again seen bilaterally, most likely
 reflecting chronic pulmonary disease.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
