                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___ and CT chest from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is diffuse bronchiectasis with
 airway wall thickening.  Diffuse parenchymal opacities are most pronounced at
 right upper lobe, and appears slightly worsened in the interval.  The
 previously seen parenchymal opacities in the mid right lung field and left
 upper lung field have improved in the interval.  Streaky bibasilar opacities
 are again seen and likely represent chronic changes.  Persistent bilateral
 costophrenic angle blunting, similar to prior exam, could reflect chronic
 pleural thickening.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam.  Cholecystectomy clips
 are noted right upper quadrant.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bronchiectasis with slight worsening of opacification in
 the right upper lung field, perhaps reflective of airways infection or
 inflammation. Other areas of previously noted parenchymal opacification in the
 mid right lung field and left upper lung field have improved.
