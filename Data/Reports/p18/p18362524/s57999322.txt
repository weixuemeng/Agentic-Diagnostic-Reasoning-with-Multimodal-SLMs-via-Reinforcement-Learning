                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia and worsening shortness of breath.  For
 evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT.
 
 Interval from the prior study, the right-sided PICC line has been removed.
 
 There is mild pulmonary hyperinflation and there are diffusely increased lung
 markings present throughout the lung parenchyma, with perhaps a minimal
 sparing of the lung bases.  When compared to the prior study, there is a
 worsening appearance in both lung bases, with blunting of the left
 hemidiaphragm, minimally increased interstitial markings bilaterally.  There
 is also evolving peripheral patchy opacity in the left mid zone. Remainder of
 the background changes, representing extensive ground-glass consolidation and
 so called paving pattern, as evidenced on CT of ___ is unchanged.
 
 While multifocal pneumonia might cause appearances likely that, the
 distinctive pattern evidenced on that CT and suggested on today's examination
 would suggest potential alternate diagnosis such as COP, hemorrhage, alveolar
 proteinosis.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
 
 CONCLUSION
 
 Liekly new pneumonia/change left mid zone
 
 Chronic mixed airspace/interstitial pattern
