 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia, dyspnea, assess for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Extensive
 bilateral airspace opacities are noted which is concerning for worsening
 pneumonia.  In this patient with history of MAC, findings likely reflect
 recurrence of atypical pneumonia.  No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
 Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear
 intact.  Clips are noted in the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening in bilateral airspace opacities, most
 concerning for recurrence of atypical pneumonia.
