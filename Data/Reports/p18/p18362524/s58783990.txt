                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, congestion, and bilateral lower
 extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been little interval
 change.  Multifocal parenchymal opacities persist.  Biapical scarring is seen.
 No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle on frontal view may be secondary to pleural thickening, but
 small pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 stable and within normal limits.  Surgical clips project over the right upper
 quadrant, possibly reflecting prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute change.
