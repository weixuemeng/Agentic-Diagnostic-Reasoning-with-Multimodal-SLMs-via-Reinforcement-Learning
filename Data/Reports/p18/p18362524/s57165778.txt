                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased respiratory rate, work of
 breathing. Known h/o bronchiectasis known chronic ___, clinically hypervolemic
 // r/o PNA, CHF, infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Marked interstitial abnormality with upper lobe predominant nodular opacities
 are not appreciably changed since the study of 3 days prior.  Upper lobe
 scarring is unchanged, and is likely a sequela of prior TB infection. Slightly
 increased interstitial prominence is most likely due to pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection.  Metallic right upper quadrant surgical clips are
 incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic changes as described above.
