                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia and cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A subtle opacity
 is noted in the right upper lobe which could represent an early pneumonia. 
 Given the linear appearance of this opacity, the possibility of background
 scarring in this area is also considered.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Biapical pleural parenchymal
 scarring is noted.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum appears
 slightly prominent which could be related to vascular ectasia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear and subtle nodular opacity in the right upper lobe which
 could reflect pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
