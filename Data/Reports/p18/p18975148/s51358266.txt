 also noted.  There is no superimposed new region of consolidation nor
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Right hilum is tented
 superiorly likely from scarring detailed above.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
