                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with c/o sharp pain in the left para-sternal
 area, just below the clavicle, x few months. Improving but still nagging. No
 known trauma.  // R/O bone lesion, fracture, arthritis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ascending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated or tortuous. Heart size is normal.
 Lungs are clear. The other mediastinal and the hilar contours are normal and
 there is no pleural abnormality.
 
 Although no bone lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not
 sensitive for detection of chest cage abnormalities. Regions where there are
 focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 views or CT scanning.
