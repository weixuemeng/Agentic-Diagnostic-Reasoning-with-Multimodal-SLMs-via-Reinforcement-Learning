                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with Pt with SOB and cough, history of connective tissue
 disease and interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___, CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   When compared with the most
 recent prior chest radiograph, the pattern of pulmonary opacity appears
 grossly unchanged which suggests chronic lung disease.  No acute interval
 change.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Lung volumes are low.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar pattern of pulmonary opacity likely related to chronic lung disease.
