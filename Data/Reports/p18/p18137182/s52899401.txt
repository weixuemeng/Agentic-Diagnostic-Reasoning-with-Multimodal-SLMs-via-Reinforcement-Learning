                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  History of rheumatoid arthritis, on Humira.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral opacification is most confluent
 in the lower portions of the lung and particularly in the lower part of the
 right lobe and at the right lung base.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse lung opacification.  A focal right basilar opacity
 suggests atelectasis, although a focus of bronchopneumonia could be
 considered.  More generally, diffuse opacification is not very specific and
 could be seen with pulmonary edema, diffuse pneumonia, or alternatively other
 forms of acute lung injury.
