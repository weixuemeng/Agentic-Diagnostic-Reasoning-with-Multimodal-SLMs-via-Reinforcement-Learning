                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Positive PPD.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___, ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Questionable enlargement of the
 right hilus is suspected on the PA view, potentially related to suboptimal
 inspiration effort. Overall, no evidence of chronic or active tuberculosis
 demonstrated.  Repeated radiograph with full inspiration is suggested for
 precise assessment of the right hilus.
