                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes, though there appears to be some improved aeration at the bases. 
 Costophrenic angles are quite sharp and the hemidiaphragms are no longer
 silhouetted.  The more erect position of the patient may account for much of
 this as well as the apparent improved appearance of the mediastinum and
 cardiac silhouette.  No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 The dense calcified granuloma at the left base laterally is again seen.
