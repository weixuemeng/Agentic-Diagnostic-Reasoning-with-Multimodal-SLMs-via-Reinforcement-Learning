                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe collapse with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube
 in place with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 extends at least to the lower edge of the stomach.  There is continued
 increased opacification at the right base, though there may be some improved
 aeration in the region.  This suggests a combination of pleural effusion and
 some residual volume loss.
