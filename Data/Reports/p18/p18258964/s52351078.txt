                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe collapse and effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change in appearance of the opacification at the right base consistent with
 some combination of effusion and substantial volume loss.  Again there is no
 evidence of acute vascular congestion.
