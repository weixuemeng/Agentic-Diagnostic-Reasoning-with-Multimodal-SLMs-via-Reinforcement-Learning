                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 Heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base may represent pneumonia or
 aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged and the azygous vein is larger. The cardiac silhouette
 is larger than on the prior study.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are normal.  There is no free air under the diaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Right lower lung opacity may represent pneumonia or aspiration.  
 2. Mild heart failure.
