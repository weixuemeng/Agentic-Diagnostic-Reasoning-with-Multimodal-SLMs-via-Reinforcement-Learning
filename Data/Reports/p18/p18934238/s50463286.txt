 FINDINGS: 
 
 The NG tube appears to have been advanced slightly compared with the prior
 film and is now curled in the fundus. The NG tube and sideport as overlie the
 gastric fundus. Because the distal portion of the tube is curved, the tip
 points toward the region of the GE junction,
 
 The lung apices are excluded from the film, which he is centered at the
 diaphragms to better depict the NG tube.
 
 Allowing for this, the ET tube has been removed. Otherwise, I doubt
 significant change. Again seen is a left-sided central line with tip over
 distal SVC; prominent platelike atelectasis at the right lung base with? trace
 right effusion; can a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation. Skin ___ over the upper abdomen near the midline can
 residual oral contrast in the left splenic flexure are also again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval advancement of the NG tube and apparent removal of the ET tube.
