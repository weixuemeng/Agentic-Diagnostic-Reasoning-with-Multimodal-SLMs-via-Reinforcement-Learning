                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest congestion and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are hyperexpanded, with marked enlargement of the retrosternal clear
 space. There is a lower lung predominant interstitial abnormality, best
 appreciated on the frontal projection, that is thought to represent an
 infectious process, less likely vascular congestion.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  A small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged compared to
 the prior study from ___.  A small left pleural effusion is new. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral lower lung reticular opacities, concerning for an infectious
 process, although an element of interstitial pulmonary edema cannot be
 excluded.
 
 2.  Unchanged small-to-moderate right and new small left pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
