                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CLL treated for pneumonia, persistently high O2 requirement,
 question infiltrate or effusion.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 Rotated positioning.  There are small bilateral effusions.  In addition, there
 appears to be fluid layering along the minor fissure.  There is mild
 prominence of the perihilar vessels, which may represent mild pulmonary
 plethora, in the setting of advanced emphysematous changes.  In addition,
 there appear to be increased interstitial markings, particularly in the mid
 and lower zones, best appreciated on the lateral view.  This could represent
 CHF, but other forms of interstitial infiltrate are also considered a likely
 possibility. Suspect pulmonary artery prominence.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Suspect severe background COPD, with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 2.  Possible pulmonary vascular plethora, in an atypical distribution.
 
 3.  Increased interstitial markings, ? related to atypical pattern of CHF
 versus an interstitial infiltrate.
 
 4.  Compared with ___, at 23:32 p.m., I suspect that the apparent
 interval improvement is, in large part, related to differences in technique.
