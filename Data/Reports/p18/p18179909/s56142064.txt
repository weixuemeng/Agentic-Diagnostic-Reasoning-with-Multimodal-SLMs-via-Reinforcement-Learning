                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with multifocal pneumonia on antibiotic treatment
 with acute desaturation, assess for new consolidations or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable AP upright radiographs were obtained of the chest.  Marked sudden
 increase in pulmonary opacities involving the mid and lower right lung and the
 lower left lung are accompanied by increased interstitial markings suggesting
 interval development of pulmonary edema given the time course. Accompanying
 worsened pneumonia is also a concern. Bilateral left greater than right
 pleural effusions are also noted.  Cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal bilateral pneumonia with sudden increased opacity
 likely reflective of a component of pulmonary edema along with progressive
 pneumonia.  Recommended diuresis and repeat imaging for a more accurate
 assessment.
 
 Findings discussed with ___, medical student subintern, by Dr. ___
