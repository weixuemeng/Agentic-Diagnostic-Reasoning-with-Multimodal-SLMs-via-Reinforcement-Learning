                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Stroke.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is a convex contour to the
 right upper mediastinum that is most often due to tortuosity of the great
 vessels, although not entirely specific.  Mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality including prominence of upper zone pulmonary vascularity, which
 also appears indistinct, suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 and medial left lower lung opacities suggest minor atelectasis.  Surgical
 clips project along the left axilla.  Moderate degenerative changes involve
 the right glenohumeral joint, which shows moderately large osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Convex contour to the right upper mediastinum, which usually coincides
 with tortuosity of vasculature, but is not specific and could represent
 lymphadenopathy, for example.  Correlation with prior radiographs is
 recommended to see whether this appearance can be shown to have long-term
 stability.  Otherwise, short-term followup radiographs or evaluation with CT
 is recommended to evaluate further.
