 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:16 AM
  Subtle deformities of at least ___ lateral right mid to lower ribs are of
  indeterminate age, but rib fractures of indeterminate age not excluded.
  
  Low lung volumes.  Subtle nodular opacities at the left upper lung and right
  lung base are of unclear clinical significance or chronicity.  Recommend
  comparison with prior studies if available or nonurgent chest CT for further
  assessment.
  
  Bibasilar atelectasis. More focal lateral right base opacity could be due to
  scarring but underlying pulmonary nodule or focal consolidation is not
  excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views the chest would be helpful for
  further assessment if/when patient able.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, sdh  // please evaluate for acute
 abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle small nodular opacities noted
 at the left upper lung and possibly right lung base are nonspecific and of
 uncertain chronicity, given lack of priors for comparison.  Recommend
 comparison with any prior studies, if none consider nonurgent chest CT for
 further assessment if clinically appropriate given patient age.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  More focal lateral right base opacity could be
 due to scarring but underlying pulmonary nodule or focal consolidation is not
 excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views the chest would be helpful for
 further assessment if/when patient able.
 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 top-normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 Subtle deformities of several lateral mid to lower right ribs are of
 indeterminate age, but could be due to prior fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle deformities of at least ___ lateral right mid to lower ribs are of
 indeterminate age, but rib fractures of indeterminate age not excluded.
 
 Low lung volumes.  Subtle nodular opacities at the left upper lung and right
 lung base are of unclear clinical significance or chronicity.  Recommend
 comparison with prior studies if available or nonurgent chest CT for further
 assessment.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis. More focal lateral right base opacity could be due to
 scarring but underlying pulmonary nodule or focal consolidation is not
 excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views the chest would be helpful for
 further assessment if/when patient able.
