 INDICATION:  ___F with large IPH, intubated, transfer from OSH, evaluate for et
 tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm and terminates within the stomach.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, allowing for rotation. 
 There is moderate S-shaped scoliosis of the visualized thoracolumbar spine. 
 Calcific densities projecting over the right upper quadrant may represent
 gallstones or renal stones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard position of support devices.
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 3. Densities projecting over the right upper quadrant may represent
 nephrolithiasis or cholelithiasis.
