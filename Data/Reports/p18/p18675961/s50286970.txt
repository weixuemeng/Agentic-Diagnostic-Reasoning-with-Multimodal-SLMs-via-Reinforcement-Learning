 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 the most recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.9 cm from the carina and is
 appropriate.  Orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and ends
 into the fundus of the stomach.  New since yesterday's radiograph is an
 ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung either represents aspiration or
 new atelectasis.  There are no new changes in the left lung.  Heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined opacity at the right lung base, new since yesterday
 reflects either atelectasis or aspiration and requires monitoring or further
 followup for resolution.  No new findings in the left lung.
