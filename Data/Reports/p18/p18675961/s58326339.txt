                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with likely aspiration event, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiograph from ___, acquired 24 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 4 cm above the carina and is
 appropriately positioned and orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into
 the stomach.  An ill-defined opacity at the right lung base on the prior
 radiograph has resolved suggesting that it was an aspiration or atelectasis. 
 There are no new lung opacities of concern.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  An ill-defined opacity at the right lung base on the prior
 radiograph has resolved, reflecting either atelectasis or aspiration.
