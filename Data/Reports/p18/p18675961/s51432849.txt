                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure disorder, febrile with productive cough, question evolving
 pneumonia.  A preliminary report was provided by radiology resident, Dr. ___
 ___, to Dr. ___, pager ___, by phone at ___:___ p.m. on ___
 as follows "right basilar opacity with now retraction of minor fissure is
 likely atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded given the provided
 history."
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 region, with downward retraction of the minor fissure.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, likely accentuated by technique.  Doubt overt CHF.  Minimal
 patchy opacity at the left base, improved compared with ___ at ___:___ p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar right-greater-than-left patchy opacities.  The possibility of an
 early pneumonic infiltrate at the right base cannot be excluded.  The left
 base opacity is slightly improved.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by technique, without other
 evidence of CHF.
