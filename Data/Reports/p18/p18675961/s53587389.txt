 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:41 PM
  Low lung volumes. Interval extubation and removal of NGT. Right basilar
  opacity is slightly improved from ___ and may represent atelectasis or
  aspiration. New opacity in the right mid lung may be new aspiration or
  developing infection. Small effusion. Progressive distention of large bowel
  over the past few days. Correlate with clinical symptoms of obstruction and
  obtain further imaging as clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged accompanied by mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  New patchy opacities have developed in the right mid
 lung region at the level of the sixth posterior rib, and within the left
 retrocardiac region.  These could represent areas of acute aspiration or
 infection. Right basilar opacity is slightly improved. Persistent small right
 effusion.
 
 Distended loops of bowel in the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on
 this study but are more fully characterize on separately dictated abdominal
 radiograph of the same date.
