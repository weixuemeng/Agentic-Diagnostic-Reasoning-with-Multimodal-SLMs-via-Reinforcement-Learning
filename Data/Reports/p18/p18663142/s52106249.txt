                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CLL, here with pericardial effusion s/p
 pericardiocentesis  // eval for thoracic pathology s/p pericardiocentesis
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:43.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and
 is probably larger, even allowing for technical differences.  The
 configuration raises the question of a pericardial effusion.  There is hazy
 opacity at both bases likely reflecting small layering bilateral effusions ,
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone
 redistribution suggesting mild vascular plethora.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Is there clinical
 concern for pericardial effusion?
 2. Upper zone redistribution suggesting mild vascular plethora, also more
 pronounced.
 3. New hazy opacity at both lung bases consistent with small effusions and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
