  1. Interval increase in bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than
  left, with small bilateral pleural effusions and mild cephalization is most
  consistent with pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is recommended to
  assess for superimposed infection.
  
  2. Persistent cardiomegaly.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone
  on ___ at 11:45 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pericardial effusion s/p drainage. Now
 febrile  // PNA      PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I do not see a radio-opaque pericardial drain, presumably removed since ___.  Large cardiac silhouette is slightly larger, whether that is due to
 interval recurrence of pericardial effusion or worsened cardiomegaly is
 radiographically indeterminate.
 
 Substantial increase in opacification of the lung bases could be due in part
 to pleural effusion, moderate on the right small on the left, but raises
 concern for concurrent pneumonia in either lower lobe.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is more engorged indicating a component at least of cardiac decompensation. 
 No pneumothorax.
