                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, found to have pericardial effusion;
 hx of CLL  // r/o infiltration vs pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 21:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to 1 day earlier, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly
 smaller, though this is in part due to technical differences.  Again seen is
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Hazy opacity at both lung bases
 is again noted, slightly less pronounced.  Possible small right and very small
 left effusion, also appear slightly improved.
 
 Again seen is a catheter overlying the lower chest and upper abdomen, for
 which clinical correlation is requested.  No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum,
 or pneumo pericardium detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild vascular plethora similar to the prior study.  Doubt overt CHF .
 2. Hazy opacity both lung bases slightly improved.  Minimal blunting of right
 greater the left costophrenic angles, also slightly improved.
 3. Cardiac silhouette appears smaller on the current film.
