                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent seizure.  Assess for signs of infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided. On the frontal view
 there is subtle obscuration of the right heart border with faint opacity
 projecting over the heart on the lateral view.  Additionally a linear opacity
 in the right upper lung zone between the second and third anterior ribs is
 noted. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  There is rightward scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Possible subtle opacity in the right middle lobe. Recommend left anterior
 oblique and lordotic views to exclude pneumonia.
 2. Linear opacity in the right upper lung for which six week follow up
 radiograph is recommended. 
 
 The change in the preliminary report was emailed to the ED ___ nurses for
 direct communication with the patient's physician.
