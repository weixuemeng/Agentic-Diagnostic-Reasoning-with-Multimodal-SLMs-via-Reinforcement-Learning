                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of AIDS with recurrent chills,
 fatigue, sweats.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Widespread ground glass opacities have improved compared to previous chest
 radiographs but there are diffuse reticular and subtle nodular opacities
 present bilaterally.  No pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion
 noted.  Heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  No bony abnormalities
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved ground glass opacities with residual diffuse reticular and fine
 nodular pattern. Diagnostic considerations include slowly resolving/chronic
 Pneumocystis infection versus a secondary infection by bacterial, viral,
 fungal or mycobacterial organisms. Considering recurrent symptoms, suggest
 Chest CT for further characterization.  
 
 Findings were conveyed via telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 4 PM.
