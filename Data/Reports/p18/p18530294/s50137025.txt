                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Emesis.  Question aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  There are patchy basilar opacities
 that can probably be attributed to atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process on limited examination.
 If there is continued clinical concern for pneumonia or aspiration, short-term
 follow-up radiographs are suggested, preferably with standard PA and lateral
 technique if feasible.
