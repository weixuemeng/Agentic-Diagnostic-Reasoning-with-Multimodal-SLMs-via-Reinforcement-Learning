                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, worse in past month  // eval for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  There is slight interval
 decrease in the lung volumes with interval development of minimal interstitial
 opacities that potentially might reflect interstitial lung disease. Repeated
 radiograph with an emphasis on full inspiration is recommended to exclude this
 possibility. If findings persist, assessment with chest CT would be
 beneficial.
