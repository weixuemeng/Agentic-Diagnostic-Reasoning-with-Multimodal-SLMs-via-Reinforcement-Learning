 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior exam, the heart size is
 significantly enlarged.  There is central hilar engorgement and redistribution
 of vessels in the upper zones consistent with pulmonary edema.  Dense
 retrocardiac opacity likely represents left lower lobe atelectasis.  Rounded
 mass-like opacity in the right middle or lower lobe may represent atelectasis
 or infection. Calcifications in the right upper lobe are constant.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New moderate pulmonary edema and worsening cardiomegaly.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Rounded mass like opacity in the right middle or lower lobe which may
 represent atelecasis or pneumonia. Recommend follow up radiograph after
 diuresis for further assessment. If there is no improvement, then consider CT.
