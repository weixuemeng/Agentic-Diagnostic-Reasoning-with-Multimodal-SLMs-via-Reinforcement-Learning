                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and PA and
 lateral chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities are again identified
 within the lung bases.  Findings appear similar to recent chest radiograph
 from ___,  though worse compared to preoperative chest
 examination from ___.  Findings may be consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  A chronic small right-sided pleural effusion and ovoid
 opacity along the right minor fissure which may represent fluid within the
 right minor fissure appear unchanged compared to prior examination. Calcified
 plaques along the right inferior pleural margin and calcified hilar lymph
 nodes appear unchanged suggesting prior granulomatous disease.  No new
 confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild
 enlargement of the hilar contours and indistinctness appear similar to prior
 examination corresponding with mild edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged
 from prior.  There is no significant interval change compared to prior
 examination from ___.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable linear basilar opacities, which may reflect mild pulmonary edema,
 though unchanged since ___.
 2.  Unchanged chronic loculated small right pleural effusion.
 3.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 4.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
