                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate right lower lobe scarring
 and pleural calcifications. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be
 due to scarring or small persistent chronic effusion.  There is no focal
 airspace opacity.  There is stable mild cardiomegaly.  Median sternotomy
 cerclage wires are intact and there are multiple surgical clips in the
 anterior mediastinum.  There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Scarring in the right lower lobe, pleural calcifications, chronic pleural
 effusion/bluting of the right costophrenic angle appear to be a chronic
 process.
