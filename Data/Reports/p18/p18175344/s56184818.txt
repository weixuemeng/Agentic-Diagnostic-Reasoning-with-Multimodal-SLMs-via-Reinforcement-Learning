                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post CABG with anemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart remains
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is
 mild pulmonary edema, worse when compared to the prior study.  Small right
 pleural effusion demonstrates loculation laterally, and is relatively
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  Rounded opacity projecting over the
 right lung base in the region of the minor fissure likely reflects a
 pseudotumor due to fluid tracking within the fissure.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Calcified nodule
 within the right lung apex likely reflects a granuloma.  Calcified hilar and
 mediastinal lymph nodes as well as right basilar pleural plaque calcifications
 are again noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, worse compared to the prior study, with small right
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
