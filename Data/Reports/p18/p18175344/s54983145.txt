 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly may have improved, though the difference could be due in

 contours and calcifications are probably chronic, rather than any acute
 pleural effusion, compared to ___ unchanged.  Upper lungs are
 clear.  No pulmonary edema.  Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary
 bypass grafting.
