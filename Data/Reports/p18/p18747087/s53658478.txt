                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post TVAR for aortic stenosis.  Bilateral interstitial
 opacities, worse on the right, with enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 central pulmonary vascular congestion suggest asymmetric edema. However, an
 early right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural
 effusion are small.  Linear streak like opacities in the retrocardiac region
 with resultant blurring of the left medial hemidiaphragm is new and most
 likely secondary to atelectasis postoperatively.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Congestive heart failure pattern with probable asymmetrical edema.However,
 early right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  This could be further
 assessed by repeat chest radiographs after diuresis following diuresis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinical concern for pneumonia persists, repeat chest
 radiographs after diuresis is recommended to exclude an early pneumonia in the
 right lung.
