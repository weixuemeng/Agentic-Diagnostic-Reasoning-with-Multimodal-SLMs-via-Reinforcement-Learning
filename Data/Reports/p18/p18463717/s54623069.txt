  1. Multiple displaced right-sided rib fractures.  Adjacent opacity within the
  right lung base laterally could reflect areas of contusion.
  
  2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis
  though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
  
  3. Nasogastric tube tip within the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased responsiveness, rectal bleeding, dyspnea.  Nasogastric
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. The nasogastric tube
 tip terminates within the stomach.  Lung volumes are low resulting in crowding
 of bronchovascular structures.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The aorta
 is tortuous.   No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases could reflect atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple
 displaced right-sided rib fractures are noted with adjacent hazy opacification
 in the peripheral aspect of the right lung base.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Multiple displaced right-sided rib fractures.  Adjacent opacity within the
 right lung base laterally could reflect areas of contusion. This was discussed
 with Dr. ___ at ___:___pm, ___.
 
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis
 though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
 
 3. Nasogastric tube tip within the stomach.
