                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged, with prominent epicardial
 fat re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not large.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. 
 Multiple areas of lobulated lateral pleural thickening are seen bilaterally
 likely reflective of pleural fat deposition, however 1 of these regions within
 the left lateral lower hemi thorax is larger compared to the previous chest
 radiograph, measuring approximately 6.3 x 3.1 cm on the frontal view.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left inferolateral pleural based density may reflect prominent pleural fat
 deposition, but appears larger compared to the previous chest radiograph. 
 Further assessment with chest CT is recommended to confirm this finding. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT
