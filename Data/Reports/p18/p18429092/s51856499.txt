                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with tracheostomy, hypotensive and hypoxic. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.  A right upper extremity PICC
 is also in unchanged position terminating in the proximal SVC, close to the
 brachiocephalic junction.  Lung volumes remain extremely low.  There are dense
 bibasilar consolidations compatible with known pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour for is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar consolidations compatible with known
 pneumonia.  Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Right sided PICC terminates in the very proximal SVC, close to the
 brachiocephalic junction.
