                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Nausea and hyperglycemia in the setting of diabetes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique including leftward rotation.  There is newly apparent
 but vague medial right basilar opacity, also detectable on the lateral view. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Medial right basilar opacity.  Pneumonia is a differential consideration but
 atelectasis could also be considered.  Reimaging with standard PA and lateral
 radiographs may be helpful if there is a diagnostic dilemma.
