                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with concern for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip
 terminating in the distal SVC.  A left-sided dialysis catheter is again seen
 with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  Heart size is normal.  Stable,
 abnormal contour of the left mediastinum could represent a mediastinal mass. 
 Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.  Slight interval increase in right
 basilar opacity without associated volume loss likely reflects consolidation. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased right basilar opacity may represent aspiration.
 2.  Abnormal contour of the left mediastinum could represent a mediastinal
 mass.  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT for further evaluation of possible mediastinal
 mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were commuincated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 11:33 AM, via text page 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
