                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are new streaky left basilar opacities,
 probably within the lingula, although not well seen on the lateral view. 
 These are most suggestive of minor atelectasis but are not entirely specific. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Mild rightward convex mid thoracic spinal curvature is similar.
 Otherwise, bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Streaky left basilar opacities, not entirely specific but most
 suggestive of minor atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 however, mild or early bronchopneumonia is not excluded.
