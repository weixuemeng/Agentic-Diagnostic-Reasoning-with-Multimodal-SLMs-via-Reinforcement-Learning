                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a minimal interstitial abnormality that appears
 less prominent than on the earlier examination.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Surgical clips project along the base of the left neck.  There
 is no evidence for free air.  Mild rightward convex curvature centered along
 the lower thoracic spine is similar.  The bones are probably demineralized. 
 Slight degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interstitial abnormality which may reflect slight fluid
 overload but substantially decreased.  No evidence for free air.
