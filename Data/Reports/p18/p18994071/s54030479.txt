                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally persists but are perhaps slightly improved since the exam on
 ___.  This appears most consistent with cardiopulmonary edema in the
 setting of moderate cardiomegaly and a small right pleural effusion,
 interstitial pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
 scenario.  A left pleural effusion, if present is trace.  Retrocardiac linear
 streak like opacities may reflect atelectasis, slightly decreased from the
 prior exam but were also present in ___.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, unchanged.  Extensive aortic
 knob calcifications are also unchanged.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 tortuous, similar the prior exam.  A C-shaped radio opacity projecting over
 the midline in the region just above the hiatus on the frontal view is also
 seen on the lateral view and is of uncertain etiology but is unchanged. 
 Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with mild, broad S-shaped
 scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is overall similar to the prior exam.  No
 acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral prominent interstitial markings likely reflects edema in setting of
 moderate cardiomegaly and small pleural effusion, slightly improved from ___.  Nonetheless, interstitial pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical situation.  No definite focal consolidation to suggest a focal
 pneumonia.
