                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mitral valve replacement, now with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, CT chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, AP AND LATERAL:  Median sternotomy wires and mitral valve annuloplasty.
 Mild cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity are unchanged.  Stable moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions.  Slightly improved aeration in the left
 lower lobe, with a significant amount of residual opacity.  Slightly increased
 patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region.  Numerous calcified right hilar
 lymph nodes.  Persistent mild interstitial edema, with diffuse Kerley B lines.
 Mild left and severe right acromioclavicular arthropathy, with joint space
 narrowing and marginal osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Decreased left lower and increased right lower lobe opacity.  Though
 likely due to atelectasis, superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
