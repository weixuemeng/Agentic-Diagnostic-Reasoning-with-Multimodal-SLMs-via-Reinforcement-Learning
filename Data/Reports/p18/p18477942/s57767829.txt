 IMPRESSION:

 radiographs ___. Bronchiectasis is global, severe, and a small
 bilateral pleural effusions or scarring are unchanged. There is no
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia nor obvious retention of secretions in an

 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate, unchanged, but
 there is no pulmonary edema or any indication of congestive heart failure
