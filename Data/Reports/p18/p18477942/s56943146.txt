                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Complicated pulmonary history, now with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
 The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the hemidiaphragm, which may
 be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Evidence of bronchiectasis
 is again seen in the right infrahilar and possibly in the right upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The effusion may be
 slightly decreased since the prior study.
 2.  Bronchiectatic changes, particularly in the right lung.
 3.  Hyperinflated lungs may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
