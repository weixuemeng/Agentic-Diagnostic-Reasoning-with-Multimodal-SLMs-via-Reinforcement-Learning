                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with COPD and shortness breath.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates prominent cardiac silhouette. 
 The mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is interval development of a
 left lower lobe moderate sized pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis
 that has increased.  Diffuse lower lung predominant bronchiectasis is again
 seen, with increasingly conspicuous mucoid impaction in the right infrahilar
 bronchi, superinfection not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increasing moderate left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis,
 with underlying infection not excluded.
 
 2.  Increasingly conspicuous mucoid impaction in ectatic right infrahilar
 bronchi.  Superinfection cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Diffuse bronchiectasis.
 
 4.  Recommend dedicated AP and lateral radiographs and/or cross-sectional
 imaging.
