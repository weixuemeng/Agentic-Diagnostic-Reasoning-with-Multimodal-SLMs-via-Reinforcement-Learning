                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is mildly prominent inferior opacification below the right hilum, more
 than usually expected and which would be compatible with atelectasis although
 pneumonia is not excluded.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, probably within the right lower
 lobe, and not specific; it could be seen with atelectasis although mild
 bronchopneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate setting.
