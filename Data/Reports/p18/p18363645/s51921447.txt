                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF and increasing dyspnea orthopnea.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left chest wall pacemaker is present with leads in the right atrium and
 ventricle.  There is prominence of interstitial markings throughout the lungs
 which may represent pulmonary edema or alternatively chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  No prior studies are available for comparison.  There is a linear
 patchy opacity in the left lower lung zone which likely represents focal
 atelectasis.  Blunting of right costophrenic angle may be due to a small
 pleural effusion or scarring. No pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Prominent interstitial markings which may represent pulmonary edema or
 alternatively chronic lung disease. No prior studies are available for
 comparison.
 
 2. Right lower lobe atelectasis and possible small right pleural effusion or
 scarring.
