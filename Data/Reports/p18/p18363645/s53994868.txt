                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, increasing shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
 CABG.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, and the mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Worsening alveolar opacities are noted predominant within the
 right mid lung field and left lung base. Continued vascular indistinctness and
 perihilar haziness is again seen.  These findings likely reflect worsening
 moderate pulmonary edema, though developing areas of infection in the right
 mid lung field and left lung base cannot be completely excluded.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval, though developing areas of
 infection in the right mid lung field and left lung base cannot be completely
 excluded.  Followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
