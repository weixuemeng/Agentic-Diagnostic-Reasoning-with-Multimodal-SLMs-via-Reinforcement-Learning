                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two PA and 1 lateral view of the chest.  Again seen is elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm.  Relatively linear left basilar opacities are most suggestive
 of atelectasis.  Opacity projecting over the right lung base on 1 of the
 frontal views is due to patient's hand.  The right lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacities likely in part due to atelectasis noting component
 infection is also possible.
