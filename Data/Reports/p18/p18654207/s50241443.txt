                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm with distention of the splenic flexure of the colon,
 similar to prior study.  Left greater than right bibasilar consolidations are
 again seen, possibly slightly decreased on the right but are otherwise not
 significantly changed.  No definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right bibasilar consolidations again seen,
 possibly slightly decreased on the right, but are otherwise not significantly
 changed, may be due to pneumonia.
 
 Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis.
