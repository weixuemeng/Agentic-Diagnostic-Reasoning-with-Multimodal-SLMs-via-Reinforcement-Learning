                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung apex is obscured by the patient's chin, which is
 flexed and accordingly situated over the region.  There is mild relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is moderately tortuous.  Patchy basilar opacities are most suggestive of
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis although
 pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
