                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe pneumonia versus collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta in a patient with low lung
 volumes.  Again the upper zone on the right is obscured by the chin of the
 patient.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.  The possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
