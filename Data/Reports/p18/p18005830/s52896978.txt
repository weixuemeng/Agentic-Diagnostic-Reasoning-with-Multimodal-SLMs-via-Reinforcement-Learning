                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax in a patient with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  A 5 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left
 mid lung is noted.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. 5 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung.  Typically nodules
 of this size seen on chest radiograph are calcified, consistent with benign
 calcified granulomas.  However, CT chest will help to confirm this and exclude
 a soft tissue nodule.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest to evaluate a 5 mm nodular opacity projecting
 over the left midlung on a nonemergent, outpatient basis.
