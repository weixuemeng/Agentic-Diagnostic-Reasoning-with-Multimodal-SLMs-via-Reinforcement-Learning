                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette, though the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion
 is decreasing.  Substantial right pleural effusion persists with compressive
 atelectasis at the base.  The relative discordance between cardiac size and
 degree of vascularity raises the possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy or
 even pericardial effusion.
