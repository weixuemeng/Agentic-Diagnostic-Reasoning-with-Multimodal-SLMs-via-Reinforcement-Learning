                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax.  Patient is status post
 thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly
 is stable.  Retrocardiac opacities have increased consistent with increasing
 atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the
 difference in technique.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased.  Mild
 vascular congestion is sable.  Right basal pigtail catheter remains in place.
