                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cardiac arrest intubated at outside hospital
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina.  An enteric
 tube tip is within the stomach though side port is just above the
 gastroesophageal junction and the tube should be advanced for optimal
 positioning.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  The heart size is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Hazy opacity within the right lung base likely reflects a trace
 right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No definite large right pneumothorax is present though
 assessment for left-sided pneumothorax is limited as the costophrenic angle is
 excluded.  Fracture of the tenth posterior rib on the right is noted, and may
 be related to recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Enteric tube tip in the stomach though side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by at least 5 cm for optimal
 positioning.
 3. Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
