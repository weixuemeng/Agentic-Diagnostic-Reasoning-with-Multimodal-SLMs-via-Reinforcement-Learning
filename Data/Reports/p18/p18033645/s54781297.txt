                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p intubate and ett adjustment.  Evaluation
 for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph ___, performed 1 hour prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  The enteric tube has been
 advanced and ends in the stomach.  The lung volumes remain low.  The heart
 size is slightly enlarged.  IN THE SETTING OF RIGHTWARD MEDIASTINAL SHIFT,
 RIGHT lower lung opacity and obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm REFLECT
 DEVELOPING RIGHT LOWER LOBE ATELECTASIS.  WHETHER RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION IS
 PRESENT IS RADIOGRAPHICALLY INDETERMINATE.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified.  LOW RIB FRACTURES ARE DEMONSTRATED BY TORSO CTA PERFORMED
 SUBSEQUENTLY AND AVAILABLE THE TIME OF FINAL REVIEW OF THIS STUDY.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  The tube could be
 advanced 2 cm for optimal positioning.
 2. DEVELOPING RIGHT LOWER LOBE ATELECTASIS.  POSSIBLE RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION. 
 NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
