                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female presents with knee pain and right-sided
 crackle on exam.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates catheter tubing
 projecting over the right upper chest.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.
 
 Right upper lobe opacity is consistent with the known suprahilar mass. 
 Multiple additional smaller widespread pulmonary nodules are better delineated
 on accompanying CT.  Ill-defined bilateral reticular opacities likely
 represent lymphangitic carcinomatosis, less likely supervening infection
 although clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of the lungs as compared to ___,
 with abnormalities accountable by known malignant findings.  Supervening
 infection is felt less likely but should be clinically correlated.
