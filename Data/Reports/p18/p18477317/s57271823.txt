 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a newly evacuated cavitated

 left lower lobe pneumonia could be secondary to spillover
 pneumonitis/pneumonia from aspiration of right upper lobe contents.  Pleural
 effusions are small if any.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in
 size.
