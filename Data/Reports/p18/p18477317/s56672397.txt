                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tachycardia  // ? infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dominant left upper lobe mass, peripheral right upper lobe mass-like opacity
 with adjacent pleural opacity, and scattered pulmonary nodules  have been more
 fully assessed on concurrent chest CTA along with extensive intrathoracic
 lymphadenopathy.  Small left pleural effusion is present with adjacent left
 basilar opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Extensive intrathoracic neoplastic disease has been more fully assessed on
 concurrent chest CTA
 2. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent nonspecific left lower lobe
 opacities, possibly due to infarcts in the setting of documented pulmonary
 embolism on separately dictated CTA.
