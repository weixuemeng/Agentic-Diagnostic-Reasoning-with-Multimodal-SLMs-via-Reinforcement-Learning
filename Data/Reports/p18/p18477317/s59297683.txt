                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with stage IV lung cancer and neutropenic fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is right upper lobe opacity in the
 suprahilar region and extending both superiorly and laterally with an
 associated 5 cm rounded region of lucency centrally.  There is enlargement of
 the right hilum raising concern for adenopathy.  Elsewhere the lungs are
 clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe opacities likely due to combination of neoplasm or
 posttreatment changes.  Central region of lucency which could represent a
 cavitary component. Given lack of prior, cannot assess for interval change.  
 Probable right hilar adenopathy.  No definite evidence of acute consolidation.
