                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after PleurX catheter
 placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The current examination reveals persistent opacification of the right lung
 with overall mild interval improvement.  The pleural catheter is in place.  No
 definitive pneumothorax is seen but pleural effusion is most likely present. 
 Mild increase in the left basal consolidation is noted and might reflect
 interval development of infectious process or potentially aspiration.  Left
 apical nodule is better assessed on the chest CT.
