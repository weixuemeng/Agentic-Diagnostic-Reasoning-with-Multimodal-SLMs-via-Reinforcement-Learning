                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited as the patient is rotated.  The patient is status post
 median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve replacement.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is chronic with associated right basilar atelectasis. 
 Subsegmental atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base.  Lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion pneumothorax is
 clearly present.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is
 visualized.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
 S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is re- demonstrated with
 probable stent graft in the abdominal aorta, incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
