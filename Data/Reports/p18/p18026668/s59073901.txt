 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips, as well as
 cholecystectomy clips overlying the right upper quadrant, are again
 identified. The aortic arch is calcified. There is stable enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. Diffuse
 interstitial prominence is unchanged from prior exams.  There is no focal
 confluent lung consolidation. As on prior radiograph, blunting of the
 bilateral lateral costophrenic angles suggests trace bilateral pleural
 effusions. There is no pneumothorax. There is moderate thoracic spine
 levoscoliosis.

 Cardiomegaly and diffuse interstitial prominence, unchanged from multiple
 prior exams. No focal lung consolidation.  Possible bilateral trace pleural
