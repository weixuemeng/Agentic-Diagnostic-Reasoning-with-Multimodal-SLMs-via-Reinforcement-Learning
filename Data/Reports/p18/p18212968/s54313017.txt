                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are again noted to be hyperinflated.  Heart size is top
 normal and unchanged.  The aorta is calcified and mildly tortuous.  No focal
 consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax is detected.  Underlying
 emphysema is present. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral
 view posteriorly may reflect pleural thickening. Pectus excavatum is again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema and top normal heart size, unchanged, without
 radiographic evidence for acute process.
