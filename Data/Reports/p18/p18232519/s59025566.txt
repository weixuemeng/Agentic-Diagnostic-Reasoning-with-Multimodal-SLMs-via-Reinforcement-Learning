                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are well expanded with left-greater-than-right linear
 bibasilar airspace opacities most likely atelectasis, however infectious
 process would be difficult to exclude.  Trace pleural effusions are noted
 without pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities most likely atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.
