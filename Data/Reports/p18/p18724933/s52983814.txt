                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough and fever since last 10
 days  // ?PNA      ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  THERE NO PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 6 mm wide round opacity projecting superior to the anterior left fifth rib
 could be a vessel on end or calcified granuloma, less likely a non calcified
 lung nodule.  To confirm that, I would recommend shallow oblique chest
 radiographs using low CT level to age.
 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is the suggestion of granulomatous hilar
 lymph node calcifications.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal
 and there are no pleural abnormalities.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Shallow oblique chest radiographs using low kilovoltage
 technique
