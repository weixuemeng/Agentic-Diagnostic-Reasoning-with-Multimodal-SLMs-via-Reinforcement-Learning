                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of triple negative breast cancer now with shortness of
 breath and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures compatible with a large layering pleural effusion.
 There are also reticulonodular opacities at the right lung base, likely
 reflects edema. There is also a small to moderate right pleural effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate in the
 setting of the large pleural effusion. Osseous structures are grossly intact.
 A right chest Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures compatible with large layering pleural effusion. There
 is also a small to moderate right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Reticulonodular opacities at the right lung base which likely reflects
 edema, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
