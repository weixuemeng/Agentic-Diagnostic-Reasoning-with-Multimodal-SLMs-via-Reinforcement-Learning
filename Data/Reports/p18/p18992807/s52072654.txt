 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous severe heterogeneous consolidation in the left Lung continues to
 clear as left pleural effusion drains.  The largest loculations of left
 pleural effusion are posterior and anterior.  The drainage catheter sits at
 the base of the lung where there is less pleural fluid today than before. If
 there is a need to assess multiple lung nodules with chest CT scanning study
 should be performed after the left hemithorax is fully drained. Heart size is
 normal. A right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends in the
 mid to low SVC. No pneumothorax.
