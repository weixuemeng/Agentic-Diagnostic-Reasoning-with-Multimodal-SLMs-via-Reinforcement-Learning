                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is probably normal. Full mediastinal contours difficult to evaluate
 as is the left hilus.  The right hilar contour is grossly unremarkable.  Left
 greater than right pulmonary opacities are redemonstrated corresponding to
 areas of loculated pleural effusion and metastatic lesions. There appears to
 be increased loculated pleural effusion component in the left upper lobe with
 compressive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Redemonstration of left greater than right opacities representing combination
 of loculated pleural effusion and metastatic lesions. Increased loculated
 fluid component in the left upper lobe. Concurrent pneumonia cannot be
 excluded providing the appropriate clinical context.
