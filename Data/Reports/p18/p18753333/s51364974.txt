                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, who
 presents for evaluation of right-sided pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___ and chest PA and lateral from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Again seen are bilateral atelectatic changes as well as
 evidence of a mild right-sided pleural effusion.  There is also evidence of
 bilateral pulmonary venous congestion.  There are some new focal opacities in
 the left lower lung base.  Although this most likely may represent
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may represent early
 consolidation.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left lower opacification likely secondary to atelectasis;
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting, may represent early
 consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 These findings were discussed with NP ___ by Dr. ___
 by telephone, at 5pm on the day of the exam.
