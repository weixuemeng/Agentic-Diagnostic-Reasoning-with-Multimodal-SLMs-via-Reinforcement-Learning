                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous, and demonstrates mild
 calcification.  Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable. 
 Calcified pleural plaques are noted bilaterally.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 with flattening of the diaphragms.  Linear opacities within the lung bases
 likely reflect scarring or chronic changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
