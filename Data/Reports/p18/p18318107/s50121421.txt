                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ as well a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, presenting with shortness of breath, question
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated which is likely related to underlying COPD.  The right upper
 lobe nodule or opacity seen on prior CT is evident in the right upper lobe
 projecting over the right fifth posterior rib arch.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs, compatible with COPD.  Nodular opacity
 projecting over the right posterior fifth rib, better assessed on prior CT.
