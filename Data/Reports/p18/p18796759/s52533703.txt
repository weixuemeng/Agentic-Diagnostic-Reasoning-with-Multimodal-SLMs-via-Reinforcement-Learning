 HISTORY:  Fever, mild cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a subtle increase in opacity at the medial right lung base seen on
 the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view, most likely relates
 to atelectasis although an early infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and unremarkable.
