                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancolitis, history of positive PPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Biapical scarring is moderate
 greater on the right with rightward mediastinal shift; possibly representing
 the sequelae of prior TB.  There is loss of parenchymal architecture in the
 upper lung fields suggestive of emphysema.  Lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No evidence of active tuberculous
 involvement.  Emphysema.
