                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours. Assymetric right apical thickening
 present. Otherwise, lungs are clear, though there is a relative hyperlucency
 of the bilateral upper lungs suggesting emphysema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute process. Assymetric right apical thickening.  If patient
 has symptoms to lesion within this region (ie. arm pain), recommend further
 evaluation with CT.  In abscence of symptoms, could be further evaluated with
 conventional radiographs and/or comparison with prior studies.
