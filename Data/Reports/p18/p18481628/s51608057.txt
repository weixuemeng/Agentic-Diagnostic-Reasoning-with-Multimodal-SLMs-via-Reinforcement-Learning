                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with Crohn's disease, small bowel obstruction, NG
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New NG tube is too proximal in the stomach and has just barely made it past
 the gastroesophageal junction, suggest advancing 10 cm.
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Aortic
 knob is more prominent than ___, this could be related to the AP technique vs
 real dilation of the aorta.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  NG tube is too proximal in the stomach.  Suggest advancing it for 10 cm.
 2.  Widening of the aortic knob could be due to the technique.  Suggest
 repeating a PA and lateral chest x-ray when possible to rule out real dilation
 of the aorta.  
 
 This will have been discussed with Dr. ___.
