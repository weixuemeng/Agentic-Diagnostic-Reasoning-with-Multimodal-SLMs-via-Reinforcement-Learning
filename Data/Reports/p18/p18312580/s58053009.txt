                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no interstitial edema.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is chronic and unlikely to represent effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Hyperinflation is
 suggestive of COPD.
