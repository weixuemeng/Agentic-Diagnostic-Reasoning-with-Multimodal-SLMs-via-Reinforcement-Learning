                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumonia treated back in ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened suggesting COPD.  Previously
 seen opacities in the lungs bilaterally have resolved.  Though there are
 remaining chronic bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe and lingula better
 seen in prior CTs, there are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes are present in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolved acute infectious process.  Remaining chronic bronchiectasis as
 described above.
 2.  Probably COPD.
