                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and is accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and increase in basilar interstitial opacities. 
 Additionally, a confluent right infrahilar opacity is new.  There are no
 pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild CHF.
 
 2.  Confluent right infrahilar opacity, which could reflect either
 asymmetrical edema or developing infection.  Followup radiograph may be
 helpful in this regard.
 
 3.  Worsening basilar lung opacities, probably due to interstitial edema
 superimposed upon known chronic airways disease.  Attention to this area at
 the time of followup chest x-ray is recommended as well.
