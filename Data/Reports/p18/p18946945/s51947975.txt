                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left, and compared to the prior study from ___.
 There is mild right basilar atelectasis with no evidence of right lower lobe
 collapse.  The remainder of the right lung and the left lung are clear. 
 Cardiac size is mildly enlarged, likely due to portable technique.  Hilar and
 mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Clear lungs with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is new since the
 prior radiograph from ___, and may represent phrenic nerve injury, or an
 intra-abdominal process resulting in elevation of the hemidiaphragm.
