                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  There is new retrocardiac opacification and
 possibly a very small right-sided pleural effusion.  A small subpulmonic
 effusion on the left is also possible. A cavitary lesion persists in the left
 upper lobe although not optimally assessed.  Ground glass opacities noted
 recently in the right upper lobe are not likely to be well appreciated on
 portable radiography.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but poorly visualized cavity lesion in the left upper lobe.  New
 left basilar opacity, typical for atelectasis, although developing pneumonia
 is possible.  Probably small effusions.
