                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Swelling around right chest wall sarcoma resection site, please
 evaluate chest wall operative site.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ and CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest AP radiograph demonstrates surgical clips and a draing
 overlying the right chest wall at the recent operative site.  Interval
 placement of a right-sided drain noted.  Ground-glass opacities are present
 throughout the right lung.  These findings in conjunction with an elevated
 right hemidiaphragm and rightward shift of the mediastinum are suggestive of 
 fibrosis and scarring due to radiation, however, cannot definitively excluded
 an infectious process in the appropriate clinical settings.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax evident.  Mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours
 are normal.  No osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity throughout much of the right lung with associated
 signs of volume loss may indicate scarring, likely due to radiation and
 overlying soft tissue changes; however, cannot exclude infectious process in
 the appropriate clinical setting, although doubted within the lungs.  No
 osseous abnormality is identified.  For evaluation of operative site, chest CT
 could be helpful if clinically indicated.
