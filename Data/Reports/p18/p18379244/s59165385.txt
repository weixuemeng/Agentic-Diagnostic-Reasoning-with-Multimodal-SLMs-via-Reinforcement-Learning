                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post left-sided ICD placement.  Assess
 position of lead and for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Cardiac MRI from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  ICD generator overlies the left chest wall.
 The single lead is intact with the tip projecting over the expected location
 of the right ventricle.  No post-procedural pneumothorax is evident.  Mild
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is secondary to small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Associated basilar atelectasis is likely.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to
 prior cardiac MRI examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New ICD lead in expected position.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and probable atelectasis.
 3.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly
