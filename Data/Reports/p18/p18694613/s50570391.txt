                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with chronic elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  Hilar contours are normal, and pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Linear opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis
 and/ or scarring without focal consolidation.  Hyperinflation of the lungs
 persists, suggestive of COPD.  Blunting of the left hemidiaphragm posteriorly
 suggests a small left pleural effusion, new in the interval.  There are
 moderate degenerative changes noted throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of small left pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 and/or scarring.
