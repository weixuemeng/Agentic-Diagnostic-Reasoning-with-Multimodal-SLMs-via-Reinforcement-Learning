                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Evaluation is slightly limited due to lordotic positioning.  Moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Previous pattern of pulmonary edema has
 improved with only minimal residual vascular congestion noted.  Retrocardiac
 patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacification may reflect atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, improved from the prior exam.
