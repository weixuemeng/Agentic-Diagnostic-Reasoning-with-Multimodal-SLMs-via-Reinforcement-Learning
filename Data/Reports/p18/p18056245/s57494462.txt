                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, chest pain  // evaluate for pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval progression of left basilar opacity, compatible with increased size
 of pleural effusion and progressive compressive atelectasis.  A right pleural
 effusion is small, but also increased over the interval.  A heterogeneous
 opacity is seen in the right base.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heterogeneous right basilar opacity likely represents recurrent aspiration.
 Superimposed infection is not excluded.
 2. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis
 have increased in size over the interval.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated impression was discussed with Dr. ___, by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:58 AM, 5 minutes after
