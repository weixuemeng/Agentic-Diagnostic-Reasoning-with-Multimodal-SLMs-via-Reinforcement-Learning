 present.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis,
 but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  There is likely a small left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Marked degenerative changes
 of the left glenohumeral joint are present.  There are moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
