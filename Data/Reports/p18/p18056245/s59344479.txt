                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac left
 base is opacified, which could be due to prominent vessels with fluid
 overload, although underlying atelectasis and small effusion may be present,
 although no evidence of effusion is substantiated on the lateral view. 
 Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarge.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Right mid to upper lung nodular opacity measuring
 approximately 9 mm is again seen, not enlarged in size since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Stable right mid to upper lung nodular
 opacity.
