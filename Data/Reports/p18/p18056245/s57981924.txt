                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest wall pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse opacities extending from the hila are consistent with mild
 edema.  Additionally, there is moderate cardiomegaly.  Retrocardiac opacity on
 the frontal radiograph is not confirmed on the lateral.  No definite
 consolidation is seen.  There are likely bilateral small pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax.  A density in the right mid thorax likely corresponds to a
 known right upper lobe pulmonary nodule not well evaluated by radiograph;
 however, appears grossly stable.  No displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.  Post-diuresis
 radiographs recommended to exclude underlying infection.
 
 2.  Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule not well evaluated by radiographs;
 however, a nodule was present in a similar position on the CT of ___.
