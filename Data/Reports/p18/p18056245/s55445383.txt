 LLQ.  // CXR: Eval for pleural effusion or acute process. CT Abd/Pelvis: Eval
 for ischemic colitis

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities superimposed on chronic increased interstitial
 markings more superiorly.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities, degenerative changes seen at the AC and
 glenohumeral joints bilaterally.

 Chronic interstitial process, potentially due to edema or other interstitial
 process.  More dense bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis although
 superimposed infection would be possible, particularly on the right.
