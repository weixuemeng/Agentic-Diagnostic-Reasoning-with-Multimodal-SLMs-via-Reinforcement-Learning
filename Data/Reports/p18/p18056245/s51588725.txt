                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with lower extremity swelling and
 chest pain.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.  PA and
 lateral chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral, left worse than right lower lobe opacities with blurring of the
 diaphragm silhouettes could be a combination of edema and/or
 infection/aspiration.  Prominence of the interstitium may correspond to a
 component of chronic interstitial changes noted on the prior head CT as well
 as edema and/or infection.  The heart remains enlarged.  The descending
 thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous.  No evidence of a pneumothorax.  The
 thoracic spine is severely curved to the right, likely reflecting a degree is
 scoliosis and positional changes.  This results in slight distortion of the
 chest cage and altered appearance of the changes in the hemithorax.  No large
 pleural effusion but there may be a small left pleural effusion.  Degenerative
 changes in both glenohumeral joints as well as the left acromioclavicular
 joint are severe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings consistent with volume overload and/or heart failure.
 2.  Sequelae of chronic aspiration and/or concurrent infection is possible in
 the appropriate clinical situation.
