  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process, although early pneumonia is
  difficult to exclude in the setting of extensive chronic bibasilar
  interstitial changes.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, chronic interstitial lung disease, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___
 and chest CT dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar interstitial opacities are similar to multiple prior studies with
 decreased lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding compared with the
 immediate prior study.  There is no definite focal consolidation to suggest
 interval pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process, although new superimposed pneumonia
 is difficult to exclude in the setting of extensive chronic bibasilar
 interstitial changes.
