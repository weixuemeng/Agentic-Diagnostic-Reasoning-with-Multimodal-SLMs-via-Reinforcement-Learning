                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bibasilar rales and dropping sats.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided. 
 Comparison is also made with same date CT abdomen and pelvis.  There is mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Coarsened reticular markings could reflect chronic
 interstitial disease.  The possibility of mild pulmonary interstitial edema is
 not excluded.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal
 contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, mild interstitial coarsening, which could
 represent interstitial lung disease or possibly mild interstitial edema.
