                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, and CTA
 chest ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Compared with the most recent chest
 radiographs, the lungs appear more aerated and expanded, with continued
 improvement in previously described interstitial pulmonary edema.  There has
 been improvement in the left lung basal atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusions are identified.  No new focal consolidation to be concerning for
 pneumonia identified.  Increased basilar interstitial lung markings may be due
 to chronic pulmonary interstitial abnormality, as described on the recent CT
 chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No new focal consolidation to be concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2.  There has been continued improvement, but persistence, of the known
 pulmonary edema since ___.
 
 3.  Persistent increased basilar interstitial lung markings are likely due to
 chronic pulmonary interstitial abnormality, as described on the recent CT
