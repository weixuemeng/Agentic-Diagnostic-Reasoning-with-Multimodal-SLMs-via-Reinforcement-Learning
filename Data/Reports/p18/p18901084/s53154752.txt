                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia on the right, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive right
 predominantly peripheral pneumonia has not changed in appearance and severity.
 There is unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small pleural
 effusion on the right.  The right lower hilus opacity has minimally increased
 in extent.  The heart and the left lung are unremarkable.  Unchanged right
 Port-A-Cath.
