                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right Port-A-Cath
 tip terminating in mid SVC.  There is persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and plate-like atelectasis at the right base.  Subtle opacity in
 periphey of right lung may represent pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
 There is a small right pleural effusion and a moderate pericardial effusion is
 seen on subsequent CT.  Calcifications of the aortic arch are noted.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right peripheral opacity compatible with pneumonia.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
