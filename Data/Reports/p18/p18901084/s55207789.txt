 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Lung carcinoma, hypoxia, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with minimal basilar
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion.  Unremarkable left lung.  No
 evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  The known paracardial cavitary mass
 in the right lower lobe, adjacent to the right heart border, documented on a
 CT examination from ___, is causing blunting of the medial aspect
 of the right lung base.  However, the cavitary aspect of the lesion is not
 appreciated on today's radiograph.
