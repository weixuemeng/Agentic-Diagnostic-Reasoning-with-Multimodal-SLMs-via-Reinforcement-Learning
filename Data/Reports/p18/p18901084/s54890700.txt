                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Chest mass.  Worsening hypoxia.  Question obstructive pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 No interval change in elevation of the right lung base due to combination of
 subpulmonic pleural effusion, elevation of the hemidiaphragm, and atelectasis
 in the middle and lower lobes.  Review of the chest CT scan on ___ showed no reason to expect bronchial obstruction and post-obstructive
 pneumonia.  Instead it showed a cavitated mass alongside the right heart
 border.  Left lung and right upper lung are clear.  The heart is not enlarged.
