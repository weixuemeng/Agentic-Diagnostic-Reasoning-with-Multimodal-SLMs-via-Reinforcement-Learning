                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with lung cancer and hypoxia.  Assess for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph was obtained.  New opacification is seen
 predominantly in the right upper lobe; however, on this single view
 involvement of the middle or lower lobes would be difficult to exclude. 
 Port-A-Cath is seen in place.  Left lung is relatively clear.  Small right
 pleural effusion is seen.  The heart is normal in size with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe pneumonia with equivocal involvement of lower
 and middle lobes with small accompanying parapneumonic effusion.
