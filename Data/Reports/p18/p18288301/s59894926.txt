                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with CLL and chest discomfort as well as
 crackles and rhonchi on exam.  Question aspiration versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates mildly prominent
 cardiac silhouette, likely accentuated by AP technique.  There is minimal
 perihilar vascular engorgement without frank edema.  Distal portion of the
 left greater than right lower lobe opacities could represent either coalescent
 atelectasis or consolidation, potentially aspiration.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasilar opacities with small pleural effusions, in
 the appropriate clinical setting could represent aspiration, alternatively
 confluent atelectasis.
