 AP CHEST, 11:32 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with questionable aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 10:16 a.m.:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lung is new since earlier in
 the day.  Although this could always represent asymmetric edema, it is more
 concerning for early pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and left
 lower lobe consolidation, probably atelectasis unchanged.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart size normal.
