                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, evaluate for new infiltrate or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low, resulting
 in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  There are scattered areas of
 linear atelectasis within both lungs.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours and hilar structures are unremarkable.
