                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of worsening mucus production and
 blood streaks. Assess for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral view suggests minimal bronchiectasis in the superior
 segment of one of the lower lobes, which may have been present previously. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal contour are normal. Full left and
 main pulmonary artery junction is normal for this patient, and unchanged. No
 bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible limited bronchiectasis in one lower lobe superior
 segment. The only way to verify this would be Chest CT. No pneumonia.
