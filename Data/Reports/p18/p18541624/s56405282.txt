                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  New heterogeneous right
 infrahilar opacity is consistent with lower lobe pneumonia. Some right pleural
 effusion may be present although the basal pleural interface reflects the
 normal contour. An apparent bulge in the mid portion of the right basal
 interface seen on the lateral view, is actually superimposition of the stomach
 and splenic flexure. Widening of the mediastinum and obliteration of the right
 p;aratracheal stripe could be due to adenopathy or fat deposition.  Heart size
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia. Possible mediastinal adenopathy. Repeat
 radiographs are a necessity in no more than 4 weeks, sooner if the clinical
 situation deteriorates.
