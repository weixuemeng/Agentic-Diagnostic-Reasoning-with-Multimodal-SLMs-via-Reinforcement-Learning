                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a history of lung cancer presenting with chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made with a chest radiograph dated ___,
 for ___, medical record number ___, clip number ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a hazy, heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe
 which may represent infection, tumor infiltration, atelectasis, or a
 combination of all three.  Widening of the mediastinum is caused by the
 patient's known malignancy.  The left lung and upper right lung are mostly
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right pleural effusion is undoubtedly
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity is likely a combination of tumor
 infiltration, atelectasis, and infection cannot be rule out.  This area will
 be further evaluated on the subsequent CT angiogram.
