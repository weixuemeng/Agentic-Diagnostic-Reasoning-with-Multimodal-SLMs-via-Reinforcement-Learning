                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer, palliative care with
 increasing shortness of breath.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is large right paratracheal
 and anterior mediastinal densitiy compatible with known malignant adenopathy. 
 There is persistent right basilar opacity likely due to combination of
 atelectasis and potentially superimposed consolidation.  The left lung remains
 grossly clear of new consolidation with persistent likely malignant suprahilar
 nodule.   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.  Significant mediastinal adenopathy.  Right
 basilar opacity likely due to a combination of atelectasis although
 superimposed infection is not excluded.  Is similar in appearance compared to
 prior.  No new region of consolidation.
