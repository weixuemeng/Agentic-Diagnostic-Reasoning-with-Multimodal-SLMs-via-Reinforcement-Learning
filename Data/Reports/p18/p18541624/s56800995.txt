                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Multiple skin lumps without known cancer, question
 metastatic disease.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  On the first view
 of the series, there is an abnormal convex contour along the right mediastinal
 border which could reflect the presence of lymphadenopathy.  However, the
 second frontal view provided does not demonstrate this contour abnormality and
 therefore findings are of unclear significance.  Consider repeat study with
 more optimal technique to further assess.  No definite signs of pneumonia or
 CHF.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Abnormal mediastinal contour along the right margin on the first
 view of the series. Recommend repeat CXR with optimized positioning.
