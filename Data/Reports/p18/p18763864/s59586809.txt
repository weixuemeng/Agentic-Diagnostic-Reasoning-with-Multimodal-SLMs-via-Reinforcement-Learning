                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of blood malignancy with h/o bleo and XRT, question a new or
 worsening infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided indwelling catheter, with tip over distal SVC/RA
 junction.  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is extensive alveolar opacity throughout the right lung, somewhat
 denser in the mid and lower zones, with pleural thickening at the right lung
 apex.  Also again seen is increased opacity surrounding the left hilum with a
 small focal opacity at the left base and a small amount of left apical pleural
 thickening.  Allowing for these abnormalities, the left lung is grossly clear
 without CHF.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive abnormalities in both lungs, without significant change
 compared with ___.  No new area involvement and no gross effusion
 identified.  No CHF.
