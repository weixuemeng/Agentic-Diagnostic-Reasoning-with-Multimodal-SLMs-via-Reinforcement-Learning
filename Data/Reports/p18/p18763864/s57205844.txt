                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough and fever, lymphadenopathy
 with enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  There exists a marked
 enlargement of the mid and superior mediastinal structures surrounding the
 lower portion of the trachea and bifurcation without evidence of significant
 constriction.  On the frontal view, large rounded structure occupies the
 right-sided tracheobronchial angle and reaches up to the level of the
 clavicles.  On the left side, there are even larger nodular densities
 apparently surrounding the rather normal-sized aortic arch and extending into
 the left hilar region.  The lateral view discloses clearly that these masses
 are mostly oriented in the anterior mediastinal region.  Although the central
 portion of the pulmonary vasculature is obscured, appearance of the pulmonary
 vessels in the periphery of the lung are rather unremarkable and there is no
 evidence of any acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate.  Pleural spaces are
 also free without evidence of blunting in either lateral or posterior pleural
 sinuses and no evidence of pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
 
 There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral mediastinal masses, otherwise unremarkable chest
 examination.  The findings are strongly suggesting lymphoma.  In the
 differential diagnosis, one may also consider thymoma as the masses have an
 anterior location on the lateral view.
