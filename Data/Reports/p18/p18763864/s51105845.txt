                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now with fever, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  The lungs are well
 aerated without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Bulky, abnormal mediastinal contours
 are unchanged bilaterally, compatible with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy
 related to the patient's known lymphoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
