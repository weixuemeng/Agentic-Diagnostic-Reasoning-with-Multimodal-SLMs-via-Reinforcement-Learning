 is unchanged in extent and severity.
 
 Unchanged bilateral small areas of atelectasis, right more than left. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged course and position of
 the left pectoral Port-A-Cath.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities
 suggesting pneumonia.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
