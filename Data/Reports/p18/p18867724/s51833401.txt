                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Advanced cervical and ovarian cancer, chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are large bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral lower lobe
 alveolar infiltrates, pulmonary vascular redistribution, and ill-defined
 vasculature consistent with fluid overload.  An underlying infectious
 infiltrate in the lower lobes cannot be excluded.  Compared to the prior
 study, the effusions and lower lobe infiltrates are worse.  Pigtail catheter
 on the left is unchanged.  There is a small left pneumothorax.
