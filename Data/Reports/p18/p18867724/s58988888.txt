                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification
 bilaterally consistent with pleural effusions, more prominent on the right. 
 The region of the azygos vein is somewhat more prominent than on the previous
 study, raising the possibility of some right-sided heart failure.  There is
 minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The upper zones are clear.  
 
 Port-A-Cath remains in place.
