                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left pigtail thoracentesis, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, at ___, earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Again
 seen left porta catheter, terminating in the right atrium.  There has been
 interval placement of a left-sided chest pigtail catheter with interval
 significant decrease in left pleural effusion with possible only a small
 amount remaining.  There has been significant interval decrease in left base
 opacity with mild haziness at the left base remaining, which may relate to
 underlying small pleural effusion and atelectasis, attention at followup.  A
 new small left apical pneumothorax is seen.
 Right basilar opacity persists, likely due to pleural effusion and atelectasis
 with possible underlying consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New small left apical pneumothorax status post placement of left chest
 pigtail catheter.  The finding was made at the time of the interpretation of
 the study with a page placed at to Dr. ___ at 10:22 p.m. with call
 back 10 minutes thereafter and findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at
 10:32 PM via telephone.
 
 2.  Significant interval decrease in the left pleural effusion.  Persistent
 right basilar opacity.
