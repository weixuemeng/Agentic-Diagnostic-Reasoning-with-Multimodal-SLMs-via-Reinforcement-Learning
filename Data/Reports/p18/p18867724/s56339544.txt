                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post thoracentesis.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Small left pleural effusion has markedly decreased.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Partially imaged there is a pigtail catheter in the base of the
 left hemithorax.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with adjacent
 opacities is unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Left
 Port-A-Cath tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
