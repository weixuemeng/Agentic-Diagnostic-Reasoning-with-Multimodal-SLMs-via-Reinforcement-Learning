                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, advanced cervical cancer,
 abdominal pain, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen terminating in the deep right atrium.  Since
 the prior study, there has been interval increase in bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar opacities which may relate to effusions and
 atelectasis with possible underlying consolidation.  Perihilar opacities are
 seen which may be due to underlying pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not well assessed due to the bibasilar opacities.  The mediastinal contours
 are similar given lower lung volumes.
