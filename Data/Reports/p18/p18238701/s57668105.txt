                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post lung fiducial marker placement, evaluate for possible
 pneumothorax, patient in radiology care unit.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Since the preceding study, two small metallic fiducial
 markers have been placed and are now located in left-sided perihilar position,
 some 2-3 cm superior and lateral to the expected location of the pulmonary
 mainstem.  This suggests its position to be in the central portion of the
 lateral segment of the left upper lobe. The on previous examination described
 right-sided superior mediastinal mass persists and may have increased slightly
 in size.  No other new pulmonary abnormalities and no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
