                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Recent right upper lobe wedge was done for sub-solid nodule.  Increased

 pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous air is adjacent to the chest tube.  Left upper
 lobe lung nodules described on prior CT are hard to see.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis is minimal.  ET tube ends 6 cm above carina. 
 The heart contour is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient had right upper lobe wedge for sub-solid nodule.  
 Expected findings after recent surgery. There is no pneumothorax.
