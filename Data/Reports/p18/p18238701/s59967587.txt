                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chylothorax.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently
 ___.  Also, chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The heart is normal in size.  A
 bulging of the right mediastinal contour is likely due to a mediastinal fluid
 collection and is grossly unchanged from comparison exams.  Similarly, a small
 right pleural effusion is comparable to the frontal radiograph yesterday, but
 is significantly larger since ___. On lateral radiograph, a fluid
 meniscus in the the right posterior costophrenic sulcus was not seen 6 days
 prior  A small area of atelectasis on the lateral view cannot be further
 localized to either hemithorax.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pleural effusion is comparable to the frontal radiograph
 yesterday, but significantly larger compared to 6 days prior.
 
 2.  Mediastinal fluid collection is seen as a bulging of the right mediastinal
 contour and is grossly unchanged.
 
 3.  Mild atelectasis on the lateral view cannot be further localized to either
 hemithorax.
