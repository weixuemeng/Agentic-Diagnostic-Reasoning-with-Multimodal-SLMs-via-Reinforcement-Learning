                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tube has been
 removed and there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal
 tube has also been removed.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, more
 prominent on the left.  Increased opacification in the region of the surgical
 bed again could reflect atelectasis or hemorrhage.
