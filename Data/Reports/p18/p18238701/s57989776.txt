                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with robotic-assisted VATS right upper
 lobectomy, check interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.
 
 Heart size is unchanged.  Thoracic aorta as before.  There is now a rather
 well-demarcated local mass occupying the right tracheo=bronchial angle and
 bulging in round shape, well demarcated to the right, thus occupying and
 widening the superior right-sided mediastinum.  Patient is status post VATS
 wedge resection in the right upper lobe area.  The latest followup examination
 of ___ demonstrated satisfactory findings with absence of pneumothorax
 and chest tube removal.  A certain degree of prominence of the right upper
 mediastinum existed already at that time.  This finding, however, has changed
 in as much as the apparent mass shows increased prominence.  There are no new
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities present, and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses remain free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing soft tissue prominence in right superior mediastinum
 occupying the right tracheobronchial angle.  The prominence is increasing
 since the next preceding chest examination two weeks ago.  As the patient was
 recently operated for a pulmonary malignancy, right upper lobe finding is
 worrisome for local malignant metastasis.  Depending on clinical situation,
 confirmation of these findings with a repeat chest CT might be considered.
