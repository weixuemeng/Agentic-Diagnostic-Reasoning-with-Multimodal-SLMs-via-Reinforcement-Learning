 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  VATS, right upper lobe wedge resection, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of mediastinal soft tissue structure, likely to be post-operative.  The
 lateral radiograph shows minimal pleural effusions, restricted to the
 posterior aspect of the sinuses.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unremarkable. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
