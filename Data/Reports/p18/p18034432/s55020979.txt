 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 associated interstitial edema.  Prominent bilateral hilar contours are likely
 due to vascular congestion. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed. A large
 hiatal hernia is present. Generalized osteopenia and multilevel compression
 deformities contribute to marked thoracic spine kyphosis.
