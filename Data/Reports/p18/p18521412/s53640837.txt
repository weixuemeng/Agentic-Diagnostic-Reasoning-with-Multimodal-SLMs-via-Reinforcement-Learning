                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent decreased breath sounds on
 right base.  History of recent chemoembolization of liver, evaluate for
 possible pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination ___ ___.  There is status post sternotomy
 and bypass surgery as before.  Observed that a rounded needle fragment is
 again observed just on top of the sternotomy sutures seen on frontal and
 lateral view.  The patient's heart size remains completely unchanged.  No
 pulmonary congestive pattern is identified.  There is now evidence of a small
 amount of pleural effusion blunting the right lateral pleural sinus and
 extending into a small amount of pleural effusion accumulating in the
 dependent posterior pleural sinus.  The amount is small.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considering the history of recent chemoembolization in the liver,
 the pleural effusion may be a reaction to this event.  Amount is small. 
 Suggest a followup examination in a week unless patient shows increased
 symptoms.
