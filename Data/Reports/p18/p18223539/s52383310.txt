                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pneumothorax, followup examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained
 two and a half hours earlier.  Chest findings are grossly unchanged.  The
 left-sided pneumothorax in the apical area persists but has clearly become
 smaller.  Whereas on the first examination, the maximal width is measured
 about 3.5 cm, it has now been reduced to less than 2 cm.  No new abnormalities
 are seen.  Dr. ___ was informed by telephone.  An additional film was
 taken with patient in expiratory phase, demonstrating the pneumothorax being
 of same size as it was on the preceding study.  The conclusion is that the
 left-sided apical pneumothorax is stable in size.
