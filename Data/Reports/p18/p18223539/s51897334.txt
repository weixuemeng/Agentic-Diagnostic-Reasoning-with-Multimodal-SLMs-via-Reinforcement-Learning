                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post procedure with small left
 apical pneumothorax.  Examine for interval change in signs of pneumothorax, is
 status post fiducial seed placement in left upper lobe.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  There exist old
 parenchymal abnormalities and pleural scar formations in the left lower
 hemithorax including sizable linear calcifications in the left-sided
 diaphragm.  All these changes existed already on the next preceding chest
 examination of ___.  Now and apparently after performance of an
 interventional procedure there is a 3 to 4 cm wide apical pneumothorax.  A
 tiny fiducial mark is seen to overlie the anterior lateral portion of the
 fourth rib on the left side.  No other new abnormalities are identified. 
 There is no evidence of significant mediastinal shift in comparison with the
 previous study.  Telephone contact was established with referring physician
 ___. ___.  A tiny pneumothorax was seen earlier during an
 interventional procedure where chest CTs have been performed.  Apparently the
 pneumothorax is getting somewhat larger.
