                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent fall, on coumadin  // Please eval for
 fracture, acute hemorrhage
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re- demonstrated are widespread calcified pleural plaques in the left hemi
 thorax.  Fiducial seed projects over the lateral left upper lung with some
 opacity beneath, better assessed on CT.  There is persistent blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive pleural calcification over the left hemi thorax.  Fiducial seed seen
 projecting over the lateral left upper lung with opacity beneath which appears
 more conspicuous as compared to the prior chest radiograph.  Nonurgent chest
 CT in comparison of this with prior chest CTs would help further assess.
