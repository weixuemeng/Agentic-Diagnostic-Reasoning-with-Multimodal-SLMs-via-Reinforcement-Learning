                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  The lungs are clear of lobar consolidation.  Scattered
 calcific densities projecting over the left hemithorax on the frontal view and
 the anterior mediastinum on the lateral view correspond to calcified pleural
 plaques as demonstrated on prior chest CT.  Additionally, metallic density in
 the left upper lobe is compatible with a fiducial from prior CyberKnife
 therapy.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
