                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Flank pain after fall
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low lung volumes
 with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Old left-sided rib fractures are seen
 without new displaced rib fractures.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac size is normal with tortuous ascending aortic contour. 
 Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine with unchanged mild
 height loss in the mid upper thoracic vertebral bodies.  Hyperdensities
 projecting in the abdomen on the lateral view are likely external to the
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis. Old left sided rib fractures. If there is continued
 concern for a right sided rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is
 recommended.
