 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a

 to the left.  There is minimal left mid-to-lower lung atelectasis/scarring. 
 No definite left-sided consolidation is seen.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The right aspect of the cardiac border is
 not well assessed due to the right-sided opacity.  The left side cardiac
 silhouette is unremarkable.  The mediastinum is grossly unremarkable.
