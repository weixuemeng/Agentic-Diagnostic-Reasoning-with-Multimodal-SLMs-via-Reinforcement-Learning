  Large right pleural effusion is minimally decreased in size.  The remaining

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is smaller today than on ___
 following thoracentesis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Absence of leftward
 mediastinal shift on either study shows an equivalent volume of atelectasis,
 not a feature of an acute effusion.  Depending on the profile of the pleural
 effusion, additional imaging either of the chest or right upper abdominal
 quadrant or both will be indicated.  Small bulge in the contour of the
 descending thoracic aorta could be due to aneurysm or adenopathy, and warrants
 contrast-enhanced chest CTA.
 
 Heart is top normal size.  Left lung is grossly clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax on either side.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 11:15 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
