                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right effusion appears
 somewhat more prominent than on the previous study, extending almost halfway
 up the thoracic spine.  No evidence of mediastinal shift, indicating
 compensatory volume loss in the ipsilateral lung.  The left lung and upper
 right lung are essentially clear.
