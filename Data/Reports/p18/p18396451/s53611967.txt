                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Left base opacity appears increased
 since ___, consistent with a moderate size pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis or infection.  Pulmonary vascular markings are
 prominent, consistent with vascular congestion.  The right lung appears
 otherwise clear. No pneumothorax. Heart size is enlarged but difficult to
 evaluate given the left base opacity.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased left base opacity since the prior exam, consistent with a
 moderate left pleural effusion with underlying infection and/or atelectasis.  
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
