                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is difficult to discern given the presence of left basilar opacity
 which likely reflects a combination of small left pleural effusion with
 atelectasis or infection.  The heart size is slightly increased, now appearing
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  No right-sided pleural effusion is seen, and
 there is no pneumothorax.  An osseous excrescence off of the left humeral head
 may be posttraumatic in etiology.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 otherwise demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacity likely reflects a combination of small left pleural
 effusion and left basilar atelectasis or infection.  Heart size is difficult
 to discern but appears increased in size compared to the prior, now moderately
 enlarged.
