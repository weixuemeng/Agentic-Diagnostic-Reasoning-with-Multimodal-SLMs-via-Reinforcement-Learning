                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia infiltration.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 at an outside facility.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval improvement in bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and
 overall improved aeration consistent with resolving pulmonary edema. 
 Opacifications noted in the left lung base, likely represent atelectasis,
 though resolving pneumonia is a possibility.    No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary arteries are somewhat prominent, suggesting a
 degree of pulmonary hypertension.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the
 aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolving pulmonary edema.  Left lower lung opacifications,
 likely atelectasis though resolving pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting is possib.
