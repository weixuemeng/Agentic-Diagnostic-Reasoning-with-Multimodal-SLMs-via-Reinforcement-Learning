   Comparison
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated, NG tube placement  // confirm NG
 placement      confirm NG placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 15:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Interval extubation.  Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter and left
 internal jugular central line are unchanged in position.  Bilateral layering
 effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities favoring compressive atelectasis
 although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall improved aeration in
 the upper lungs.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged.
