                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DLBCL s/p multiple complications, now with
 worsening cough  // Any evidence of pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Given changes in patient positioning, moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
 probably unchanged.  The retrocardiac area is not well seen, possibly due to
 technical factors. Heart size is top-normal.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  A left IJ central
 venous catheter terminates in the brachiocephalic vein near its confluence
 with the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probably unchanged moderate pleural effusions given changes in patient
 positioning. Retrocardiac area not well evaluated, possibly due to technical
 factors.  In the appropriate clinical setting, atelectasis or consolidation
 could be considered.  A left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the
 brachiocephalic vein near its confluence with the SVC.
