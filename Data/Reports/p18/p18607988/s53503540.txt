                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with positional midsternal pain, ? rib fracture 
 // ? rib fracture
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 16:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right and left IJ central line tips overlie the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, by no overt CHF.  Retrocardiac opacity, compatible left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, is again seen, minimally worse.
 
 There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, which could reflect small joint
 effusions, also similar to prior.
 
 No lucent or sclerotic fracture line or displaced fracture fragment is
 detected.  Please note that a fracture to the anterior cartilaginous portion
 of.  This would not be apparent radiographically.  In addition, there is no
 lateral view for dedicated sternal view for assessment of the sternum or
 manubrium.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly,  left lateral left lower lobe collapse and consolidation, and
 small effusions, together with upper zone redistribution, are similar to prior
 study.
 
 No obvious rib fracture and no pneumothorax.  Assessment of the anterior
 cartilaginous portions of the ribs and of the sternum itself is limited on
 this examination.
