 the right subclavian central line.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm with tip not identified.  The heart remains stably enlarged.

 pulmonary edema, pneumonia or ARDS.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No
 obvious pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax
 is diminished given supine technique.
