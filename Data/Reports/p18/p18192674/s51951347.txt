                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall.  Question fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates normal heart size. 
 The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded with arch calcifications.  Mild
 prominence of the upper mediastinum is felt to be related to supine
 positioning and AP projection, less likely vascular injury.  The azygos
 contour is full.  The lungs are clear without evidence of edema, pneumothorax,
 or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Azygos fullness could be related to hydration versus a component of right
 heart insufficiency.
 3.  This exam is not designed for assessment of rib fractures; however, no
 displaced osseous injury is detected.
