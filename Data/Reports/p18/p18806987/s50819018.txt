 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest are compared to previous exam from
 ___.  ET tube is seen with tip at the carina, approaching the right

 the upper SVC.  Mediastinal chest tubes identified in place.  Low lung volumes
 seen on the current exam.  The lungs are clear of large confluent
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for
 technique and low lung volumes.  Median sternotomy wires are now seen. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable, noting surgical
 clips in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip at the carina, potentially proximal right
 main stem bronchus and should be retracted.  Nasogastric tube tip just past
 the GE junction and can be advanced.
