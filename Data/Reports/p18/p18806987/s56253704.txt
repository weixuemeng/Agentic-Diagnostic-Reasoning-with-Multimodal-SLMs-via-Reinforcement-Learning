                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal, evaluate effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular venous access catheter,
 have been removed.  In addition, there has been removal of the previously
 present chest tubes and nasogastric tube.  A left-sided PICC terminates with
 tip in the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  There is increased bibasilar
 atelectasis and consolidation with particular left retrocardiac opacity. 
 Diffuse increased opacity throughout the remainder of the lung field is likely
 related to low lung volumes.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of endotracheal tube, chest tubes and venous
 access catheter.  No definite evidence of pneumothorax, but increased
 bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation.
