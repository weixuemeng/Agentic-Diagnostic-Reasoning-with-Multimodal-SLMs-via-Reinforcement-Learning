                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shunt placement, assessment for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  A minimal air bubble under the right
 hemidiaphragm could be resulting from this procedure.  Both on the frontal and
 the lateral radiograph, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  In particular,
 there is no evidence of pneumonia or other infectious process.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal contours.
