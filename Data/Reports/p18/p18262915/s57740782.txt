                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with tachypnea, fever, tachycardia, COPD HX  // evaluate for
 pneumonia, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffusely increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs. Lung
 bases demonstrate increased opacity which is thought to be due to overlying
 soft tissues. Underlying effusion would be difficult to exclude. Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Anterior and posterior
 fixation hardware in the cervical thoracic spine is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs likely in part due to
 overlying soft tissues although a superimposed component of edema or atypical
 infection or possible. Consider PA and lateral in the Radiology department if
 patient is amenable.
