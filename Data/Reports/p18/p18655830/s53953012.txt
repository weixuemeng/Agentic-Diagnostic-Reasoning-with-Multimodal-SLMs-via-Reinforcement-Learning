                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of gastroparesis and recent cardiac surgery
 presenting with nausea vomiting. Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to baseline there is a new right middle lobe opacity partially
 obscuring the inferior right cardiac margin. There is also an opacity in the
 right costophrenic angle with an associated small pleural effusion better seen
 in the lateral view. Linear atelectasis is seen in the right mid lung. Stable
 moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle and right lower lobe opacities with associated pleural effusion
 may represent a combination of atelectasis and infection/aspiration in this
 patient with recent vomiting episodes.
