                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain and shortness of breath, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are present, left greater than right.  The cardiac
 silhouette has increased since prior study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
 have accumulated in the interim. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 Osseous structures are grossly intact. Median sternotomy wires and surgical
 clips are noted projecting over the mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which could reflect
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with mild cardiomegaly.
