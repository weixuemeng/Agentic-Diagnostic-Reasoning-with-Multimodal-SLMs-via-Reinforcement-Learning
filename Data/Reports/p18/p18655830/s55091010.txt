 There are bilateral layering pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
 adjacent atelectasis; this is better demonstrated on the recent CT performed
 yesterday evening. No new areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There
 is no pneumothorax or over pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged.
