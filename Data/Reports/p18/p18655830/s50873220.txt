                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, now with worsening nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 On the lateral view is a 9 to 14mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the
 retrosternal lung just superior to the pulmonary outflow tract.  There is no
 corresponding finding on the frontal view. I cannot be sure if the opacity was
 present a year ago on ___, however it was not present on a Chest
 CTA a month earlier, ___.  Since the finding is incidental to
 the the patient's current complaint, it would be reasonable to repeat a
 lateral chest film AND SHALLOW LATERAL OBLIQUE VIEWS in 3 or 4 weeks. Dr ___
 ___, was paged to discuss these findings.
 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Anterior
 wedge compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
