                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after myomectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Lung volumes are low. 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is still normal, but azygous and mediastinal veins
 are mildly dilated, perhaps an indication of right heart dysfunction or other
 cause of elevated central venous pressure.  Clinical correlation would be
 wise.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Possible right heart dysfunction or other cause of elevated central venous
 pressure.
