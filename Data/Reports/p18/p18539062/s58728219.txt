                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A hemodialysis catheter has been placed via a left-sided approach,
 with tip terminating in the lower superior vena cava near the junction with
 the right atrium.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  Pre-existing permanent
 pacemaker remains in place, unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion has increased in size in the interval, but small left pleural
 effusion is similar.  Persistent retrocardiac opacities, more confluent on the
 right than the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild CHF with enlarging moderate right pleural effusion.  Unchanged small
 left pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Persistent bilateral retrocardiac opacities, which may reflect
 atelectasis.  Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded, particularly in the
 right lung base.
