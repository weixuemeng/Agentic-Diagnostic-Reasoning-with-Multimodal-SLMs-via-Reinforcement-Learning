                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker generator overlies the right chest
 with leads intact and in standard position projecting over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Bibasilar consolidations
 persist, however, slightly increased on the left compared to the right,
 findings likely secondary to increased atelectasis.  The right pleural
 effusion has increased and a new small left pleural effusion is present. 
 Findings likely reflect mild decompensated heart failure as no definite septal
 lines are evident.  The upper lungs are clear.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly has increased and is now
 moderate.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on
 the left, and bibasilar atelectasis likely reflect decompensated heart
 failure.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly has increased, now moderate. 
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings to Dr. ___ at 7:55 am on
 ___ by telephone.
