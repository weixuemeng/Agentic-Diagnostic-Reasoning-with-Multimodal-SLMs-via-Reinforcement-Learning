 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:44 PM
  Slightly decreased but persistent right pleural effusion and tiny left pleural
  effusion. Improved aeration in visualized right lower lung, but low lung
  volumes limit evaluation inferiorly. Residual patchy opacities in medial left
  lower lung are likely atelectasis. But infection at the lung bases cannot be
  excluded. Cardiomegaly persists. Mild pulmonary vascular prominence is
  slightly improved. No pneumothorax.

 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CHF, ESRD with fever.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion
 slightly decreased from prior exam.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 HD catheter is in standard position.  Right transvenous pacemaker leads are in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no evident pneumothorax. 
 Aeration of the right lower lobe has improved.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac
 opacities are stable; likely atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Vascular congestion has improved, almost resolved.
