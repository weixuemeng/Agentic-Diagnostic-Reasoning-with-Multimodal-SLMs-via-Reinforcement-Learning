                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest demonstrates small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The right pleural effusion has decreased
 slightly in size and the left remains unchanged.  Heart size is enlarged. 
 Increased perihilar prominence and cephalization of vasculature is compatible
 with volume overload.  A left dialysis catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  A
 right-sided pacemaker is seen with wires terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle, as expected.  There is no suspicious osseous lesions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Volume overload marked by cardiomegaly, bilateral small pleural
 effusions and increased vascular prominence.
