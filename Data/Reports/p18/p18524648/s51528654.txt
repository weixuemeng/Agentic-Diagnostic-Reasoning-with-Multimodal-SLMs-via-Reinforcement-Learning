                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright radiograph of chest was reviewed in comparison
 with prior radiograph from ___ to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has minimally worsened whereas right lower
 lung consolidation is unchanged since ___. Apparent increase in
 the left lower lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia, is probably a function
 of position. Pleural effusion if any is minimal bilaterally and stable. 
 
 Since patient is rotated, assessment of cardiomediastianl sillhouette is
 limited, but within the limitation, moderate to large heart size and
 mediastinal contour appears no different to prior radiographs.
