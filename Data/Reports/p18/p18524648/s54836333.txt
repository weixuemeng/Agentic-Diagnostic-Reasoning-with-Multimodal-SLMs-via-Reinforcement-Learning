                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent mitral valve replacement, now with
 hypoxia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mitral valve and mediastinal clips are unchanged compared to prior
 exam.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are not widened.  The lungs show no lobar consolidation, but diffuse
 perihilar airspace opacities compatible with pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle as well as thickening of the right upper lateral
 aspect of the pleural space suggests areas of pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
