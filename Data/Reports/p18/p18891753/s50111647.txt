                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Volume loss in the left hemithorax with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Surgical clips are also seen.  These findings suggest left
 sided likley lower lobectomy.  There is opacity at the left costophrenic angle
 laterally and posteriorly potentially due to scarring or small effusion. 
 There is a nodular opacity projecting over the right lung apex which could be
 confluence of shadows of the anterior second rib and scapula.  Focal opacity
 at the right lung base as well abutting the diaphragm.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable prior left lower lobectomy. Focal opacity at the right
 lung apex potentially confluence of shadows but repeat with including apical
 lordotic view is suggested to further characterize.  Or comparison with
 priors, presumably performed elsewhere suggested for this and the right
 basilar opacity.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at time of interpretation.
