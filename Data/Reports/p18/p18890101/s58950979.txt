                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy
 opacities in the lower lungs are probably due to atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs appear clear.  A few air-fluid levels in the epigastric region are
 non-specific; no dilated bowel is evident or free air.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild gastric
 distention and few nonspecific epigastric air-fluid levels.
