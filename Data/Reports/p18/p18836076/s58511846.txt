 the right lung have essentially resolved.  Residual bibasilar opacities could
 be due to atelectasis, or pneumonia, in the correct clinical setting.  There
 is mild cardiomegaly and persistent left apical pleural thickening.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.

 Bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection
 is not excluded in this clinical setting.
