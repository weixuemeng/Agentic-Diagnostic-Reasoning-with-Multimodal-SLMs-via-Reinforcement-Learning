 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar

 right lung base and right mid lung field, likely involving the upper lobe, are
 concerning for infection. No pulmonary edema is clearly noted. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of
 these findings.
