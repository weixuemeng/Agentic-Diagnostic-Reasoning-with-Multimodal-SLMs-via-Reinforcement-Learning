                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hematemesis.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed at an outside institution three hours
 prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a hazy opacity in the right
 upper lobe adjacent to the mediastinum which is likely due to rotasted
 position. No other focal opacities are noted bilaterally.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  An esophageal tube is seen ending within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lung opacity is felt to be due to rotated position. A
 repeat radiograph with the patient carefully positioned is recommended.
 Otherwise unremarkable chest radiographic examination.
