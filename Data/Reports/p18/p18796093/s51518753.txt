                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the recent study, a right pleural effusion has decreased in
 size with only a small residual effusion remaining.  There is associated
 improved atelectasis at the right lung base.  
 
 A right chest wall mass with associated rib destruction at the levels of the
 right eighth, ninth and tenth rib levels is again demonstrated, but difficult
 to precisely measure radiographically.  There has been apparent increase in
 extent of bone destruction in the ribs and adjacent paraspinal regions.  Lungs
 are otherwise remarkable for multiple small pulmonary nodules bilaterally. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Decreased size of right pleural effusion, but apparent increase in extent
 of bone destruction associated with known right chest wall mass.  Consider
 chest CT for more complete evaluation of the mass, particularly to evaluate
 for spinal involvement as there was evidence of early cortical destruction of
 a vertebral body reported on prior CT in ___.
 
 2.  Multiple pulmonary metastases.
