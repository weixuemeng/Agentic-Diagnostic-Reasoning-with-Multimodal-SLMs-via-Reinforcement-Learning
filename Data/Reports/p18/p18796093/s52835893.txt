                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large right pleural effusion is similar to recent CT scan allowing
 for positional differences, and likely has a subpulmonic component.  Adjacent
 atelectasis persists in the right middle and right lower lobes.  Within the
 left lung, several nodules are visualized, and have been more fully evaluated
 by CT.  Known right lung nodules are partially obscured by the pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.Known destructive right rib lesions are seen to
 better detail on  prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent large right pleural effusion with likely subpulmonic component.
 
 2.  Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic renal cell
 carcinoma.  Known destructive right rib lesions are seen to better detail on
 prior CT.
