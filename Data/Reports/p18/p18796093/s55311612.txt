                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent
 large right paraspinal mass, more fully delineated by CT.  Widespread
 pulmonary nodules are again demonstrated consistent with metastatic disease. 
 A more confluent opacity is present in the right lower lobe posteriorly, and
 is at least in part due to atelectasis with associated displacement of the
 major fissure.  Moderate right pleural effusion with intrafissural component
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening right lower lobe opacity, which is at least in part due to
 atelectasis given associated fissural displacement. However, coexisting
 pneumonia is possible given clinical suspicion for this entity.
 
 2.  Widespread pulmonary metastases and large right paraspinal mass , better
 delineated on recent CT of several days earlier.
 
 3.  Moderate right pleural effusion.
