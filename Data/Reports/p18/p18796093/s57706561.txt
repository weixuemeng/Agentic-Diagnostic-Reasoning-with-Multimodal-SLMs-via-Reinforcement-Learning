  Limited study demonstrates perhaps a small decrease in right pleural effusion.

  not well-delineated on this study.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Renal cell cancer, worsening hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial
 change.  The pre-existing minimal right pleural effusion might have slightly
 decreased in extent.  Nodular structures are projecting over the left
 costophrenic sinus in almost unchanged manner.  The pulmonary nodules
 documented on the chest CT examination from ___, as well as the
 known right posterior chest wall lesion are not well visualized on the current
 image.
