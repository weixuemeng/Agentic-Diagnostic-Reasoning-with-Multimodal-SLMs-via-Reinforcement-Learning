                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been thoracentesis
 with placement of a Pleurx catheter and reduction in the degree of fluid in
 the left pleural space.  Although not well seen, there is the suggestion of a
 small apical pneumothorax on the left.  Residual retrocardiac opacification is
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Streaks of atelectasis
 are seen in the right lung.
 
 Port-A-Cath remains in place.
