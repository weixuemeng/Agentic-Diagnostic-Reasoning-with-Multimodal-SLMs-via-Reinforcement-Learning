                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the region of the distal SVC.  There
 are low lung volumes.  There is a linear left base opacity again seen, which
 most likely relates to atelectasis.  There is new right base patchy opacity
 raising concern for infection although could also be due to aspiration.  The
 left costophrenic angle is slightly blunted although to lesser extent than on
 the prior study.  No large pleural effusion seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No large pleural effusion, minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, although to a lesser extent than on the prior study suggests interval
 decrease in left pleural effusion.
 2.  Right lung base consolidation, new since prior, may be due to infection or
 aspiration.  Left base atelectasis.
