 HISTORY:  Status post left thoracentesis, pigtail drain capped.  Question
 pneumothorax.Also, complaint of chest pain.
 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy opacity at the left lung
 base.  A left-sided pigtail catheter is again seen.  Minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is also again seen.  A small left apical pneumothorax
 is present.  It is better seen on the current exam and not clearly visible on
 the prior exam, but may have been obscured by overlying bony structures.  The
 right and left lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  No right-sided effusion. 
 Indwelling catheter again noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax, recurrent versus better seen, compared with
 the film obtained earlier the same day (13:37 p.m).  
 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change. Patchy opacity at the left base and
 small left effusion are stable.
