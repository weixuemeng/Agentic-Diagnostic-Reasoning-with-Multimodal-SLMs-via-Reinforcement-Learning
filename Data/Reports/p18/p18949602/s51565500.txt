 INDICATION:  Recent chemotherapy, cough, fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Left versus right discrepancy in density of the thoracic soft tissues,
 potentially suggestive of previous left breast surgery.
