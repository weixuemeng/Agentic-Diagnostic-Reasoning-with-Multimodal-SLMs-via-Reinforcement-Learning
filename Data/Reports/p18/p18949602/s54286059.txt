 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Recent thoracentesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is of top normal size, exaggerated by a by low lung
 volumes.  Left pleural effusion has increased since the prior exam, now
 moderate.  Right pleural effusion is small.  Right infrahilar opacity has
 slightly improved since the prior exam.  Retrocardiac opacity is compatible
 with atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  Catheter of an accessed right
 chest wall port terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Moderate left pleural effusion, increased since prior.   Small right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.

 3.  Retrocardiac opacity is compatible with atelectasis but may represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
