                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female complains of weakness and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right chest wall port is
 seen with catheter tip in the mid to lower SVC.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities most suggestive of scarring given persistence.  Blunting of the
 posterior costophrenic angles suggest small effusions.  The lungs are clear of
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Prominence of the hilar contour on the right
 as well as the AP window is compatible with prominent lymph nodes identified
 on previous CT scan.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from most
 recent exam.  Left mastectomy changes are again noted.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable small effusions without other acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
