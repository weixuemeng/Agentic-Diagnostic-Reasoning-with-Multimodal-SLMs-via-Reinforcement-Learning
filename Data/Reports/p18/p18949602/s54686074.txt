                                 FINAL REPORT
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Postoperative day 4 status post debulking for ovarian
 cancer with worsening oxygen saturations.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable chest radiograph obtained with comparison to the examination
 performed approximately 10 hours previously demonstrates persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity at the base, probably with associated effusion, although
 difficult to assess on this single view.  The left upper lung zones as well as
 the right lung zones appear relatively clear.  Rounded opacities seen at the
 right hilum are better demonstrated on the subsequent CT, which was performed
 after the study.
 
 Right-sided IJ central venous catheter is present, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis and probable effusion.
 Right hilar opacity consistent with lymph node.
