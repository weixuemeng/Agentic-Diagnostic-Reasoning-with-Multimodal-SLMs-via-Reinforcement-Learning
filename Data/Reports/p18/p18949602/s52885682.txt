 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right chest wall port is seen with

 suggestive of atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear noting resolution of
 previously seen right basilar consolidation.  There is no effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.

 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Streaky left basilar opacity most
 suggestive of atelectasis.
