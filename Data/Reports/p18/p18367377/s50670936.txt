                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with first rib fracture and fevers.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the torso from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is present, 6.3 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach, though the side port is
 at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 Since the prior exam, there is slightly increased linear opacification at the
 left base.  Other scattered basilar opacities are unchanged.  These most
 likely represent atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The known
 left first rib fracture is better appreciated on the CT of the torso.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight increase in left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise, no significant
 change.
 2.  Enteric tube with the tip in the stomach, though the side port is at the
 gastroesophageal junction.
