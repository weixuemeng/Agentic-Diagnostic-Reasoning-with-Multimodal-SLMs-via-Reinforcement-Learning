                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall, nasogastric tube and ET tube placed,
 check position.
 
 CHEST:

 the nasogastric tube cannot be determined due to underpenetration and
 overlying soft tissues, but may lie in the distal esophagus.
 
 The lung fields are clear.
