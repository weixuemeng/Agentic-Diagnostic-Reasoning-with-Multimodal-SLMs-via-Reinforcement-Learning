                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, sputum.
 
 Carotid stent.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 There is probable hyperinflation, suggesting COPD.  There is cardiomegaly,
 with an unfolded aorta and a left ventricular configuration.  The right heart
 border is also prominent.  There is upper zone redistribution, with possible
 minimal vascular blurring.  There is left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, worse compared with ___ at 9:52 a.m., and new minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Some patchy opacity in right
 cardiophrenic region and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle are
 grossly unchanged.  Small roundeded densities overlying the left upper chest
 correspond to a small sclerotic foci seen in the anterior rib on a ___
 chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation could
 reflect the presence of a pneumonic infiltrate.  Changes in the right
 cardiophrenic region could also reflect a pneumonic infiltrate.
