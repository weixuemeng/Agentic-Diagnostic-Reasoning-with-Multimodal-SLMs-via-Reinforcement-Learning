                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hemoptysis with history of recent pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 08:40 a.m. and ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Left retrocardiac opacity is persistent, potentially
 may be slightly increased.  This opacity in part may reflect the neo-esophagus
 and overall appears to be unchanged since ___.  There is
 questionable potential slight additional opacity that might reflect interval
 development of aspiration or pneumonia, but in the absence of patient's
 symptoms most likely reflects changes in the distention of the neo-esophagus.
 
 Left upper lung nodular relatively dense opacity, unchanged since multiple
 prior studies, represents rib abnormality, benign, most likely fibrodysplasia.
