                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the Chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is a new
 area of opacification adjacent to the right heart border which partially
 obscures the diaphragmatic surface.  There is also a retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with gastric pull-up and is unchanged since the prior exams. 
 Previously seen left rib calcifications are also unchanged since the prior
 study.  Some linear atelectasis at the left lung base is noted.  There is no
 evidence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Right lower lung opacification which is most likely atelectasis
 may also represent aspiration given the presence of gastric pull-up.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could also represent an infectious process.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at 14:00, five minutes after the finding was discovered.
