                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper
 limits of normal in size and there is no evidence of vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is again seen and there is atelectatic change at the base.
 
 There is an air-fluid level projected over the mediastinum consistent with the
 recent surgery.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
