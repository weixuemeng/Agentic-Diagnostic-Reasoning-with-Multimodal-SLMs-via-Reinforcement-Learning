                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hemoptysis and recent diagnosis of left
 lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.  Evaluate for evidence of
 alveolar hemorrhage, infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, latest ones from ___
 and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is
 noted.  Retrocardiac opacity is likely related to gastric pull through, but
 previously seen superimposed pulmonary consolidation cannot be optimally
 evaluated for without a lateral view.   Mild cardiomegaly and aortic
 tortuosity are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable otherwise. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again
 seen are three bone islands projecting over the anterior left second rib.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Previously seen
 retrocardiac opacity not optimal evaluated without a lateral view.
