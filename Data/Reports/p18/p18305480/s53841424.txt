                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pneumonia in the
 right lower lobe.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is substantial interval improvement in the right lower lobe and
 potentially right middle lobe with previously present consolidation.  There is
 still some opacity demonstrated, which most likely reflect residual of prior
 infectious process.  Followup in four weeks for documentation of complete
 resolution is required.  The rest of the lungs are clear.  The heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly, moderate.
