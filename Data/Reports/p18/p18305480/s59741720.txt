                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever with course right lower
 lobe breath sounds.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs in comparison to ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since the prior examination, there has been interval development of
 opacification within the right lower lobe, some of which demonstrate a nodular
 configuration.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There are no
 other focal areas of opacification.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable with changes relating to known esophagectomy and neoesophagus
 formation, and tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacification with nodular component, most
 compatible with pneumonia.  However, given relative nodularity, followup to
 resolution is recommended with repeat radiographs after treatment.
