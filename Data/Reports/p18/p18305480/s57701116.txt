                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male here for followup study after diagnosis of right
 lower lung pneumonia in ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___ and PA and
 lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously seen right lower lobe pneumonia has resolved with
 insignificant residual opacity.  There are no new areas of focal
 consolidation.  The lungs are well expanded and clear with no mass lesion,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates
 mildly tortuous aorta, but is otherwise normal.  Three collinear rounded
 opacities are seen projecting over the lateral left upper lung zone at the
 level of the aortic arch, found to be bone islands of the second and third
 left anterior ribs.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic
 spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Radiographic resolution of previously diagnosed pneumonia.  No
 further followup is required.
