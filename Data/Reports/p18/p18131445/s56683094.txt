                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:07
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the severity in extent of the
 pre-existing diffuse parenchymal opacities has slightly increased. Also
 increased is the diameter of the pulmonary vasculature. These progression
 suggests a combination of mild to moderate pulmonary edema, together with a
 diffuse parenchymal process, likely infectious or inflammatory in nature. 
 Potential differential causes could be pneumocystis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or
 hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
