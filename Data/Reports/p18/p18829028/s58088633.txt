                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with HFpEF presenting with shortness of breath,
 +fatigue+cough  // Evidence of heart failure? Other acute cardiopulmonary
 pathology?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Thoracic aorta is diffusely calcified.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 mildly engorged, unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly may suggest the presence of trace pleural
 effusions.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with patchy left basilar atelectasis and
 probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
