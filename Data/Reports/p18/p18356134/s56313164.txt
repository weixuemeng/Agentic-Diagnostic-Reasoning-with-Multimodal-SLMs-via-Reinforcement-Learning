                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, cough, and pedal edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification is again noted in the aorta.  Mild prominence of the hila
 bilaterally is unchanged, suggestive of pulmonary artery enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of congestive failure.  Prominence of the hila
 as on prior which may reflect pulmonary artery enlargement.  A CT scan on
 non-emergent basis can be performed if further delineation is desired.
