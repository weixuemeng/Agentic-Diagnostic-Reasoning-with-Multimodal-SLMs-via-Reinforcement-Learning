                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Moderate
 to severe cardiomegaly is present.  The aorta is unfolded.  The hilar contours
 are normal, and there is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacity in the right
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  Right basilar atelectasis.
