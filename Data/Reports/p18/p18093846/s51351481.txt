                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of reproducible chest pain over the left fourth/fifth
 ribs.  Please evaluate for rib lesion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  There appears to be effacement of the
 right mediastinal border, which could be from a tortuous aorta or anterior
 mediastinal mass.  Posteriorly in the retrocardiac region, note is made of a
 small 7-mm nodule.  There is no pneumothorax. No pleural effusions are
 identified.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Effacement of the right mediastinal border, either secondary to a tortuous
 aorta or anterior mediastinal mass.
 
 2. 7-mm nodule seen in the retrocardiac region on the lateral radiograph.
 
 Recommend CT with contrast for further evaluation.
 
 Findings were placed in the critical results dashboard by Dr. ___ at 6p
 on the day of the exam.
