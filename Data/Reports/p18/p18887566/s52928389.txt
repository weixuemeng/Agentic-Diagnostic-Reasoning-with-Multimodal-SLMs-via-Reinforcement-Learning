                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left clavicle pain status post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's arm overlies the chest on the lateral view, partially obscuring
 the view.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen although please note that the
 distal aspectS of the clavicles are not include on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patient's arm overlies the chest on the lateral view, making the lateral views
 slightly suboptimal.  Otherwise, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
