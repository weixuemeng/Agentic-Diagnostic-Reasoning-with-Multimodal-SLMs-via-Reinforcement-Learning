 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SDH and IPH with known pleural mass w/ new
 SOB  // r/o acute process, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased the patient rotation compared to the prior film. Allowing
 for this, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is hazy opacity in
 the mid and lower left long increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung remains grossly clear subtle opacity
 in the right cardiophrenic region seen on the prior film is not visible on
 today's examination.  No right-sided effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.  No CHF or pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant change compared with 1 day earlier.  Please see report of
 chest CT obtained on ___ at 10:15
