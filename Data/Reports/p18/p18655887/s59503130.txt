 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chf w/ pulm edema earlier at osh  // pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. The patient has an atypical
 position in this radiograph, which limits interpretation of this study.
 Atelectasis is seen at the bilateral bases, left worse than right. The cardiac
 silhouette appears mildly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax,
 definite pleural effusion, or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
