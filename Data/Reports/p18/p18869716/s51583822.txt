                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen
 within the left lung base as well as within the peripheral aspect of the right
 mid lung field, likely involving the right upper lobe and right middle lobe. 
 These findings appear improved compared to the prior radiographs obtained in
 ___.  Atelectatic changes are also seen within the right lung base. 
 No additional areas of focal consolidation are present.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacities within the peripheral aspect of the right mid lung field,
 likely the right upper and middle lobes, as well as the left lung base, in a
 distribution similar to that seen on the prior radiographs from ___,
 but somewhat improved.  While these findings could reflect recurrent
 pneumonia, other processes including inflammatory processes  should be
 considered.  Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended, and if the
 findings persist, a chest CT is suggested.
