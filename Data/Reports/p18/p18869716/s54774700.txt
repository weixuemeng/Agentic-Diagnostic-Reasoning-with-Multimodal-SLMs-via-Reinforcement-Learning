                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some residual band of
 atelectasis overlying the cardiac silhouette on the lateral views.  The areas
 of suggested patchy consolidation have essentially cleared.  Poor definition
 of the outer aspect of the left heart border, most likely represents a fat
 pad.
