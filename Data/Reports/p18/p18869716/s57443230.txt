                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia.  Returning with cough and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there are patchy infiltrates at the bilateral bases and the
 right middle and upper lung zones.  These appear to be in a similar
 distribution to the prior radiograph from ___.  No definite new
 opacities are identified and the opacities seen have not worsened.  There is
 no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent patchy bilateral infiltrates, which could be
 multifocal pneumonia.  Given that it has not improved with treatment(although
 one week), other considerations would be an inflammatory process or an
 atypical infection.  Suggest continued follow-up to assess for resolution.  If
 warranted, this could be further characterized by CT.
