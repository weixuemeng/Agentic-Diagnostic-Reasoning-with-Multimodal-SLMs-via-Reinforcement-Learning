                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD  // dyspnea      DYSPNEA 4 DAYS,IMPROVED
 SINCE HX CAD R/O ABNORMALITY
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Most recent prior chest radiograph, ___, when the patient was in
 mild heart failure, showed interval increase in mediastinal caliber in the
 regions of both the ascending aorta and azygos vein.  There was also pulmonary
 vascular congestion at that time.  Today although the mediastinal contour and
 right paratracheal region are still abnormal, they have improved and there is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion, suggesting that the findings are really due
 to mediastinal venous engorgement.  Alternatively, if there is clinical
 concern for adenopathy, chest CT scanning would be indicated.  The heart is
 normal size.  The lungs are clear and there is no pleural abnormality.
