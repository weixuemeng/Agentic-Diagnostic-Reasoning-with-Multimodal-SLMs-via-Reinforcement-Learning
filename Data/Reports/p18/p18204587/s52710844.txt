                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  Right lower lobe
 opacities are likely atelectasis, otherwise, the lungs are clear.
