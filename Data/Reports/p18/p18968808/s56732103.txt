                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing falls and inability to ambulate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There
 is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild
 dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is demonstrated with moderate to
 severe multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
