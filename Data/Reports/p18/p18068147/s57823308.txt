                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are hyperinflated.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Streaky and linear bibasilar opacities
 in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases without focal consolidation.
