                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath after recent trauma. 
 Known rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ as well as earlier torso CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Although a left anterior third rib fracture can be visualized, for
 the most part, known left-sided fractures are not well assessed.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Streaky opacities in the lower lungs
 suggest atelectasis in association with low lung volumes.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A mild-to-moderate superior
 endplate compression fracture along an upper thoracic vertebral body appears
 unchanged.  An L1 vertebral body compression fracture is not well assessed,
 but also appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with increasing bibasilar atelectasis, but no
 evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Rib fractures are not well
 assessed.
