                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall and left-sided rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. 
 There is a left paraspinal opacity projecting just above the medial left
 hemidiaphragm which is nonspecific but may relate to patient's hiatal hernia
 as seen on CT from ___ or alternatively atelectasis.  Flattening of the
 diaphragms persists suggesting possible COPD.  There may be mild central
 pulmonary vascular prominence without overt pulmonary edema.  Slight blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is likely due to overlying soft tissue, no
 large pleural effusion is seen.  No definite focal consolidation.  The lateral
 left ribs are not well assessed on the current study due to overlying soft
 tissue and underpenetration, no obvious displaced fracture is seen.  However,
 rib series or CT are more sensitive.  Degenerative changes are seen at the
 acromioclavicular joints.  DISH is again seen along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with possible mild pulmonary vascular prominence without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Lateral ribs not well assessed due to underpenetration
 due to overlying soft tissue, no obvious displaced fracture seen, however,
 dedicated rib series or CT are more sensitive
