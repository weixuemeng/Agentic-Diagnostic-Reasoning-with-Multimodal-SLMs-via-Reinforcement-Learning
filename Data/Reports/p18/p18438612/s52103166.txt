 study.  There is continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, likely
 secondary to volume loss in the left lower lung.  Multiple left rib fractures
 are again visualized.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent bibasilar opacities, consistent with consolidations seen on CT
 on ___.
 
 2.  Continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm secondary to left lower lung
 volume loss.
