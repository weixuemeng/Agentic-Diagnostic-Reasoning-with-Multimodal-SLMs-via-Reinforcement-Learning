                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Aspiration pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right lower
 lobe and left perihilar opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia are
 grossly unchanged.  Left lower lobe opacities a combination of small effusion
 and adjacent consolidation are stable.  This consolidation could be large area
 of atelectasis and/or pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild vascular
 congestion has improved.
