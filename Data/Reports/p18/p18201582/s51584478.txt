                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AMS, s/p TAVR, requiring 3L O2, breathing
 seems more labored  // Eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from several hr earlier, there has been
 worsening hemorrhage opacification in the left lung base.  It is uncertain
 whether this might represent localized aspiration or rapidly developing
 pneumonia, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
 No other relevant change.
