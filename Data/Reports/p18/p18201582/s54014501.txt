                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with O2 desat, tachypnea  w/underlying c/f HCAP
 vs pneumonitis  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, the left lung base is less well
 aerated. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular
 congestion with a small right pleural effusion and a new, small left pleural
 effusion +/- adjacent atelectasis.  Heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left basilar opacities may reflect increased left lower lobe
 atelectasis and pulmonary edema or alternatively a developing left lower lobe
 pneumonia.
