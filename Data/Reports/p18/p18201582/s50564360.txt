 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:20 AM
  New elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with increased atelectasis in the
  right lung. An opacity along the right heart border is also likely
  atelectasis. There is vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. The
  cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged other than a new prosthetic aortic
  valve. A right central venous catheter is in the distal right jugular vein.
  The stomach is distended and air-filled. On one of the images, there is the
  appearance of possible free intraperitoneal air below the left hemidiaphragm,
  though it most likely is the distended stomach superimposed upon the
  diaphragm. If possible, an abdominal radiograph is recommended for
  confirmation.
  
  Results discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:18 PM on ___ by Dr. ___ at the time
  the findings were discovered.
