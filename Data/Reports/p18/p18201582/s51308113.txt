                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic stenosis and dyspnea  // pls eval for
 pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is increased pulmonary
 edema, most prominently within the right upper lung, and there has been
 interval removal of the right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and moderate bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the
 right and slightly increased on the left.  Median sternotomy wires are midline
 and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive pulmonary edema.  Asymmetrical right upper lobe opacity probably
 reflects a asymmetrical edema and less likely a secondary process such as
 aspiration.
