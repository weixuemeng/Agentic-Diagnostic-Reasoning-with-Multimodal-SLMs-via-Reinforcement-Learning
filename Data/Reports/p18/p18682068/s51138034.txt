                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malpositioned PICC line.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line can be followed up to the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins with the superior vena cava, somewhat more proximal than
 before.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There is mild leftward convex curvature centered along
 the lower thoracic spine as before.  Bony structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line terminating at the brachiocephalic confluence.  No
 evidence of acute disease.
