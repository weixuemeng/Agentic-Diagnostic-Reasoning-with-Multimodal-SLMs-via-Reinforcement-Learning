                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased responsiveness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 appearing top normal.  Focal contour abnormality at the level of the aortic
 arch corresponds to the known pseudoaneurysm which was better depicted on the
 previous CT.  Calcified hilar lymph nodes are re- demonstrated. Architectural
 distortion with traction bronchiectasis and fibrotic changes are noted in both
 upper lobes, right greater than left, likely related to prior granulomatous
 infection.  Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe peripherally was present on
 the prior CT, and again may reflect an area of infection.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded, and there are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic changes with architectural distortion most pronounced in the upper
 lobes compatible with prior granulomatous disease.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, unchanged.  Right basilar patchy opacity was seen on the recent
 chest CT, and may reflect an area of infection.  Retrocardiac opacity could
 reflect atelectasis though infection is also not excluded.
