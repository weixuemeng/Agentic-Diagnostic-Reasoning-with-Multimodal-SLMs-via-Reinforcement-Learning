                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ARDS and right pneumothorax.  Right chest tube manipulated. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right pleural catheter ends at the right lung apex, not significantly changed.
 An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm with its side
 port just below the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  A severe
 interstitial abnormality may be minimally improved compared to the prior
 radiograph from earlier today.  Focal lucency at the medial right lung base is
 slightly less conspicuous on the present study, possibly a small pneumothorax
 or extrapleural gas collection.  Marked subcutaneous air has decreased on the
 left, but is not significantly changed on the right.  The heart size remains
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight decrease in conspicuity of lucency along the medial right lung
 base, possibly a tiny pneumothorax versus extrapleural gas collection.
 
 2.  Slight improvement in widespread interstitial opacities.
 
 3.  Large quantity of subcutaneous air overlying the chest, decreased on the
 left, but not significantly changed on the right.
