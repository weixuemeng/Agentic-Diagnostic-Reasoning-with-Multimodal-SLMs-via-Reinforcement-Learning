 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:11 PM
  Right pleural catheter ends at the right lung apex, as before.  Endotracheal
  tube terminates 1.3 cm above the level of the carina, with neck in slight
  flexion; to prevent self-intubation of the right mainstem bronchus, the
  endotracheal tube could be withdrawn by 1-2 cm.  Bilateral predominantly mid
  to lower lung heterogeneous opacities have substantially increased compared to
  the radiograph from approximately ___ hr ago, likely indicating
  new/increased moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with concomitant unchanged
  versus slightly worsened background pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
  effusions, left greater than right, are thought likely.  Subcutaneous air
  overlying the right lateral thorax is decreased.  Findings were discussed with
  Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 20:04 via telephone on the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:38 PM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia and pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:02 p.m.:
 
 Severe widespread pulmonary infiltration has worsened, with near confluence of
 opacification in the left lung, an increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
 Right apical pleural tube in place as before.  No pneumothorax.  No
 appreciable right pleural effusion.  Right supraclavicular central venous
 catheter ends low in the SVC, ET tube and upper enteric drainage catheter are
 in standard positions.
