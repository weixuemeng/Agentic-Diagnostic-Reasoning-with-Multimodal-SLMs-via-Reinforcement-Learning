                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Frequent pneumonias, cough, vomiting
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph. ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  No focal consolidation is identified. Increased interstitial markings
 are noted at the lung bases, similar to that seen on the previous exam. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic spine as well as within the AC joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings within the lung bases, similar compared to the
 prior exam.  Findings may be due to mild volume overload but an atypical
 infectious process is not excluded.
