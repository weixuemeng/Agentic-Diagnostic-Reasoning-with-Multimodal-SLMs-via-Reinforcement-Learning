                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD and recent
 pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph were reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  There is substantial
 improvement of the right lower lung consolidations with minimal amount of
 opacity still present.  Pulmonary enlargement is noted bilaterally, most
 likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is currently seen.
