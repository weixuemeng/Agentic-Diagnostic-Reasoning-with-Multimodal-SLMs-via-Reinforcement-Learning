                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS: 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is calcified.  A small oval nodular focus projects along the superior aspect
 of the left hilum.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There are trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Nipple shadows are visualized bilaterally.  The lungs
 appear clear.  The bones appear demineralized.     
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting emphysema including hyperinflation and coarse lung
 markings.  
 
 2.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 3.  Small left suprahilar nodular focus, probably a normal vascular shadow but
 a pulmonary nodule is also possible.  If available, correlation to prior films
 is recommended; if not available to show long-term stability, then chest CT is
 recommended when clinically appropriate to evaluate further.
