                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAD, p/w hypotension, mild hypoxia and
 subacute SOB  // ?e/o pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is substantial. The aortic arch appears to be substantially
 distended with significant right shift of the trachea and should be further
 correlated with chest CT to exclude the possibility of thoracic aneurysm. The
 patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. Lungs are essentially clear. No
 appreciable pleural effusion is seen. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
