                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, evaluate for hilar adenopathy.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is severe cardiomegaly, with evidence for marked left atrial
 enlargement and right as well as left heart enlargement.  The hila are
 prominent, partially obscured by the cardiomediastinal contour.  There is
 upper zone re-distribution.  There are increased interstitial markings at both
 lung bases, in the setting of upper zone re-distribution.  Small effusions are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD.
 
 2.  Marked cardiomegaly.  
 
 3. Likely hilar adenopathy, not optimally visualized due to the cardiomegaly
 and therefore not fully characterized.
 
 4.  UZRD and increased interstitial markings in both mid and lower zones, with
 small pleural effusions.  Compared with ___ at ___ p.m., the interstitial
 markings are less pronounced, suggesting some interval improvement in CHF
 findings.
