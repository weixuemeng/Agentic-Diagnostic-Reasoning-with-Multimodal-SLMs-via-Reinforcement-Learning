                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  
 
 HISTORY:  Vomiting and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again moderate to severely enlarged.  Opacification in
 the retrocardiac area of the left lower lobe persists.  Although it is
 nonspecific as to etiology, it could probably be explained by atelectasis
 associated with marked cardiomegaly.  There is mild upper zone re-distribution
 of pulmonary vascularity but findings suggesting pulmonary congestion are not
 as striking as on the prior examination.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly.  Opacity in the left lower lobe, which is
 nonspecific.  Although pneumonia could be considered, there has been fairly
 little if any change and such an opacity could also be seen with atelectasis
 associated with marked cardiomegaly.
