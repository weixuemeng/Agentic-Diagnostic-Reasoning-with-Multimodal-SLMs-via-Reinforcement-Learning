                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is compatible with underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  Mild pulmonary edema is worse compared to the previous
 exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Retrocardiac
 consolidative opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.
