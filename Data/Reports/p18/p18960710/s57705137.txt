                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Septic from UTI/pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___, CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  An endotracheal tube ends 3.9 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube side port is within the stomach but the tip is
 out of view.  The right internal jugular catheter ends in the lower SVC. The
 only area that suggests new pneumonia is a small region of mild opacification
 in the left apex that is partially obscured by the left first rib. Pulmonary
 edema has resolved. No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible left upper lobe pneumonia.
