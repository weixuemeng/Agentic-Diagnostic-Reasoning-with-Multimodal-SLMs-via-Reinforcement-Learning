                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent head injury.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates lower lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased prominence of the
 right hilum, which was not clearly seen in the prior radiographs.  The degree
 of bibasilar opacification has increased over the interim and may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vessels,
 particularly in the left lung.  An endotracheal tube is seen terminating 4.5
 cm from the carina.  Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter ends
 in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities may represent
 atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Engorged pulmonary vessels, particularly on the
 left lung field, may relate to pulmonary edema.
