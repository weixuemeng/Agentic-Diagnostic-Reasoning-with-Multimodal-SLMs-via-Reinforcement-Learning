                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheoplasty.  Question pneumothorax, edema, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC.
 
 A right-sided chest tube is present.  Trace subcutaneous emphysema noted along
 right chest wall. The upper portion of the lungs are obscured by the patient's
 chin.  Allowing for this, no obvious pneumothorax is identified.  A tiny right
 apical pneumothorax might, however, be obscured.   
 
 There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at both lung bases.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated and the right costophrenic angle is blunted.  No
 CHF, left-sided effusion, or focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: Tiny right pneumothorax could be obscured by the patient's chin. 
 Otherwise, no evidence of pneumothorax.  No significant change compared with
 ___.  No CHF or focal infiltrate.
