 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post tracheoplasty, assess lines and chest tube.
 
 Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  There is a right apical
 chest tube.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.  The patient has
 known loss of volume in the right middle lobe and bibasilar bronchiectasis. 
 Left mid lung atelectasis is new.  Right perihilar opacity is likely
 atelectasis.  Attention on this area should be paid in followup study.  There
 is a small right subcutaneous emphysema.  There is a tiny right apical
