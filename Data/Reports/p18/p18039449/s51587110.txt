                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with left chest pain after fall, evaluate for
 pneumothorax or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 resulting in accentuation of pulmonary vasculature.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes accentuating pulmonary vasculature.
 2.  No displaced rib fracture.  Of note, conventional chest radiography is not
 sensitive for detection of rib fractures.
