                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post craniotomy for meningioma.  Evaluate new endotracheal
 tube and central venous line placements.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable radiograph of the chest shows a new right internal jugular central
 venous line with the tip in the low SVC.  The endotracheal tube tip projects
 approximately 1 cm from the carina.  This should be retracted by approximately
 2 cm for proper positioning.  The lung volumes are decreased compared to the
 prior study with bibasilar atelectasis and increased opacities at the left
 base, suggestive of aspiration.  The cardiac shadow is exaggerated due to the
 low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Satisfactory positioning of right internal jugular central venous line.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube tip projects 1 cm from the carina.  This should be
 retracted by roughly 2 cm for proper positioning.
 
 3. Increased opacity at the left base suggestive of aspiration.  Follow up
 radiographs are recommended.  
 
 These findings were relayed to Dr. ___, by Dr. ___, at 17:22, at the
 time of discovery.
