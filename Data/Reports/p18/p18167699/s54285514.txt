                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent pneumonia // assess for clearing
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is right middle lobe peribronchial opacification. Without prior film of
 the recent pneumonia, it is difficult to be certain, but presumably this is a
 clearing of right middle lobe pneumonia.  Alternatively this can be
 bronchiectasis.  Compared to the chest radiograph from ___, the opacification
 is more conspicuous.  There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax. Emphysematous changes in the bilateral lung apices, more so on
 the right than left, are similar compared to ___. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal size and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe peribronchial opacification appears more conspicuous
 compared to ___. Without prior film of the recent pneumonia, it is difficult
 to be certain, but presumably this is a clearing of right middle lobe
 pneumonia. Alternatively this can be bronchiectasis.
