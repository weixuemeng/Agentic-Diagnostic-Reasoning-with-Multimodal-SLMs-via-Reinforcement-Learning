                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man after placement of a right internal jugular
 central venous line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in the
 supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___ at 17:42.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular vein which
 terminates within the upper SVC. No complications following the procedure are
 seen, and there continue to be low lung volumes without focal consolidation
 pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. The heart continues to be enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line without
 complications, though evaluation for pneumothorax is sub-optimal on a supine
 radiograph.
