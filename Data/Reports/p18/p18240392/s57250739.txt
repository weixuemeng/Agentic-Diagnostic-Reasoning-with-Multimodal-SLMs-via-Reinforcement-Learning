                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest wall pain and right wrist pain.  Evaluate for
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No displaced
 rib fracture is detected, although chest radiography has limited sensitivity
 for rib fractures.
