                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, evaluate aortic contour.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The superior most
 wire is fractured.  Lucency in the upper lobes in comparison to the more
 inferior lungs suggests pulmonary emphysema.   Increased bibasilar right
 greater than left opacities may be due to chronic changes and underlying COPD;
 however, infection is not excluded, particularly in the right lower lung. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Chain sutures are noted
 projecting over right middle lobe.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  The mediastinum is not widened. Aortic
 contour is within normal limits.
