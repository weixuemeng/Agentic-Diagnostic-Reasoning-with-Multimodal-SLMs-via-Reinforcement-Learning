                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient now presents with a frontal and lateral radiograph. 
 The lung volumes are low.  At the lung bases, there are extensive zones of
 atelectasis, in part due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  As noted in
 the previous report, co-existing pneumonia in this location cannot be
 excluded.  Larger effusions are not seen.  Mild cardiomegaly with mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
