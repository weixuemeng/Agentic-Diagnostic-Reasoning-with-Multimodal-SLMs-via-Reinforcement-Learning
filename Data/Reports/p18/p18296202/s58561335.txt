                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen which could in part relate to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen,
 although small is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult
 to assess due to bibasilar opacities.  The bibasilar opacities could also
 relate to chronic aspiration.
