 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart size
 is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is chronic.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis in the lung bases with chronic elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise
