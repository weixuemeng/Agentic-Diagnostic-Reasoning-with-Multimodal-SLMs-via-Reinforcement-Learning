                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with brain tumor, status post
 resection with anxiety attack, clinical question:  Screening needed for
 placement in psychiatric facility.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  High-positioned diaphragms as identified on the frontal
 view are most likely result of poor inspirational effort in this
 non-cooperative patient.  Crowded appearance of basal pulmonary vasculature is
 observed, and plate linear atelectasis is present bilaterally.  Heart size is
 not clearly identifiable because of the high-positioned diaphragms but
 probably unchanged in comparison with the previous study three days ago.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute parenchymal
 infiltrates are present.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the
 thorax grossly unremarkable.
 Impression:
 Plate atelectasis related to poor inspirational efforts.  No evidence of
 cardiac enlargement, pulmonary congestion, or acute infiltrates.  Stable
 conditions in comparison with the next previous similar study obtained three
 days earlier.
