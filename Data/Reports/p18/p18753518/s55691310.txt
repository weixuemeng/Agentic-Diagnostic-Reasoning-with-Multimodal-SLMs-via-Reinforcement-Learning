                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from earlier today from an outside hospital as well
 as one dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Since the study
 performed earlier today, there is relative increase in the overall conspicuity
 of the interstitial markings which could represent interstitial edema or
 bronchovascular crowding.  No frank signs of overt edema or definite signs of
 pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of mild interstitial prominence which could reflect
 the development of mild edema.
