                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube and NG tube are unchanged.  There is
 increased pulmonary vascular re-distribution with hazy bilateral infiltrates
 compatible with fluid overload; superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  A
 device with a spring is superimposed over the right main stem bronchus but is
 unclear what the etiology of this is and is likely overlying the patient. 
 Recommend clinical correlation.
