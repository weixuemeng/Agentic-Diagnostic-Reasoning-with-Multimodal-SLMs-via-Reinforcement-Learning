                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a PMH of HTN, prostate cancer who presents with fever
 and AMS, found to have lactic acidosis and hyperbilirubinemia and a dilated
 BCD on CT c/w___ transferred from OSH for ERCP, after inability to
 complete ERCP at OSH.  // Check ET tube and og tube placement   Check ET tube

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is
 again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  This discordance raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy or possibly even pericardial effusion.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is seen with some opacification in the
 retrocardiac region, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung and
 small pleural effusion.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  The orogastric tube is very difficult to see, though it appears to
 extend to at least the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image.  An abdomen examination could be obtained to definitely see the tip of
 the tube.
