                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SW to L chest wall, +pericardial effusion on FAST s/p
 pericardial window, sternotomy, oversew stab wound to right ventricle, now
 with fevers  // cardiopulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube was removed.  The alignment of the sternal wires is constant.
 The lung volumes have decreased, as expected.  As a consequence, bilateral
 areas of atelectasis are seen at the lung bases.  Moderate cardiomegaly with
 minimal fluid overload but no pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal view.
