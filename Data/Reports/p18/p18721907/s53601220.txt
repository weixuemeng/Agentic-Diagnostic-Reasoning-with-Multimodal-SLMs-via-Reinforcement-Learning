                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // evaluate for pneumothorax, ACS
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiomediastinal contours and result
 in bronchovascular crowding.  Within this context, prominence of the right
 mediastinal contour is likely technical in nature.  Lungs are clear and there
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent right cardiomediastinal contour is probably due to accentuation by a
 technical factors.  Recommend nonurgent repeat radiographs with improved
 inspiratory level when the patient's condition permits.  .
