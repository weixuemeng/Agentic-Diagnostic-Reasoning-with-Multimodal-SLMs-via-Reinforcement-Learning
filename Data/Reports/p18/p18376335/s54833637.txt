 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, distended loops of bowel are
 incompletely imaged and cannot be fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.  
 
 2.  Incompletely imaged bowel distention in upper abdomen.  If symptoms are
 referable to the abdomen, dedicated abdominal radiographs would be suggested.
