                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:40 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, assess tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has strong component of
 pulmonary edema which has worsened in the left lung, but there has been some
 improvement in the more consolidated right lung since earlier in the day
 despite lower lung volumes which would exaggerate the severity of the
 abnormality instead.  Moderate cardiomegaly, unusual in a patient of this age
 is stable.  Azygos distention suggests volume overload.  ET tube and upper
 enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.  Some right pleural effusion
 is presumed, but not large.  No pneumothorax.
