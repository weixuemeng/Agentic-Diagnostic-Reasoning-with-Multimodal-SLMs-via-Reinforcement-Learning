                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ingestion, now with fever.  Evaluate for aspiration
 or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a
 supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examinations, there is stable
 opacification of the right upper lobe, consistent with aspiration versus
 pneumonia.  The lung volumes are decreased, which leads to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  The remainder of the lungs are essentially clear
 without additional focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. An
 endotracheal tube is noted to be in place terminating 2.8 cm above the level
 of the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen passing into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable opacification of the right upper lobe, likely secondary to aspiration
 versus pneumonia.
