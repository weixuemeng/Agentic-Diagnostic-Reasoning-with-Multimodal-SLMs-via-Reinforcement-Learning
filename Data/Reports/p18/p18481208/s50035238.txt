                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ingestion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest was obtained with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___ at
 8:21.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, the patient demonstrates opacification
 of the entire right lung, likely secondary to aspiration versus pneumonia. 
 Additionally, the left lung demonstrates airspace disease suggestive of
 interstitial pulmonary edema, new since the prior examination.  Mild to
 moderate stable cardiomegaly is noted.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 essentially unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval progression of the patient's aspiration versus pneumonia, now
 involving the entire right lung.  
 
 2. Probable mild to moderate pulmonary edema, new from the prior exam.
