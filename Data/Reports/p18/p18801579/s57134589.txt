 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p r chest tube placement  // r/o Right PTx     
 r/o Right PTx
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter has evacuated much of the
 previous moderate right pleural effusion, but the lung has failed to re-expand
 and the space is now filled with air.  The absence of pneumothorax elsewhere
 in the right hemi thorax a indicates pleural adhesions loculated in the basal
 compartment from the rest of the chest.
 
 Previous mild edema in the left lung has cleared.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.
