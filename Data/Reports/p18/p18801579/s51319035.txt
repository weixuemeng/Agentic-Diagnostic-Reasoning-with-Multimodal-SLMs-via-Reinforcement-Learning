                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, LLE swelling  // evidence of dvt or
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiograph views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available on PACs at the time of this
 dictation.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is opacification of the right lower hemi thorax. 
 The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated and the mediastinum appears slightly
 shifted rightward, suggesting volume loss.  On the lateral view, no definite
 large pleural effusion is identified.  There is increased opacification on the
 lateral view of the lower portions of the spine.  No pneumothorax.  The left
 lung is clear.  The heart appears slightly enlarged.  Exaggerated rightward
 deviation of the thoracic trachea on the frontal view may be positional.  The
 descending aorta appears slightly tortuous.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 are mild of the visualized thoracic spine.  There is nonspecific gaseous
 distension of visualized bowel loops in the left upper quadrant.  No acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower hemithorax opacification which may reflect consolidation and/or
 atelectasis.
