                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with likely CHF exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears moderately enlarged, similar to the prior study. The aorta
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications diffusely.  There is mild
 pulmonary edema, worse in the interval with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 slightly increased on the right.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so
 on the right may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Mild to moderate degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  More focal right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
