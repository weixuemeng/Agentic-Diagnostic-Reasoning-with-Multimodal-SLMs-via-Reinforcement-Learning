                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Indistinct
 bronchovascular markings and cephalization of pulmonary vessels is compatible
 with pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  Bilateral
 costophrenic angles are indistinct, suggesting small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Mildly enlarged heart size is similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly.
