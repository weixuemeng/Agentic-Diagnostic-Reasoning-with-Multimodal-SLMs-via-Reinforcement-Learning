 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and stable from previous
 studies.  There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta

 improvement of right lower lobe opacity though bilateral small pleural
 effusions persist with pulmonary vascular prominence making pneumonia less
 likely.
