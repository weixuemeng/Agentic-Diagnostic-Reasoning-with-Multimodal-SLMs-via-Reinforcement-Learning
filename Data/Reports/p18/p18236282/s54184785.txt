                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nausea, vomiting, productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  The lungs are hyperexpanded,
 similar to prior CT.  Lingular nodule is vaguely seen in the left suprahilar
 region.  Bibasilar ground-glass opacities correspond to overlying pectoralis
 muscle.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Lingular nodule better seen on
 previous CT, and per prior report, nonurgent followup CT should be performed
 to document stability.
