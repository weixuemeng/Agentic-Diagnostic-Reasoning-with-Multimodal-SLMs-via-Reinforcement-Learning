                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There has been placement of a dual-channel
 pacemaker device with the leads in the areas of the right atrium and apex of
 the right ventricle.  Specifically, no pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with left ventricular prominence, but no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  On the frontal view, there appears to be a
 rounded opacification containing gas in the retrocardiac region, consistent
 with a hiatal hernia.
