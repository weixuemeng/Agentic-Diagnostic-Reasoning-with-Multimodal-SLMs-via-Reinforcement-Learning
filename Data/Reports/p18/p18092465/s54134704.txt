                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The lung volumes are low.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Crowding of
 basilar lung markings on the lateral view is probably due to low lung volumes.
 The bony structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
