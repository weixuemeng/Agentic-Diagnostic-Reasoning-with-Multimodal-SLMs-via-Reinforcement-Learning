                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Swallowed chicken bone.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from the same day.  Question mediastinal air.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The heart
 size is top normal.  No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pneumonia.  There
 is no evidence of pneumomediastinum on this radiograph. The patient's known
 swallowed chicken bone is seen at the very edge of the film; no other foreign
 bodies are present. The trachea is midline. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumomediastinum on this radiograph; a tiny
 amount of mediastinal air near the carina on the CT of the neck from the same
 day is beyond the resolution of chest x-ray.
