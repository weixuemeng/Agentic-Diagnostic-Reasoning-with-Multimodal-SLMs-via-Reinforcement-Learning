                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with colonic obstruction, evaluate for preop tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiographic view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An enteric tube courses inferiorly in the midline, with distal side port seen
 approximately 3.5 cm distal to the GE junction, with tip projecting over the
 approximate location of the gastric body in the left upper abdominal quadrant.
 There are low lung volumes and a suboptimal inspiratory effort.  There is at
 least moderate cardiomegaly.  There are aortic arch calcifications.  The
 bilateral hila are within normal limits.  There is bibasilar atelectasis. 
 There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  There is no focal lung consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enteric tube in grossly appropriate location, with tip likely in the
 gastric body.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly and likely some component of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No focal lung consolidation.
 3. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect relaxation atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
