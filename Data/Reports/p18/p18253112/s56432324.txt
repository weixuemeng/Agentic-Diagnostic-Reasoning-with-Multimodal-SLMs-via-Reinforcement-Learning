                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations of technique, there is no
 definite acute abnormality.  Patchy opacity in the right lower lung, probably
 in the right lower lobe, is likely due to minor atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis.  Low lung
 volumes.  Follow-up radiographs could be considered if the possibility of
 developing infection is a strong persistent clinical concern, although
 doubtful.
