                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is accentuated as result, appearing
 mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob remains calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are relatively unchanged.  There is mild crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.
