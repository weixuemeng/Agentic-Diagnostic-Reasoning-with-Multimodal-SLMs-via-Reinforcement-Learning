                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, which exaggerates the heart size which is top normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification of the aortic
 arch re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures,
 with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly
 indicate trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
