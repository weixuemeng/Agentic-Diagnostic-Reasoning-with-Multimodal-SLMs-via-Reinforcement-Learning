                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 Dense streak of atelectasis is seen at the left base.  Mild fullness of
 pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though
 much of this could be a manifestation of low lung volumes.
