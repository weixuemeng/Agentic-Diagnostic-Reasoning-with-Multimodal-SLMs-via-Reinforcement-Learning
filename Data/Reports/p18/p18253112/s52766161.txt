                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart size is difficult
 to evaluate.  Aside from a linear opacity projecting over the left mid lung,
 suggesting minor lingular atelectasis or scarring, the lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no definite evidence of acute disease. 
 Minor left basilar atelectasis and lingular scarring or atelectasis.
