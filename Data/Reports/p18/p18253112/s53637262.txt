 HISTORY:  Fever and hypoxia after hemodialysis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes which limits the assessment of the lung bases. 
 There is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess, but likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no
 overt pulmonary edema is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which limits the assessment of the lung bases.  Probable mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.
