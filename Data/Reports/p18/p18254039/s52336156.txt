                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fatigue as well as chest heaviness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is a widespread upper lung predominant interstitial abnormality throughout
 both lungs that is chronic in appearance, thought to be attributable to
 sarcoidosis.  A 7-mm nodular opacity in the left mid-to-upper lung is not
 significantly changed compared to the prior radiograph from ___.  There is no focal consolidation.  Calcified mediastinal/hilar
 lymphadenopathy is similar in appearance.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change in chronic widespread interstitial
 abnormality or previously identified 7-mm left upper lung rounded opacity.
 
 2.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
