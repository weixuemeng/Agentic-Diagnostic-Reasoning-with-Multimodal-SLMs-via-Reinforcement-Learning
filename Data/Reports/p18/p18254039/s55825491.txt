                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of sarcoidosis, left
 upper lung nodule and recent hospitalization at OSH, no medical records. 
 Followup x-ray for pneumonia at an outside hospital.  Study requested to
 evaluate known left upper lung nodule and interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___ and prior chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 Extensive peribronchial opacities which predominantly occupy the upper lung
 lobes, right worse than left and affecting predominantly the right perihilar
 region, are consistent with known diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  There is
 calcified mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pneumonia,
 pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  Left upper lung rounded opacity has not
 significantly changed from prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Extensive interstitial changes consistent with known diagnosis of
 sarcoidosis and unchanged left upper lung rounded opacity.
