 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough with fever.  Assess for pneumonia.

 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are somewhat low in
 volume with linear left basilar opacities, most likely atelectasis.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is top normal in size and
 intervally increased over the prior two days which may reflect pericardial
 effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Linear left basal opacities most likely atelectasis. Interval
 increase in size of cardiac silhouette over the past few days could reflect
 pericardial effusion.
