                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with diabetes and CHF.  Smoker with six weeks of
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with chest
 CT on ___.
 
 Hyperinflation reflects emphysema.  Extensive nodulation projecting over the
 lungs is largely pleural plaques, mostly calcified.  Interval change in the
 conspicuity of a cluster of nodules in the right lower chest at the level of
 the anterior eighth rib is probably a function of increasing calcification. 
 It would be reasonable, however, to repeat a chest CT scan at this time since
 it would be difficult to exclude a lung nodule in the same region.  There is
 no consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes
 are normal.
