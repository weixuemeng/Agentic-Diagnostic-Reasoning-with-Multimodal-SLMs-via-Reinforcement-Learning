                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male status post right lower lobe lobectomy.  Assess for interval
 change, atelectasis, or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate right lower lobe atelectasis.  Two stable rounded
 homogeneous opacities project over the anterior fifth rib are likely pleural
 in etiology.  Left lung is clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart
 size, mediastinal contour, and hila are normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Two rounded homogeneous pleural densities are unchanged; however, if
 clinical concern, consider repeat radiograph in six weeks to assess for
 interval change.
