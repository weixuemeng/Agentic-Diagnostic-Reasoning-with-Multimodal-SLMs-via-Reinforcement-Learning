                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Patchy opacities in the right mid and left lower lungs appear unchanged while
 perhaps the only change is increasing nodular foci in the left mid lung,
 probably localizing to the lingula or left lower lobe.  A mild compression of
 T12 is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar opacities in the right.  New nodular focus projecting
 over the left lower lung, possibly a nipple shadow, but potentially a nodule. 
 Repeat PA view with nipple markers is recommended when clinically appropriate
 to reassess.  Similar mild chronic compression deformity of T12.
