                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with oropharyngeal cancer  // S/p tracheostomy.
 Please assess for PTX.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube in situ.  The current single view does not provide evidence
 for the presence of a pneumothorax.  However, if possible, the image should be
 complemented with the lateral radiograph. Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette. Retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus could be caused by a small left pleural effusion.
