  1. Persistent moderate left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity likely
  representing combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis however differential
  includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
  2. Persistent right lower lobe opacity with small right pleural effusion is
  most consistent with atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia or
  aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia. Assess for pneumonia or pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates persistent moderate left
 pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity and decreased left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity with trace right pleural
 effusion.  Mild vascular engorgement noted.  Stable appearance of
 tracheostomy.  Limited evaluation of heart size due to underlying lung
 abnormality.No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Degenerative
 changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable moderate left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity likely

 includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Decreased left lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity with small right pleural effusion is
 most consistent with atelectasis however differential includes pneumonia or
 aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 4.  Mild vascular engorgement.
