 Hyperinflation indicates COPD.  Left trans venous right atrial and ventricular
 pacer leads are continuous from the left pectoral generator.
 
 Left pleural calcification probably originated with healed rib fractures. 
 Blunting of the posterior pleural sulci is probably due to scarring or U
 erosion of the diaphragm due to hyper inflation, but not pleural effusion. 
 There is no pulmonary edema or evidence of cardiac decompensation.
