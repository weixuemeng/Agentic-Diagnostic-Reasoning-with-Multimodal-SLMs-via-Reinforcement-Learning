                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and has minimally increased
 in size since the previous study.  Additionally, there has been slight
 increase in caliber of the pulmonary vessels which appear indistinct and are
 accompanied by peribronchial cuffing and a bilateral interstitial pattern with
 a basilar predominance.  Upper lobe predominant emphysema is again
 demonstrated as well as an area of linear scarring in the left upper lobe.  In
 addition to bilateral interstitial opacities, heterogeneous, more confluent
 areas of opacity have developed at the bases, greater than right.  No definite
 pleural effusion, but there is slight thickening of the fissures bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New radiographic findings which could reflect an asymmetrical
 pattern of congestive heart failure superimposed upon chronic emphysema.
 Coexisting pneumonia should be considered, especially particularly in the left
 lower lobe.  Followup chest radiograph after diuresis may be helpful for
 initial further evaluation.
