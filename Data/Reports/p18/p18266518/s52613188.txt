                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged but unchanged. Aortic knob
 calcifications are again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes re- demonstrated, most
 pronounced in the upper lobes.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus on the frontal
 view is unchanged, and could relate to pleural thickening. Linear scarring
 within the left upper lobe is unchanged. Mild interstitial prominence at the
 lung bases is improved compared to the previous exam and may reflect chronic
 changes. Remote right-sided rib fractures are noted.  No subdiaphragmatic free
 air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
