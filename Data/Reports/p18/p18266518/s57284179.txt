                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Productive cough, yellow sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 chronically increased interstitial markings bilaterally, which may be due to
 chronic lung disease.  In comparison to ___, findings appear worsened
 which may be due to superimposed edema.  There is bibasilar atelectasis and
 mild biapical pleural thickening.  Right middle lobe patchy opacity seen in
 both the frontal and lateral views, which may relate to atelectasis and
 scarring; however, superimposed infectious process or aspiration is not
 excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronically increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggest
 chronic lung disease with possible superimposed edema.  Patchy somewhat linear
 right middle lobe opacities could relate to atelectasis and/or scarring;
 however, superimposed infectious process is not excluded.
