                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with residual aphasia and right hemiparesis
 status post chocking event.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear of
 confluent consolidation.  There is however a rounded opacity projecting over
 the right 2nd rib anteriorly, not seen on prior. There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Increased pulmonary vascular markings suggest mild
 interstitial edema, however, this is improved since prior.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged, similar to prior.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications again noted at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Mild interstitial edema and persistent bilateral effusions.  
 Rounded opacity projecting over the right lung apex, potentially summation of
 shadows however nonurgent repeat PA suggested when patient is amenable to
 exclude underlying parenchymal lesion.
