                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of chest pain.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly has been stable compared to exams dating back to at least ___.  Aortic knob calcifications are redemonstrated, otherwise the
 hilar and mediastinal contours demonstrate mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Diffuse hazy opacities overlying the lung fields bilaterally, as
 well as interstitial thickening is secondary to moderate pulmonary edema. 
 There is an additional opacity in the left retrocardiac region.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions appear new compared to the CT from ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema. 
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity may be secondary to a summation effect of the
 patient's pulmonary edema, however an acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded. 
 
 3.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
