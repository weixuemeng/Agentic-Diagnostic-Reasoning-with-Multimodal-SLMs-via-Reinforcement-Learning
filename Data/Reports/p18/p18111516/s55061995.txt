                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chills and low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 again prominent.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is mild interstitial abnormality suggesting
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is patchy new retrocardiac opacity
 associated with a left-sided pleural effusion, probably small in size.  There
 is also an opacity in the posterior basal right lower lobe concerning for
 pneumonia and visible on both views.  Slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a coinciding pleural effusion.  Fissures are
 slightly thickened.  A surgical clip projects over the upper abdomen.  Slight
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate
 setting, although other etiologies such as atelectasis associated with a small
 pleural effusion could explain the finding.
 
 2.  Widespread mild interstitial abnormality with new pleural effusion and
 thickened fissures, suggesting vascular congestion.
