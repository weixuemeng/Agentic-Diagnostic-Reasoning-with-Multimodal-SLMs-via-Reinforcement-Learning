                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky retrocardiac and
 right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions cannot be completely excluded posteriorly.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Clip is noted within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions posteriorly also likely
 present.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
