                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Swelling and pitting edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's overlying arm partially obscures the view on the
 lateral view.  Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Subtle
 upper paratracheal opacity is stable.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable, with the cardiac silhouette enlarged.  Degenerative changes are
 seen in the partially imaged shoulder joints and the acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
