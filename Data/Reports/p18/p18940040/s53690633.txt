                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post left thoracentesis who presents
 for interval evaluation. Question of right lung process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is mildly tortuous,
 otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are stable. There has been
 interval improvement of the right lower right lung base heterogeneous
 opacities, which were likely from re-expansion edema. New left lung base
 opacities may be secondary to re-expansion edema. There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite pneumothorax is
 seen. There is kyphosis of the spine. There is a wedge-compression deformity
 of the low-thoracic spine, which appears to be progressed from the CT of ___, but stable since the exam from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of right lung re-expansion edema compared to the
 prior exam.
 
 2.  New left lung base mild re-expansion edema. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Wedge-compression deformity of the low-thoracic spine, progressed from CT
 of ___, but stable since the exam from ___.
