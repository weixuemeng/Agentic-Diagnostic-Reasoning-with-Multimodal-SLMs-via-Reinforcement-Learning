 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of small to moderate size bilateral
 pleural effusions, new compared to the prior radiographs.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Clips are seen projecting over the right superolateral chest.  Severe
 compression deformity at T12 appears progressed since the prior CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 
 2. Progression of T12 compression deformity which is now severe.
