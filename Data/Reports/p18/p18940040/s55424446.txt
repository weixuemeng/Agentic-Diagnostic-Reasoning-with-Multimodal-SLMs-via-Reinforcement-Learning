  Small residual left pleural effusion, status post left thoracentesis.  No
  definite pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous right lower lung opacities are increased
  compared to the most recent study from ___, possibly aspiration
  pneumonitis versus developing infection, although atelectasis could have a
  similar appearance.  Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.  Findings were
  discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 19:12 via telephone on the day

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post left thoracentesis who presents
 for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and
 CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly, stable compared to prior exams at least
 dating back to ___.  The aorta is tortuous, otherwise the hilar
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a small left pleural effusion
 status post left thoracentesis.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 heterogeneous right lower lung opacities likely secondary to re-expansion
 edema given patient's thoracentesis on ___. There is mild left
 lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of the small left pleural effusion status post
 thoracentesis.  No definite pneumothorax.
 
 2.  New heterogeneous right lower lung opacity, likely secondary to
 re-expansion edema s/p patient's right sided thoracentesis on ___.
