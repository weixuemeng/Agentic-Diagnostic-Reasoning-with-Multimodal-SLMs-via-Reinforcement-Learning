                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of pulmonary nodules and
 ___ pounds unintentional weight loss.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  There is mild cardiac enlargement.  The
 configuration is favoring a prominence of the left ventricular contour.  This
 finding in conjunction with the generally widened and markedly elongated
 thoracic aorta is suggestive of systemic hypertension.  The pulmonary
 vasculature, however, is not congested and there is no evidence of acute new
 infiltrates or pleural effusion in either lateral or posterior pleural
 sinuses.  As shown on previous examinations, there are multiple
 well-demarcated nodular densities, mostly on the right lung base, but these
 have not changed significantly.  The patient had undergone two chest CTs on
 ___, ___, which showed that these nodules were stable
 and probably represented rheumatic lesions in this patient with known history
 of rheumatoid arthritis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of new pulmonary
 abnormalities.
