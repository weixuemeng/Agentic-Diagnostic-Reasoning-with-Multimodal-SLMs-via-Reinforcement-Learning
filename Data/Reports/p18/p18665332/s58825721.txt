                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and ___; chest CT
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable within
 limitations of technique.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a hazy right basilar opacity, possibly developing
 pneumonia versus atelectasis.  Projecting over the left mid lung are two
 suspected small discrete nodules.  Streaky basilar opacities may be due to
 minor atelectasis.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Patchy right basilar opacity, possibly pneumonia, new since the prior
 study; patchy atelectasis could also be considered.  Clinical correlation is
 advised. 
 
 2.  Persistent suspected small nodules in the left mid lung probably
 correlating with prior findings.
