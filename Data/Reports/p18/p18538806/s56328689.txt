                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary artery
 bypass surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared
 to the prior study.  Focal contour deformity of the descending thoracic aortic
 contour just above the left hemidiaphragm is similar to prior radiograph of
 ___ and may reflect either tortuosity or dilation of this
 structure.  Superior mediastinum and lung apices are obscured by flexed
 position of the patient's neck.  However, please see separately dictated CT
 neck exam, which includes assessment of the superior mediastinum and lung
 apices.
