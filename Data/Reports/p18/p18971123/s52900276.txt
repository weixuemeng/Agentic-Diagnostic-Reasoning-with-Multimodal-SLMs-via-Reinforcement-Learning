 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with eating disorder protocol s/p dubhoff tube
 which patient manipulated tonight.  // Please confirm position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right subclavian approach PICC line tip projects over the expected region
 of the distal SVC, unchanged.  The Dobhoff tube has been retracted compared to
 the prior exam and its tip now projects over the expected region of the
 stomach - is likely just past the GE junction and should be advanced at least
 5 cm.  The lungs are otherwise well expanded and clear.  No focal
 consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or large pneumothorax.  The right lung
 apex is cut off from the image.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dobhoff tube terminates in the proximal stomach.  Advancement is suggested for
 standard positioning.
