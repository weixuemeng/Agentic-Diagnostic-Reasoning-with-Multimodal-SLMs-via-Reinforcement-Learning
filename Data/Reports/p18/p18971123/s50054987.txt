                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with eating disorder  // placement of NGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest centered at the level of the
 diaphragms including the upper abdomen and excluding extreme upper portion of
 the chest.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 A Dobhoff type tube is present, with radiopaque tip overlying the expected
 site of the gastric body. Note is made that there appears to be a central wire
 within a catheter, with a radiolucent segment between the central linear
 density and the radiopaque tip of the catheter. An additional vertically
 oriented catheter probably represents portion of the Dobhoff outside the
 patient.
 
 A right subclavian PICC line is present -- the tip is partially obscured by
 the other catheter, but likely lies at the SVC/RA junction similar to the
 prior study. No obvious pneumothorax is identified, though as noted, the
 extreme upper edge of the apices is excluded.
 
 The lungs are grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  A partially visualized bowel gas
 pattern is grossly unremarkable. Mild sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar
 spine, with rotary component in the lumbar spine, is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiopaque segment of distal Dobhoff type tube overlies the expected location
 of the gastric body.  Please see comment above.
 
 No free air or dilated loops of  air filled bowel detected in the visualized
 portion of the upper abdomen.
 
 Minimal hazy atelectasis at the left lung base.
 
 Probable sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
