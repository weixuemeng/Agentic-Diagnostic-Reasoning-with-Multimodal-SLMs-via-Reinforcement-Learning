  A small layering left sided effusion is likely present and stable in
  comparison to the prior study from the same day. Given the patient's recent
  surgical history, hemorrhage must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
  Otherwise, stable post-operative changes including an enlarged
  cardiomediastinal silhouette, mild edema, and multiple support structures.
  Continued followup recommended.
