                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with ESRD, hematemesis, evaluate for free air,
 pneumomediastinum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, with unchanged cardiomegaly. 
 The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is no
 evidence of pneumomediastinum.  Fractures of indeterminate age are seen
 involving several lower left lateral ribs, possibly present on priors but not
 as well-visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum. 
 Stable cardiomegaly.
 2. Fractures of indeterminate age are seen involving several lower left
 lateral ribs, possibly present on priors but not as well- visualized.
