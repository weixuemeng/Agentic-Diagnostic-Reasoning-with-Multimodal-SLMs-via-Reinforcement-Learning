                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HF exacerbation  // ? degree of pulmonary
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is marked poly chamber cardiomegaly. Allowing for technical differences,
 the appearance is similar, but probably slightly worse, compared to ___, and definitely increased compared with ___. The water bottle
 configuration raises the question of pericardial effusion.  The aortic knob
 does not appear dilated.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, possible mild vascular blurring, and small
 bilateral effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis. This appearance is similar to
 the prior film. Prominence of the right hilum is also similar. Background
 hyperinflation raises question of background COPD.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly, slightly increased compared with ___. Is there
 concern for pericardial effusion?
 2. Mild CHF with small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Prominence of the right hilum, unchanged compared with ___.
 Attention to this area on followup films, after resolution of acute symptoms,
 is requested.
 4. Possible background COPD.
