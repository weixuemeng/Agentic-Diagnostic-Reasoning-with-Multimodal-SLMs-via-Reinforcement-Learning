                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper respiratory tract like symptoms with wheezes on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Rounded opacity projecting adjacent to the superior
 aspect of the right heart border is unchanged, possibly a pulmonary vein.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal streaky opacity in the
 retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis, but early infection is not
 completely excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be completely excluded.
