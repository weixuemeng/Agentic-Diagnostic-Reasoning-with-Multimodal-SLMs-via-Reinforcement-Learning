                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Right thoracic pain and cough.  History of resection of mediastinal
 mass in ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips project along the mediastinum.  The heart is normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is potentially a trace residual right apical pneumothorax but
 decreased and perhaps fully resolved, compatible with an unremarkable
 post-operative course.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  Moderate rightward
 convex curvature centered at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased pneumothorax.  Although it is difficult to exclude a
 tiny residual pneumothorax, there is no evidence for a substantial residual
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute disease.
