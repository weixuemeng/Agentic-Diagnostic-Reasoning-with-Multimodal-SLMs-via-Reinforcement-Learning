                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right PleurX catheter, followup with previous film.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacities in the lung
 parenchyma bilaterally have decreased.  However, this decrease is more obvious
 on the left than on the right.  At the right lung bases and in the middle
 zones of the lung parenchyma, substantial areas of opacities persist.  The
 chest tube on the right is in unchanged position.  No large pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The bony changes are
 less obvious than on the previous exam, but discontinuity of the cortical
 structures at the level of the scapula is now visible.
