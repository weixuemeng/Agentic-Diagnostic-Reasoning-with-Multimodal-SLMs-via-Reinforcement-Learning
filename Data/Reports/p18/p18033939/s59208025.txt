                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, question interval change.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, at 8:03 a.m.  
 
 The previously seen left apical pneumothorax is not well visualized on this
 exam and may have resolved.  Otherwise, allowing for technical differences,
 the hemidiaphragms are less well seen on today's exam.  It is unclear whether
 this is due to technical differences (current film obtained is lordotic view)
 or due to interval increase in the degree of opacification at the lung bases. 
 I suspect it is predominantly related to differences in positioning. 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Increased bony density
 consistent with myelofibrosis again noted.
