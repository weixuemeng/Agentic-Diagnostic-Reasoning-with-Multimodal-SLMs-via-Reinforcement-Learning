                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary hypertension, recurrent pleural effusions, and worsening
 shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  A right Pleurx catheter has been
 removed.  Right pleural effusion is stable with similar appearance of
 widespread right lung parenchymal opacities.  Left pleural effusion appears
 slightly increased, also with widespread parenchymal opacities.  No
 pneumothorax.  Moderately severe cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable right and slightly increased left pleural effusions status post removal
 of right Pleurx catheter with stable widespread parenchymal opacities. 
 Findings may represent persistent asymmetric pulmonary edema but metastatic
 pulmonary calcification is a consideration in the setting of chronic renal
 failure and could be confirmed with radionuclide bone scan.
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 on ___ at ___ PM.
