                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CML, pulmonary hypertension, acute kidney injury.  Evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 are larger on the right, probably unchanged, allowing for the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  Increase in size of the right hilus and azygos
 vein is unchanged.  Extensive bilateral ground glass opacity, right greater
 than left, has minimally improved.  There are no new lung abnormalities or
 pneumothorax.
