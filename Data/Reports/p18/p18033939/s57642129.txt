                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, recurrent pleural effusion, right PleurX
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the right
 Pleurx catheter is unchanged.  Overall, the effusion on the right minimally
 progressive as compared to the previous image, the progression is better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  The parenchymal
 opacities in the right lung are not substantially changed as compared to the
 previous image.  There is no evidence for the presence of pneumothorax.
 
 On the left, the effusion is constant in appearance.  Also constant is the
 subsequent atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains unchanged and slightly enlarged.  Unchanged
 appearance of the mediastinal contours.
