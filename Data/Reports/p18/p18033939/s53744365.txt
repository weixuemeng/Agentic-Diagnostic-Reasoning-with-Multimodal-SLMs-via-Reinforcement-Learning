                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with high white count and shortness of breath. 
 Question change in pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not changed appreciably in
 several days.  Pleural effusions are small if any.  Severe cardiomegaly and
 vascular engorgement in both lungs and the mediastinal veins are stable. 
 Compared to ___, the right descending pulmonary artery has enlarged.  This
 is probably due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to severe
 generalized hypoxia.  If on the other hand, there are pulmonary emboli, that
 diagnosis would not explain the diffuse pulmonary opacification.
