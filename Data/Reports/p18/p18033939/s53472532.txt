                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at least moderately enlarged, although its contours
 are difficult to completely assess.  There is a moderate to large pleural
 effusion on the left side, which has increased.  There is probably at least a
 small pleural effusion on the right side.  Diffuse bilateral hazy
 opacification of each lung, although somewhat greater on the right than left,
 is most likely, at least primarily, due to pulmonary edema.  Sclerosis of
 bones may be associated with metabolic abnormalities associated with renal
 failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.  Short-term
 radiographic followup is recommended after diuresis to exclude the possibility
 of coinciding pneumonia.
