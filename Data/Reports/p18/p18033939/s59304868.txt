 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:35 PM
  Once again pulmonary interstitial edema is present.  Small right pleural
  effusion is also present.  It is difficult to discern whether the right middle
  lobe is consolidated.  PA and lateral view may be very helpful in this
  patient.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:52 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CML.  Evaluate for an acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Skinfold projecting over the right lower lung should not be mistaken for an
 intrathoracic abnormality.  However, mild cardiomegaly has progressed and
 there is still severe distention of the right hilus and azygos veins, and
 generalized ground-glass pulmonary abnormality has not resolved, after
 previously improving between ___ and ___.  I doubt that this is
 uncomplicated pulmonary edema, despite the evidence of cardiac decompensation.
