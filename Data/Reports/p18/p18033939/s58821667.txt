                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with myelofibrosis and pulmonary
 hypertension with volume overload and Gram-negative bacteremia, status post
 thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There has been worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity since the previous
 study.  There are diffuse airspace opacities.  Multifocal pneumonia versus
 overt pulmonary edema are likely both present.  There is also likely a
 right-sided pleural effusion.  Increase density at the left apex is likely due
 to overlying external object.
