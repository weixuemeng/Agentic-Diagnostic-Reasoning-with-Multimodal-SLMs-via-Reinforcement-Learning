                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Widening of the mediastinum is again
 consistent with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, worse on the right, which is possibly slightly better than on
 the previous study.
