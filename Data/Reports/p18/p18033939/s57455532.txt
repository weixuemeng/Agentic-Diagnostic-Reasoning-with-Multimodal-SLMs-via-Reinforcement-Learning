                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CML, new right heart failure.  Acute-on-chronic kidney injury
 with persistent shortness of breath despite diuresis.  Assess for interval
 change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as a CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGSl There is significant interval increase in diffuse ground-glass
 opacities throughout both lung fields, right greater than left with a mild
 central predominance.  Stable prominence of the azygos vein and central
 pulmonary vasculature are noted.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Findings
 are most suggestive worsened pulmonary edema, though these findings are
 nonspecific and atypical infection including viral pneumonia or hemorrhage are
 not excluded.  Stable cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in diffuse, predominantly central, faint
 pulmonary opacifications.  Findings are most consistent with pulmonary edema,
 though atypical infections or hemorrhage are not excluded.
