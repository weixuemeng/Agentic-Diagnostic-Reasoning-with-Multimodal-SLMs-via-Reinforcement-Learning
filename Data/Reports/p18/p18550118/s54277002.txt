                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage,
 ventilator requirement, recent left lung collapse on chest x-ray, now status
 post bronchoscopy with aspiration of mucus plug from left lower lobe bronchus
 with lower lobe collapse improved.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is improved aeration in the left upper lobe and in the right
 lung.  Opacification of the left lower lobe with obscuration of the diaphragm
 is consistent with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.    The mediastinum
 is no longer shifted to the left consistent with improved volume loss in the
 upper lobe. There are no definite pleural effusions. There is a left central
 venous catheter which is kinked on introduction to the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration at the left upper lobe and right lung. 
 Slightly improved, but persistent atelectasis at the left lower lobe.
