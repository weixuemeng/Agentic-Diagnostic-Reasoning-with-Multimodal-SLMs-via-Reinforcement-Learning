                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female status post fall, question rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate pulmonary
 hyperexpansion and flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with COPD.
 There may be a new nodule in the left lung superimposed upon the lateral third
 rib. The heart is moderately enlarged, further accentuated by AP technique.  A
 suture chain is seen in the left lung apex.   There are healed fractures of
 the posterior right third and fourth ribs.  No acutely displaced rib fractures
 are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. No displaced rib fracture. If there is further concern for fracture,
 recommend repeat dedicated views with a BB to mark the site of pain.
 
 2. Possible new nodule in the left lung in this patient under surveillance for
 BAC.
