 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic lung cancer, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen
 with regard to the lung parenchyma.  The lung parenchyma is markedly
 overinflated and shows areas of emphysematous destruction, mixed with
 post-operative and post-infectious scars.  There is no new parenchymal opacity
 suggesting pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Marked tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
