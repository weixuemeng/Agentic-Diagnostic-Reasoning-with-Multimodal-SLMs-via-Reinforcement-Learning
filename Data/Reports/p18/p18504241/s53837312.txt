                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___. Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, unchanged from prior
 exams.  Since the most recent chest radiograph on ___, there is
 new diffuse ground glass opacification and increased pulmonary vascular
 engorgement likely reflecting new moderate pulmonary edema.  There is likely a
 small pleural effusion on the right.  There is no definite pleural effusion on
 the left.  There is no consolidation or pneumothorax.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aortic arch is unchanged.  There is no free air under the
 hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema; if concern for pneumonia is present, can obtain
 a chest radiograph post-diuresis.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
