 There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax, the tip of the
 device projects over the lower SVC.
 
 Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with relatively extensive areas
 of atelectasis at the right lung base.  Known and unchanged plate-like
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
