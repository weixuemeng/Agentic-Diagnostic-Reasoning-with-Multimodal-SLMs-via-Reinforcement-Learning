 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  An orogastric tube terminates in
 the stomach.  A patchy right mid-to-lower lung opacity has partly resolved. 
 Left basilar opacities have mostly resolved.  This change confirms the
 likelihood that these opacities were due to atelectatic changes.  A round
 mass-like opacity again projects over the medial right lung apex.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Orogastric tube terminating in the stomach.  Improved aeration of
 both lower lungs.
