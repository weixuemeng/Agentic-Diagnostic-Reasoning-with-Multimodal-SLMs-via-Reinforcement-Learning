                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with bronchial compression.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Hazy opacification is seen of the right hemithorax consistent with
 the history of right middle and upper lobe collapse.  The left basilar
 atelectasis has improved.  Again there is mild leftward displacement of the
 cervical trachea, which could reflect a thyroid mass.
