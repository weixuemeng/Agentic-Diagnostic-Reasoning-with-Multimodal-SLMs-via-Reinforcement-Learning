 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Placement of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina.  The
 heart is probably normal in size.  Projecting over the medial right lung apex
 is a large partly obscured round opacity measuring about 5 cm in diameter. 
 There are several possible etiologies including a mass lesion, aneurysm, or
 perhaps less likely, a loculated fluid collection.  There are streaky
 opacities at the left lung base and a right mid lung opacity; atelectasis or
 pneumonia could be considered for these.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 which may reflect a variety of etiologies including potentially a subpulmonic
 effusion, noting minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  
 
 2.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases.  Correlation with clinical
 presentation is recommended.  Atelectasis or pneumonia could be considered for
 these.  
 
 3.  Round opacity in the right upper hemithorax with a mass-like appearance. 
 If the etiology for this lesion is not already known and understood, then
 chest CT, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible, is suggested, in
 addition to correlation with any prior available imaging.
