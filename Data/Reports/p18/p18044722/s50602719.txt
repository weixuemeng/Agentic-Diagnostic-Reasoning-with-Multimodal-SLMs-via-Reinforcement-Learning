                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with suspected bilateral pneumonia.  Evaluate for
 consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the enteric tube and left IJ central line.
 
 The heart is top-normal in size.  Compared with the prior radiographs,
 residual airspace opacities in the right lower lung zone may reflect
 pneumonia.  There is diffuse right lung bronchial wall thickening.  The left
 lower lobe opacities are however improved.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions, best appreciated on the lateral view.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Partially imaged air-filled loops of bowel project over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persisting right lower lung zone consolidation. New diffuse right lung
 fine septal thickening with airspace opacities may reflect atypical pneumonia
 versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
