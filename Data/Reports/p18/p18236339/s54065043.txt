                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough with productive green sputum, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Right lung is
 clear.  Inferior to left pulmonary hilum is an irregular opacity which could
 represent a confluence of bronchovascular markings, though the possibility of
 nodule cannot be excluded.  Given the lack of recent prior studies, consider
 non-emergent CT to further assess.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or
 CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Irregular opacity inferior to the left pulmonary hilum, unclear
 etiology.  Consider non-emergent CT of the chest to further assess.
