 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs, with most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Spinal hardware device is seen in the mid and lower thoracic spine.
 OGT is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the
 distal end is off the radiographic review.  Endotracheal tube ends
 approximately 5 cm above the carina and is adequate.  Since ___,
 the collapsed right lung has re-expanded.  Mild-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion and lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.  Small left pleural effusion
 and lower lung atelectasis is similar.  Cardiomediastinal contour is within
 normal limits and unchanged since prior radiograph from ___ and
 ___.  Opacity in the right apical region is probably due to a
 small right apical fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___ right lung has re-expanded with
 mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion and associated right lower lung
 atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion and left lower lung atelectasis is
 unchanged.
