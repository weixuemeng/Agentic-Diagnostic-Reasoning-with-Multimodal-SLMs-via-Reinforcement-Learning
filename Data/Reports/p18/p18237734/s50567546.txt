                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated.  Spinal hardware devices are seen in mid and lower
 thoracic spine.  Apparent shift in the mediastinal silhouette due to patient
 rotation resulting in increased density in the left lower mid thorax.  Course
 of the endotracheal tube in its lower course could not be found.  Endotracheal
 tube ends ___.5 cm above the carina ending at the level of the clavicles. 
 Consider advancing the ET tube by around 3 cm for better seating.  Left
 internal jugular line ends at mid SVC approximately.  Bilateral lung volumes
 remain low.  Mild-to-moderate right and minimal left pleural effusion
 associated with bilateral lower lung atelectasis is overall unchanged. 
 Evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is however limited due to the
 rotation of the patient.
