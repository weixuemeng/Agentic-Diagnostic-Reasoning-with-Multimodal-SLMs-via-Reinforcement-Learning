                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post C6-T11 extension of posterior fusion
 from C5-C6 anterior discectomy and fusion.
 
 STUDY:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube sits 5 cm above the carina.  An endogastric
 tube courses inferiorly towards the stomach.  Clips project over the left
 hemi-abdomen.  There has been interval extension of the previously described
 thoracic fusion hardware.  The heart size is stable given positioning and
 technique.  The right mediastinal contours are exaggerated by patient's
 rotation to the right.  The lung volumes are low with a small-to-moderate
 right pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.  Retrocardiac atelectasis
 is also seen.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  There is no
 large pneumothorax.
