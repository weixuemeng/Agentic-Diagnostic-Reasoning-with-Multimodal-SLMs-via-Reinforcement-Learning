                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left lateral chest wall pain status post fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky and linear opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Lung volumes are low.  Multiple
 calcified nodules in the right mid and upper lung fields likely reflect
 granulomas.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
