 The study is somewhat limited due to the patient's thoracolumbar scoliosis as
 well as the chin projecting over the lung apices.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There is a left-sided pleural effusion
 and a left retrocardiac opacity.  There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema
 or pneumothoraces.
