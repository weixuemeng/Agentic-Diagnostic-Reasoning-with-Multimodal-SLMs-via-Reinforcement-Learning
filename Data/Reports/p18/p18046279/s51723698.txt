                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pre-operative evaluation of the chest prior to right hip fracture
 repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted.  The trachea
 is midline.  The imaged upper abdomen demonstrates a nephroureteral stent in
 the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
