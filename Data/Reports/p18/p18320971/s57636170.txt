                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is difficult to assess given the obscuration of right heart border
 by moderate-to-large pleural effusion, also continuing towards the major
 fissure.  The right perihilar mass is obscured by effusion on the examination.
 Overall, no substantial change as compared to prior examinations has been
 demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.
