                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a history of gastric cancer and bacteremia
 after PICC line placement.  Now coughing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous consolidation has cleared mild pulmonary edema and upper lobe
 vascular distention indicative of cardiac dysfunction persist, small bilateral
 pleural effusions remain and the cardiac silhouette got appreciably larger
 between ___ and ___.  If this is indeed rapid cardiac
 dilatation, it suggests either viral or post-infarction cardiomyopathy. 
 Alternatively, it could be a pericardial effusion.  There are no radiographic
 findings to suggest tamponade despite the rapid evolution.  A right PIC line
 ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Dr. ___ ___ I discussed
 these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
