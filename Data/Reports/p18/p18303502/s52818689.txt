 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:13 PM
  Interval development of severe bilateral pulmonary opacities and peribronchial
  cuffing, which most likely represents edema; differential diagnosis includes
  ARDS.  Follow-up chest radiograph after diuresis may be helpful for
  differentiation.  Increased right pleural effusion.  Findings and
  recommendations discussed with ___ by ___ by
  telephone at 19:09 on ___ at the time of discovery of these
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread areas of consolidation are present, and previously only
 involved the lower lobes.  Considering rapid progression, co-existent septal
 lines in the lower lobes, and accompanying widening of the vascular pedicle,
 these findings could reflect rapidly progressive pulmonary edema from
 clinically suspected volume overload.  Massive aspiration could produce a
 similar appearance of rapidly progressive airspace disease.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
