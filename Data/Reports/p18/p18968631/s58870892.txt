                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chf, pna, on heparin awaiting cabg  // eval
 for interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ 08:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung bases are better depicted on the current study, compared to the prior.
 
 Allowing for this, the overall appearance is similar.  Again seen is patchy
 opacity at the right lung base, probably with a small right effusion, and
 increased retrocardiac density with a small left effusion.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning and field-of-view, the appearance at
 the right base may be slightly improved.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is background
 hyperinflation, cardiomegaly, and upper zone redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible slight improvement at the right base, though direct comparison is
 limited by the fact that the lung bases were not entirely included on the
 prior study.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
