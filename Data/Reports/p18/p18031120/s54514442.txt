                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with accidental partial PICC removal  // Eval PICC
 line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  A
 right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  A left chest wall pacer
 defibrillator with single lead is in unchanged position.  The right internal
 jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  The heart is enlarged which may
 reflect cardiomegaly, less likely pericardial effusion.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Increased opacity at the base of the
 right lung may reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  There is mild prominence of the vasculature likely
 reflective of a fluid replete state.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Subtle opacity at the right base may
 represent subsegmental atelectasis.Clinical correlation advised.
