  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Interval placement of a left internal jugular Cordis
  without pneumothorax.  Exact location difficult to delineate, its tip which
  projects somewhat more inferiorly than expected location of brachiocephalic. 
  Clinical correlation with blood gas to ensure venous placement or
  alternatively lateral may be helpful for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p left IJ cordis placement  // eval IJ placement,
 for pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at approximately 11:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright AP chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged heart.  A left
 chest pacer defibrillator device is present, its leads which appear intact in
 the in stable configuration relative to prior examination.  There has been
 interval placement of a left internal jugular Cordis, its tip which projects
 more inferiorly than the expected location of the brachiocephalic vein.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  A right PICC terminates within the low superior vena
 cava.  There is no large pleural effusion.  Central vascular engorgement is
 mild.  No focal consolidation is identified convincing for pneumonia given low
 lung volumes, portable technique and patient body habitus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  Interval placement of a left internal jugular Cordis
 without pneumothorax.  Exact location difficult to delineate, its tip which
 projects somewhat more inferiorly than expected location of brachiocephalic. 
 Clinical correlation with blood gas to ensure venous placement or
 alternatively lateral may be helpful for further evaluation.
