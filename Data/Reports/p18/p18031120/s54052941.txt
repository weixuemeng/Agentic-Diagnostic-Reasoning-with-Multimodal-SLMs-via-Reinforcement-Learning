                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, unknown
 arrhythmia status post ICD placement, here with a several day history of
 dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left upper chest pacer device with single associated right ventricular lead
 is seen in appropriate position. There is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette which is compatible with at least moderate cardiomegaly. Centrally
 predominant diffuse interstitial prominence is likely reflective of mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no frank pulmonary edema.  Lateral
 radiographic view is significantly limited by underpenetration, likely
 secondary to body habitus. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly. Centrally predominant diffuse interstitial prominence,
 compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary
 edema.
