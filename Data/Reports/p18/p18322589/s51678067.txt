 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:50 PM
  1. ET tube 4-4.5 cm above carina.
  2. endogastric tube tip in stomach, although side port is obscured by
  overlying cardiac leads and may be at/above GE junction - consider advancing.
  3. pacer/defib leads, prosthetic valve, and sternotomy wires stable.
  4. RIJ central line tip in mid-to-low SVC - no pneumothorax or apical cap.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Central venous line placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior radiograph there was interval insertion of right internal
 jugular line with its tip terminating in the level of cavoatrial junction. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or apical hematoma.  The ET tube tip is
 4.3 cm above the carina.  The replaced mitral valve and the pacemaker leads
 are in unchanged position.  Overall there is no change in widespread
 parenchymal opacities, bibasal atelectasis and pleural effusion.
