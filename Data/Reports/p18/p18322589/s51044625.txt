                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and renal failure.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 as well as chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The pacer unit leads are unchanged in position.  The endotracheal
 tube tip sits 3 cm above the carina.  The endogastric tube side port sits just
 below the GE junction.  A prosthetic mitral valve is noted.
 
 The heart size is stable.  There has been minimal improvement in the diffuse
 ground-glass opacities.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggests small
 pleural effusions along with predominantly retrocardiac atelectasis.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved pulmonary opacities compatible with moderate
 pulmonary edema versus pulmonary hemorrhage.
