 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits 4 cm above the carina.  A
 right-sided central venous catheter tip sits at the cavoatrial junction.  An
 endogastric tube courses inferiorly below the GE junction.  A pacer
 defibrillator unit projects over the left chest with leads in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Sternotomy wires, prosthetic
 valve, and CABG material are unchanged.  The heart size is at the upper limits
 of normal.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 demonstrate stable appearance of interstitial edema, and small bilateral
 pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
