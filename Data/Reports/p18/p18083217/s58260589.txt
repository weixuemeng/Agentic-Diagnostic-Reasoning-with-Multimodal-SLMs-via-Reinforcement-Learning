                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, difficulty breathing, chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded, as seen
 previously.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
