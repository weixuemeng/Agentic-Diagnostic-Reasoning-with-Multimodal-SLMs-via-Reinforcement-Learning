 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, tachypnic  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. Bibasilar streaky
 opacities are again seen which may represent scarring/atelectasis. Difficult
 to exclude a component of aspiration/ pneumonia. A tiny right effusion is
 likely present. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax. No
 convincing signs of edema. Severe degenerative disease at bilateral shoulders
 again noted. There is a mild dextroscoliosis centered in the lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely due to a combination of atelectasis, scarring,
 difficult to exclude a component of aspiration/pneumonia.
