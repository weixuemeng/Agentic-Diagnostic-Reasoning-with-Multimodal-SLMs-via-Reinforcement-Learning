                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Ap chest radiograph
 
 The NG tube tip terminates at the proximal location, most likely at the
 gastroesophageal junction with the sidehole being in the distal esophagus and
 should be advanced.  Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low
 SVC.  Right lower lung opacity concerning for a combination of atelectasis,
 pleural effusion and potentially infectious process is unchanged and might
 also reflect central obstruction.  Further assessment with chest CT is
 recommended.
 
 Left basal opacity is noted, new as compared to prior study and might reflect
 developing infectious process at the left lower lung.
