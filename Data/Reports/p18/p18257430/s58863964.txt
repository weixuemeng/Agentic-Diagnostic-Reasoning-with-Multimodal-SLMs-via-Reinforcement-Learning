                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes is redemonstrated. The
 aerated right upper lobe shows no focal opacities. No focal opacities are seen
 in the left lung. Coarse interstitial opacities in the left lower lobe is
 compatible with minimal fibrosis, unchanged from multiple priors.  Small
 right-sided pleural effusion is also stable. There is no left-sided effusion.
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.
 
 Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders is present, with high riding
 humeral heads and obliteration of the acromiohumeral intervals bilaterally
 compatible with rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged chronic collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, mild
 right-sided pleural effusion and minimal fibrosis of the left lower lobe.
 
 2.  Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders with signs of rotator cuff
 disease.
