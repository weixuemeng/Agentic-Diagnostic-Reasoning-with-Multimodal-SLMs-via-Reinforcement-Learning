                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.
 
 STUDY:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a mildly tortuous aorta.  The lung volumes are low, exaggerating
 parenchymal markings.  Additionally, an ill-defined rounded right base opacity
 is present, and on lateral view likely localizes to the right lower lobe. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia. Recommend
 follow-up to resolution.
