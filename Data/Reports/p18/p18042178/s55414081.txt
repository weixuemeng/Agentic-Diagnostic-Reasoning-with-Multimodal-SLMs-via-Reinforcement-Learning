                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusions, fever  // ?enlarged
 pleural effusions or new pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___, and CT
 of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. The region of opacification of the
 left upper and lower lobes, corresponding to pleural effusion and atelectasis
 seen on CT from ___, has decreased in size over the interval. There
 are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered. Multiple overlying surgical
 clips and intact sternotomy wires are seen. Calcification of the both
 diaphragmatic pleura is unchanged and consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the degree of opacification of the left upper and
 lower lobes, corresponding to pleural effusion and atelectasis from CT dated ___.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
