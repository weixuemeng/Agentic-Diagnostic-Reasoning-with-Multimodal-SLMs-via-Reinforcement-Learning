 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged, with overlying surgical clips and intact sternotomy
 wires.  In the left upper and lower lobes, there is an opacity with an unusual
 configuration, corresponding with the pleural effusion seen on the CT from the
 same date, and suggesting possible loculation. There is calcification of the
 right basal pleura. There may be right-sided pleural effusion as well, however
 correlation with a CT chest is done for confirmation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper and lower lobe opacity, corresponding with the pleural effusion
 seen on the CT from the same date.  The unusual configuration of this opacity
 suggests possible loculation.
