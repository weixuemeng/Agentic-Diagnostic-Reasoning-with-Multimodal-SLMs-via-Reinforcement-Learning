 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L PICC repo. L PICC pulled back 3cm.
 Evaluate line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date, ___,

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left subclavian PICC line tip has been retracted to the cavoatrial
 junction.  Compared with the radiograph from earlier on the same date, the
 left pleural effusion has slightly increased, with improvement in right lung
 aeration. Alveolar opacities in the left lung suggest continued pulmonary
 edema. Unchanged median sternotomy wires, mediastinal surgical clips, and
 pleural calcifications, consistent with asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left subclavian PICC line tip now at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 2. Slight interval increase in the left pleural effusion, with continued
 pulmonary edema.
