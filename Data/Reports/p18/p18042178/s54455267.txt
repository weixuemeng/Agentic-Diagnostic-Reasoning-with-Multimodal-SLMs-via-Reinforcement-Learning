                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever 103, tachycardic, unable to go off
 telemetry  // Eval for pna, new evidence of aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___, left PICC has been removed. Stable cardiomegaly
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion.  Diffuse pleural calcifications
 are again demonstrated consistent with previous asbestos exposure.  Bilateral
 pleural thickening and or pleural effusions are again demonstrated.  No
 definite superimposed pneumonia or aspiration, but the diffuse subpleural
 abnormalities limits assessment of the underlying lung parenchyma,
 particularly in the left upper hemi thorax. Consider a PA and lateral chest
 radiograph for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
