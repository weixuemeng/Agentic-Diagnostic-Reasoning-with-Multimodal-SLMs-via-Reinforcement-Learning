                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man presenting s/p mechanical fall with multiple
 inoperatble fractures, RP bleed, now with pna, UTI, pleural effusions  //
 pleural effusion eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with CABG. There is an unchanged
 fracture through the fourth sternotomy wire from the top.  The bones are
 diffusely osteopenic. Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
 There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral airspace opacities most likely due to
 pulmonary edema are unchanged.  Bilateral pleural plaques are again noted. The
 left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the field of view, thereby
 limiting assessment of the known left pleural effusion. The small right
 pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. The left subclavian PICC line is
 unchanged, terminating at the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Bilateral pleural plaques.
