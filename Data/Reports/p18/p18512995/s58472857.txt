                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with VATS  // pneumo      pneumo
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 17 34
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right chest tube remains in place and there is now a visible small right
 apical lateral pneumothorax. Stable postoperative changes are seen in the
 right lower lung. Interval development of a patchy opacity at the left base
 could reflect an area of atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia
 should also be considered. Followup imaging to assess for resolution of this
 finding would be recommended.  There are likely small bilateral effusions.
 Overall cardiac and  mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
