 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with wedge resection s/p chest tube removal  //

 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 09:47.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the right chest tube with a stable small right apical
 lateral pneumothorax. Small amount of air within the right lateral chest wall
 soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema likely related to recent
 chest tube removal. Left basilar patchy opacity is stable which may reflect
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.
 Stable postoperative changes are seen in the right lower lung. There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  No large effusions are appreciated.
