                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with left internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.4 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip appears to course below the left diaphragm, off the inferior
 borders of the film.  A left internal jugular vascular sheath is kinked within
 the level of the neck, and tip is within the region of the low internal
 jugular vein.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The lung volumes
 remain low.  Widening of the mediastinum is unchanged, and may reflect low
 lung volumes with supine AP positioning.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Atelectasis is
 seen in the left lung base.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected on this supine study. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes appear to be in standard positions.
 2. Left internal jugular vascular sheath is kinked at the level of the neck,
 and tip is within the low left internal jugular vein.
 3. Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
 4. Unchanged widening of the superior mediastinum which may be due to low lung
 volumes and technique.
