                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMH of HTN and SLE who presented in septic shock now s/p
 ex-lap and sigmoid colectomy.  // intubated, interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, bilateral perihilar airspace
 opacities have rapidly shifted in distribution, and are now more severe on the
 right than the left.  Such rapid changes favor pulmonary edema over infectious
 pneumonia.  Moderate right pleural effusion appears increased, but positional
 differences between the exams limit comparison.  No other relevant changes.
