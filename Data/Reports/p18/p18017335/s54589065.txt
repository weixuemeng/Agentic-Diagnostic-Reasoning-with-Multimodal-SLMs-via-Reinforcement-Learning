                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMH of HTN and SLE who presented in septic shock now s/p
 ex-lap and sigmoid colectomy.  // intubated interval change     intubated
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest radiograph ___ at 04:56 is submitted.  Left
 costophrenic angle is not entirely included.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Fluctuating bilateral perihilar airspace opacities consistent with worsening
 pulmonary edema rather than infection.  Stably widened cardiac and mediastinal
 contours likely related to differences in patient positioning. Left subclavian
 central line unchanged in position.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its
 tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is only seen to
 the level of the distal esophagus, possibly related to underpenetration,
 although clinical correlation is recommended to ensure that it has not pulled
 back.
