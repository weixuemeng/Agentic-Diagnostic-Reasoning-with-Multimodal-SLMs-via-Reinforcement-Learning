                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough x5 days, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest show bibasilar reticular
 opacities which are new from ___.  This may represent worsening chronic
 changes.  A process such as volume overload or infection cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Diaphragms are flattened consistent with obstructive lung disease. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  There are degenerative changes seen within the thoracic spine.  An
 age-indeterminate wedge compression fracture is seen at T7 that was present on
 prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar reticular opacities likely represents progression of
 chronic disease and severe emphysema.
