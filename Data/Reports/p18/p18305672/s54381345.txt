                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Hazy
 opacification in the lower lung zones could well reflect merely scattered
 radiation related to the size of the patient.  However, the costophrenic
 angles are not well seen posteriorly, suggesting some pleural effusion.  No
 substantial vascular congestion.
