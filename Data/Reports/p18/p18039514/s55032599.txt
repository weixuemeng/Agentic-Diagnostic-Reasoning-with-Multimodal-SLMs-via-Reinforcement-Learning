  Minimally increased left basilar opacity - may be due to increasing left
  pleural effusion with increased atelectasis.  However, given recent vomiting -
  aspiration also possible. Consider PA/Lateral for further assessment

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastric adenocarcinoma, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly developed
 subtle pleural opacity at the left lung base, obliterating the left
 costophrenic sinus.  The change could be caused by a small pleural effusion. 
 The morphology of the change is not typical for pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 Mild deviation of the trachea to the right, potentially caused by a small
 retrosternal goiter.
 
 No acute lung changes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.
