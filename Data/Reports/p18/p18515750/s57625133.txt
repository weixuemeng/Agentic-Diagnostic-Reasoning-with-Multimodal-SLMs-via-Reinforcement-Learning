                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and left internal jugular line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ approximately 2 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP view through the chest demonstrates cardiomegaly.
 Cephalization of vasculature, as well as diffuse patchy opacities,
 particularly to lateral to the right hilum, is reflective of mild pulmonary
 edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. A
 radiopaque tubular structure is identified projecting over the left neck soft
 tissues.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Diffuse airspace opacities thought secondary to pulmonary
 edema. Recommend follow examination to exclude developing pneumonia.
