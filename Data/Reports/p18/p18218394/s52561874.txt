                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Minimal right basilar patchy opacity likely reflects atelectasis,
 and blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears chronic, likely due to
 either a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening/scarring.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No interval change from the prior exam without acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
