                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with aortic stenosis, COPD, and diastolic CHF,
 presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest from outside hospital of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size.  Heterogeneous opacity overlying the right hilar and
 juxtahilar regions are slightly improved since ___.  A small left
 pleural effusion is present adjacent to small left base atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.  A superimposed pattern of nodularity appears to correspond to
 bilateral costochondral calcifications.  Severe dysmorphic changes of the
 glenohumeral joints are similar to ___ with erosion of the humeral
 head into the glenoid fossa and distal clavicle.  Wedging of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is better seen on ___ CT.  IVC filter is incompletely
 imaged.  Wires of a left chest wall pacer terminate over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 1.  Right mid and upper lung juxtahilar heterogeneous opacities, which appear
 slightly improved since ___, could represent infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 3.  No overt pulmonary edema as queried.
 4.  Severe dysmorphic/degenerative changes of the shoulders.
