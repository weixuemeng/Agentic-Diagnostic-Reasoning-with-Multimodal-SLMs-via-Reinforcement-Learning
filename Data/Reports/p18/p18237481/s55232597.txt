                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, fever and decreased breath sounds,
 rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart is normal
 in size and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  On the frontal view
 projecting over the left anterior sixth and seventh rib interspaces are more
 small opacities than can be attributed to the left nipple.  This conforms to
 opacity on the lateral view overlying the lowest partially visible thoracic
 vertebral body, probably pneumonia.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable, small left lower lobe pneumonia.  Suggest repeat CXR in
 4 weeks to document clearing, sooner if indicated by clinical status.  
 
 ED Nurses notified by tracked email of change from initial reading.
