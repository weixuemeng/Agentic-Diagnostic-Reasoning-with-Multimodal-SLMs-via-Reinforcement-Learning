                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right lower quadrant pain, but with transient
 radiation to chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is slightly limited by patient rotation. Heart size is
 within normal size limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic knob. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam. Patchy opacities within
 the lung bases, more so on the left, may reflect areas of atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be completely excluded in the left lung base.  There may be a
 trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Biapical
 pleural thickening and calcification are unchanged. The osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so on the left, may reflect areas of
 atelectasis but infection is difficult to exclude in the left lung base. 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.
