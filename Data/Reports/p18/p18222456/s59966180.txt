 rising leukocytosis; evaluate for lung infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New bilateral pleural effusions since ___, moderate on the right and
 mild-to-moderate on the left.  Hazy adjacent opacities in the bilateral lower
 lungs may be from layering effusions, but could also result from a focal
 consolidation, which is unclear on this frontal view. Interval increase in the
 heart size of the heart, with new cardiomegaly. New rightward convex bulging
 of the mediastinum, likely from and engorged SVC. Mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  New scattered bilateral patchy opacities in the lower lungs is
 most likely from mild interstitial edema, but pneumonia cannot be excluded. No
 pneumothorax. Stable biapical pleural thickening since at least ___.
 Stable dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New probable mild-to-moderate volume overload or heart failure, although a
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Recommend conventional PA chest
 radiograph for further evaluation of the lower lung opacities if the patient
 can tolerate it.
