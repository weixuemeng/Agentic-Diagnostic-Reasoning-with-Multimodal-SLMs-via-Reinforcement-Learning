                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs, on fluids for
 hypercalcemia.  Worsening O2 saturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  As compared to the prior examination, lung volumes
 are decreased.  There is crowding of previously seen bilateral nodular
 opacities due to decreased lung volumes, however there is likely superimposed
 fluid overload.  There may be minimal increase in cardiac size however the
 majority of the apparent increase is due to differences in technique.
