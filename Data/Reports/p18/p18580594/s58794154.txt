                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable.  Widespread pulmonary metastases are again
 demonstrated, with a dominant 3.3-cm diameter peripheral mass in the lingula. 
 On the lateral view, increasing confluent opacity is seen overlying the lower
 thoracic spine as compared to the lateral chest radiograph of ___,
 with associated partial obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.  Small right
 pleural effusion is present, similar to ___ radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Widespread pulmonary metastases.
 2.  Dependent consolidation overlying the lower thoracic spine on lateral
 chest x-ray, which could be due to an infectious pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 3.  Small pleural effusions.
