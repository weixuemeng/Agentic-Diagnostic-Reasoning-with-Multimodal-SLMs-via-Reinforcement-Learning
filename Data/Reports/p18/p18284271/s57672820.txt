  Low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
  
  2.4 x 1.5 cm proximal right humerus chondroid lesion which most likely
  represents an enchondroma, but is not fully assessed on this study.  If this
  has not been further evaluated previously, recommend dedicated right shoulder
  or humerus views.

 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy.  Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is
 seen with leads extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Projecting over the right humeral
 head and neck, is a 2.4 x 1.5 cm well-defined chondroid lesion which may
 represent enchondroma, but is not fully assessed on this study.  If this has
 not been further evaluated previously, recommend dedicated right shoulder or
 humerus views.
