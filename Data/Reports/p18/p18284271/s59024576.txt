                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with RIJ CVL  // central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph with the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter, which
 terminates in the low SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the
 examination is essentially unchanged with bibasilar opacities, either
 reflecting atelectasis or underlying aspiration/pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter terminating in the
 low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
 2. Stable bibasilar opacities, either atelectasis or underlying
 aspiration/pneumonia.
