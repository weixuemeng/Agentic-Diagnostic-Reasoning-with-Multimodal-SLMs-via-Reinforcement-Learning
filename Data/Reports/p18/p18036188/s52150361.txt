 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post left-sided decortication,

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in

 study obtained on ___.
 
 Similar as on the preceding examination, a large-bore chest tube terminates in

 clearly identifies an apical pneumothorax which is up to 2 and 3 cm wide.  A
 wide caliber, probably hemodialysis line is placed via the right internal
 jugular approach appears in unchanged position.  It is overlying the apical
 pneumothorax, but is unlikely to be the cause of the condition.  A left-sided
 internal jugular approach central venous line reaches into the right
 mediastinum as before and is in unchanged position.
