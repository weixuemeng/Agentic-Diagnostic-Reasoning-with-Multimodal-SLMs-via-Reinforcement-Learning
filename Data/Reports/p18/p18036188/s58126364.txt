 HISTORY:  Volume resuscitation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  Substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 There has been the sudden development of increased opacification in the left
 upper zone.  The configuration suggests that this represents something
 external to the patient.  A repeat study would be recommended.
