 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY 
 
 INDICATION:  MVR, CABG.  Evaluation for Shiley placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Swan-Ganz ends in the right pulmonary artery. There is a right

 The distal end of the ET tube is either too high or hidden by the NG tube.
 Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  There is bilateral overlying
 pleural effusion which is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The distal end of the ET tube is either hidden by the NG tube or possibly
 too high, suggest repeating the chest x-ray.
 
 2.  The remaining of tubes and lines are in adequate position.
