  Unchanged persistent tiny left apical and basal pneumothorax.  Right apex is
  difficult to evaluate due to overlying wires however tiny right apical
  pneumothorax is likely unchanged.  Otherwise no change from earlier study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post left decortication and right chest tube placement,
 evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 persisting left tiny apical and basal pneumothorax.  The right apex is
 difficult to evaluate due to overlying wires, however, there also is likely
 presence of a minimal right apical pneumothorax.  No evidence of tension.  The
 position of the chest tubes and other monitoring and support devices is
 constant.  No changes in appearance of the lung parenchyma and the cardiac
 silhouette.
