                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal on left, now right chest tube clamped.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there appears to be a continued
 small and perhaps decreasing left pneumothorax.  With the right chest tube
 clamped, there is no evidence of appreciable right pneumothorax.  Left basilar
 opacification consistent with effusion and volume loss persists.
