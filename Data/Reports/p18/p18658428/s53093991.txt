                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right -sided chest pain and right radicular
 symptoms  // r/o right sided chest lesion      r/o right sided chest lesion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  The right-sided ribs and
 the soft tissues of the chest wall appear unremarkable.  A known calcified 1
 cm left apical nodule is visualized.  On the lordotic view, the nodule
 projects over the first rib and the lateral parts of the sternum. 
 Nonetheless, the nodule should be further worked up with CT, given the absence
 of previous comparisons.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT is recommended to workup a 1 cm left apical lung
 nodule.  The recommendation was added to the radiology dashboard.
