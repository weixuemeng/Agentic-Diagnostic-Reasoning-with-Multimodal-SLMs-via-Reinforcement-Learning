                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left apical pneumothorax is unchanged with no evidence of
 tension.  A loculated retrosternal collection with an air-fluid level is
 noted, which was not clearly seen on prior exams as they were done portably,
 not fully upright and with no lateral view.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Bilateral trace pleural effusions are present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No change in left apical pneumothorax with no evidence of tension.
 2.  Retrosternal loculated collection with an air-fluid level, not clearly
 seen on prior radiographs relating to lack of lateral view and not being in
 the upright position.
