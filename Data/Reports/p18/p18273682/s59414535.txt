                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent CABG and closure of patent foramen
 ovale in need of interval assessment.
 
 STUDY:  AP portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the endotracheal and endogastric
 tubes.  The right IJ central venous line tip still sits at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Chest drains are unchanged.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged given the slightly lower lung volumes.  There may be trace left
 pleural effusion but no large pneumothorax.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis
 is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal and endogastric tube removal without
 evidence of complication or other change.
