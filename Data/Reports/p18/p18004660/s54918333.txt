                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with confusion, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 normal in size, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Lungs are
 symmetrically expanded without focal consolidation.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear opacities at the right base are less
 conspicuous compared to the prior examination and likely reflect atelectasis.
 Hardware noted in the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia. Perihilar prominence suggests mild
 congestion.
