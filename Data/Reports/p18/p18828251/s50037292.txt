                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable with aortic knob calcifications visualized. 
 There is consolidative opacity within the right lung, most pronounced within
 the right upper lobe.  Additionally, ill-defined hazy opacity is noted within
 the left perihilar region.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 visualized.  Mild degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Consolidative opacity within the right upper lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia.
 2.  Hazy opacity within the right lung base as well as within the left
 perihilar region may reflect superimposed pulmonary edema, though infection
 within the right lung base also is not excluded.
