                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with
 intact midline sternal wires after CABG.  No evidence of vascular congestion. 
 The overall discordancy raises possibility of cardiomyopathy.  Calcification
 is again seen in coronary vessels.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
