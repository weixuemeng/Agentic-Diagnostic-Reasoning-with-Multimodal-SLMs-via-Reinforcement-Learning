 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure and status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates near
 the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm above the carina.  The balloon is not
 well seen.  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are probably within normal range.  The lungs
 appear clear.  The extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, but
 there is no evidence for pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Somewhat high-lying endotracheal tube, about 6 cm above the
 carina.  If clinically indicated, advancing the tube slightly could be
 considered for more optimal positioning; the balloon is also not well seen and
 could accordingly be deflated potentially.
