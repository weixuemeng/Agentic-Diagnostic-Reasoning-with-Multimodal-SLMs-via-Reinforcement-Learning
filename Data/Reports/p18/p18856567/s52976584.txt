                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:58 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with an aspiration risk and cough.  Possible
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened and small right pleural effusion has
 developed.  Upper lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary edema or
 consolidation there.  Heart is largely obscured by elevated hemidiaphragm but
 probably enlarged.  Gaseous distention of bowel loops in the left upper
 quadrant has worsened appreciably, probably contributing to diminished
 excursion of the left hemidiaphragm.
