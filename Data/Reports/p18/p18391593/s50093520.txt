                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Desaturation with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued evidence of
 the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with dilated gas-filled loops of bowel
 consistent with a dynamic ileus or possible obstruction.  Atelectatic changes
 are seen at the right base.  However, the heart remains within normal limits
 in size and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
