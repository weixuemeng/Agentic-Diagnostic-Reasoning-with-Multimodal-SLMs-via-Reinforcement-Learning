                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Bilateral pulmonary opacifications
 persist, though they may be slightly less on the left.  Again, there is
 probably some mild elevated pulmonary venous pressure with bilateral pleural
 effusions and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Once again, superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
