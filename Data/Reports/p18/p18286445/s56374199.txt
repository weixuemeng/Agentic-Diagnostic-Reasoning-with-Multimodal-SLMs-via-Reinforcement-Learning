                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Vague opacity is
 noted at the left lung base obscuring the left heart border which could
 represent pneumonia.  There is also opacity obscuring the right heart border
 which could represent a fat pad or pneumonia.  No large pleural effusions are
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No gross signs for pulmonary edema.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacities obscuring the right and left heart border which
 could represent pneumonia, although the possibility of epicardial fat pad is
 also raised.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Consider dedicated PA and
 lateral views for a more complete assessment.
