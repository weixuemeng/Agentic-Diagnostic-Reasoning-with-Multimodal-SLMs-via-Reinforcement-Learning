                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CP  // evidence of pneumonia orp neumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. In this setting, slightly increased
 opacification of the left lung base most likely reflects atelectasis. There is
 mild interstitial pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No
 convincing evidence of pneumonia. A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the
 proximal right atrium. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
