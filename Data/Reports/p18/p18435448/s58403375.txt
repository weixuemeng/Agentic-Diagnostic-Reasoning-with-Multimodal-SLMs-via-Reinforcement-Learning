                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Severe epigastric pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia and free
 air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are extremely low,
 which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Bilateral lower lobe
 opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely normal. No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly low lung volumes.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities most
 likely represent atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded.  No free
 intraperitoneal air.
