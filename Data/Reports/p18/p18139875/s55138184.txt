                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCM, heart block, status post dual-chamber PPM, check lead position
 and rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Compared with the prior study, left-sided dual-lead pacemaker has been placed,
 with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 Again seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly with mildly tortuous unfolded
 aorta.  The hila are both prominent with a tapered appearance, raising the
 question of pulmonary hypertension.  There is minimal upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  There is minimal atelectasis
 at the left lung base.  No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. 
 Probable osteopenia and mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are
 noted.
