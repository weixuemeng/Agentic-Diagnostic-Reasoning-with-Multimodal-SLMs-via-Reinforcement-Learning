                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent acute respiratory failure from alveolar hemorrhage.  Evaluate
 interstitial process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated and a enteric tube has been removed
 in the interim.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the upper to mid SVC.
 
 There has been near resolution of the bilateral ground-glass opacities with
 some residual opacities seen within the right mid lung and lung bases.  A new
 and more focal consolidation is noted within the right lower lobe.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near resolution of bilateral ground-glass opacities, which likely represented
 pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 New, more focal consolidation in the right lower lobe posteriorly, which could
 reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
