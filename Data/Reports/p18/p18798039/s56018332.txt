                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with large amount of subcutaneous gas.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest of ___, chest radiograph of ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable supine view of the chest demonstrates extensive amount of
 subcutaneous gas.  Pneumomediastinum persists.  Previously noted left 
 pneumothorax is not apparent on this exam.  Moderate right pleural effusion
 persists.  Right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.  Right PIC
 catheter tip projects over mid SVC.  ET tube is in place, its tip terminating
 1.8 cm from the carina.  Right lung base consolidation persists.  Diffuse
 bilateral airspace opacities are largely unchanged since study obtained one
 hour prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable appearance of extensive subcutaneous gas, which slightly limits
 evaluation for a pneumothorax. Previously noted left pneumothorax is not
 evident on this exam. 
 
 2.  Diffuse airspace opacities, right greater than the left, may represent
 asymmetric edema, aspiration or infection.
