                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, with new nasogastric tube placement.  Assess for
 NGT position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph earlier on the day.  
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an interval placement of the
 nasogastric tube with the tip terminating in the expected location of the
 gastric antrum.  The right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.  
 
 The low lung volumes are low.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded in
 this study.  There is interval increased of veil-like opacity in the right
 hemithorax, likely representing layering of enlarging moderate right-sided
 pleural effusion.  The left lung remains clear.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, with the tip terminating in the
 expected location of the gastric antrum.
 2.  Veil-like opacity in the right hemithorax, likely representing layering of
 a moderate  right-sided pleural effusion.  Adjacent right lower lobe
 atelectasis and/or consolidation.
