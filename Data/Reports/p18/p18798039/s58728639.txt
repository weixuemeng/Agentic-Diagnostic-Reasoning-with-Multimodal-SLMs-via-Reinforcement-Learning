                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been apparent slight decrease in width of
 cardiomediastinal contours, possibly due to improved volume status of the
 patient.  A moderate-sized right pleural effusion is present with adjacent
 right lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.  Left lung is grossly clear and
 there is no evidence of a left pleural effusion.
