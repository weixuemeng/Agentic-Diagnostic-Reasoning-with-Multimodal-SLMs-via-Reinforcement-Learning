                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pigtail pleural catheter has been re-positioned, with the tip
 now terminating overlying the eighth right posterior rib lateral to the right
 hilum.  Moderate to large layering right pleural effusion is present.  This is
 slightly increased in size since the prior radiograph.  Widespread
 subcutaneous emphysema and diffuse pneumomediastinum are present.  Extensive
 emphysema limits sensitivity for pneumothorax.  Interval apparent widening of
 cardiomediastinal contours may reflect vascular distention from increased
 volume status.  Worsening diffuse right lung opacities are of uncertain
 etiology but could reflect asymmetrical edema, massive aspiration, or a
 developing infectious pneumonia.  Within the left lung, interstitial edema is
 present as well as a small left pleural effusion.
