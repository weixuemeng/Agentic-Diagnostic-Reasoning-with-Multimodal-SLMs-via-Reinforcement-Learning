 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Vasculitis, recent pulmonary hemorrhage, right lower lobe
 opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right lower
 lobe opacity has decreased in extent and severity.  This decrease is more
 obvious on the frontal than on the lateral radiograph.  The lateral radiograph
 continues to show the right lower lobe opacity with volume loss, projecting
 over the dorsal parts of the hemithorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 large.  There is no pleural effusion or no new parenchymal opacity.  Unchanged
 position of the right PICC line.
