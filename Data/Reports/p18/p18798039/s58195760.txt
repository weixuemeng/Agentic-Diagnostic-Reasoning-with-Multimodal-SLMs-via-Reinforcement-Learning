                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for left pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates extensive subcutaneous gas,
 which limits assessment for pneumothorax; however, no appreciable pneumothorax
 is seen.  Pneumomediastinum persists.  Moderate right pleural effusion is
 largely unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities have minimally
 progressed since prior.  There is no left pleural effusion.  ET tube is
 positioned 3.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen traversing the
 esophagus and terminating in the  stomach.  The right PIC catheter tip
 projects over mid SVC.  Right-sided chest tube is in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive subcutaneous gas limits evaluation for pneumothorax.  Within
 this limitation, no appreciable pneumothorax is detected.  Persistent
 pneumomediastinum and diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.
 
 2.  Moderate right pleural effusion, unchanged.
