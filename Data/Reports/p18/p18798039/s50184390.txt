                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Query aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a right PICC with tip terminating in the upper SVC. 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded with a vague opacity at
 the right lung base which may represent an evolving aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague right lower lobe opacity, which may represent aspiration in
 the correct clinical setting.
