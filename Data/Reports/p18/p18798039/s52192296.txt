 COMPARISON:  Prior CT chest from earlier today as well as a chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Coughing up blood, history of Wegener's, hemoptysis.

 grossly clear.  The heart appears within normal limits in size.  The
 mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion, right basal consolidation with air within
