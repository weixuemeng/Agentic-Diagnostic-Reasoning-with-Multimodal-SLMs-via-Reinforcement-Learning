                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Upright PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, likely exaggerated
 by the low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 lung volumes are low but clear of consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
