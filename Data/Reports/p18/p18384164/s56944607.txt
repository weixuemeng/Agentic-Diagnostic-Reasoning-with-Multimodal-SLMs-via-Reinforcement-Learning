                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rib defect after a fall.  Question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiographs there are new discontinuities involving
 the upper and lower most among three cerclage wires situated along lateral
 right lower ribs, which are also only completely visualized on the lateral
 view.  There is no gross change in alignment since the prior radiographs;
 however the ribs are difficult to visualize.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, as before.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is patchy unchanged opacification in the right lower lung suggesting
 scarring with no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight loss among
 vertebral body heights along the thoracic spine appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited views of the right ribs with discontinuities in cerclage
 wires that appear new since the most recent prior studies, although the acuity
 of this change is otherwise not possible to assess.
