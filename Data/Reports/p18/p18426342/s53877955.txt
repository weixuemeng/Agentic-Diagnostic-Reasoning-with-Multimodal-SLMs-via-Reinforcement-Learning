                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___ as well as older radiographs dating
 back to ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous wedge resection procedure in
 the right lung.  Multifocal bilateral areas of consolidation reported on the
 ___ chest radiograph have slightly improved, and continue to involve
 the left mid and both lower lung regions.  No new areas of consolidation are
 identified.  There may be small pleural effusions or slight pleural
 thickening.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in multifocal consolidation which may reflect
 response of pneumonia to interval therapy.  Additional followup chest
 radiograph in four weeks may be helpful to document complete resolution.
