                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ at 20:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube is noted coursing below the left hemidiaphragm and through the
 stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Metallic stents are
 demonstrated within the trachea and esophagus, as seen on the previous CT.
 Widening of the superior mediastinal contour corresponds to abnormal soft
 tissue density surrounding the proximal/ mid esophagus as seen on the previous
 CT. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with layering small to
 moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacities correspond to
 the areas of compressive atelectasis as seen on the previous CT. Cardiac
 silhouette size is not or enlarged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Tracheal and esophageal stents in unchanged positions. Widening of the
 superior mediastinal contour corresponds to abnormal soft tissue density about
 the proximal/mid esophagus.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small to moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
