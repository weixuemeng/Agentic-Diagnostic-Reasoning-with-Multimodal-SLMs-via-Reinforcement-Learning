                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MRSA bacteremia and temporary pacer  //
 Please obtain portable CXR in AM of ___ to evaluate for temporary pacer
 lead placement     Please obtain portable CXR in AM of ___ to evaluate for
 temporary pacer lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs septae since ___, most
 recently ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right pectoral generator and dressings obscure the midportion of the right
 lung.  There are no findings elsewhere in the right lung or left upper lung
 suspicious for pneumonia.  On the left cardiac silhouette and descending
 thoracic aorta obscure some of the left lower lobe.  Left diaphragmatic
 interface was previously sharp, no longer.  This is due to either small left
 pleural effusion or consolidation in the left lower lobe.  If feasible,
 conventional chest radiographs, particularly the lateral view would be helpful
 in evaluating this region.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has
 improved.  The transjugular right ventricular pacer lead is unchanged in
 position, continuous from the generator.
