                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob  // ?pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Left chest wall pacer device is
 unchanged in position with leads extending to the region of the right atrium
 and right ventricle as well as the coronary sinus.  The heart remains
 moderately enlarged.  Subtle opacity is seen within the left mid lung which
 could represent an early developing pneumonia.  Alternatively, asymmetric
 pulmonary edema is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  No large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are intact.  Subtle deformity of the right humeral neck likely
 reflect an old injury.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild congestion noted with subtle opacity in
 the left mid lung which could represent a developing pneumonia versus
 asymmetric edema.  Please correlate clinically.
