  A left pacemaker generator projects over the left lateral chest wall.  Leads
  are in unchanged position.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  An opacity
  projecting over the right lateral midlung consistent with the patient's known
  pleural based fluid collection is unchanged allowing for technical
  differences.  No additional focal pulmonary opacity is seen.  An apparent
  deformity of the right humerus is partially evaluated and appears unchanged
  from prior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MRSA bacteremia with CTA finding
 concerning for empyema  // Any change in size of consolidation?      Any
 change in size of consolidation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with dual-channel pacer in place.  Continued bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, with associated basilar
 atelectasis.  Little change in the opacification laterally in the mid right
 lung, which could represent an area of pneumonia.  If the condition of the
 patient permits, a lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation.
