                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall from Walker with left chest pain and right knee pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged given difference in technique
 with unchanged mediastinal contour.  There is slight prominence of the central
 pulmonary vasculature suggestive of fluid overload.  There is no frank
 interstitial edema.  A left-sided 3 lead pacer remains in unchanged position. 
 There is mild bibasilar atelectasis with some hazy peripheral opacity in the
 right lung field which may be related to check-in fluid from the small
 right-sided effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no distracted rib
 fracture although evaluation is difficult given technique.  A compression
 deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload, right-sided effusion and
 peripheral bibasilar opacities which are likely to represent atelectasis
 however infection cannot be excluded given the correct clinical circumstance. 
 No distracted rib fracture or pneumothorax although evaluation is limited
 given technique.
