 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Scapular pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Low lung volumes with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, but
 without evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No other
 parenchymal changes.  In case of scapular pain and suspected bony changes, a
 dedicated bone radiograph would be a diagnostic option.
