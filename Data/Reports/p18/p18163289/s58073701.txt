                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate after intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is located at the origin of the right mainstem bronchus. The
 tube could safely be withdrawn 2-3 cm. An enteric tube courses into the first
 portion of the duodenum. A VP shunt is partially imaged.
 
 Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible
 with mild pulmonary edema. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is a more focal
 opacity in the left lower lung, which may reflect infection or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. There is likely a small left pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube should be withdrawn 2-3 cm for positioning within the low trachea.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 3. More focal opacity in the left lower lung could reflect infection or
 asymmetric edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 5:12 AM, 1 minute after discovery of the findings.
