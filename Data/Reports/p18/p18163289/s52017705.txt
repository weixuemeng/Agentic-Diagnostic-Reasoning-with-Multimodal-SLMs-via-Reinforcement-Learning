                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF. Evaluate after extubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, including the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube and enteric tube have been
 removed. A left PICC is unchanged with the tip at the origin of the SVC.
 Allowing for changes in lung volumes, mild vascular congestion and
 retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed. There is likely a small
 left pleural effusion. There is no new opacity, right pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. Marked enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Little change in the mild vascular congestion, retrocardiac atelectasis,
 probable small left pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly.
