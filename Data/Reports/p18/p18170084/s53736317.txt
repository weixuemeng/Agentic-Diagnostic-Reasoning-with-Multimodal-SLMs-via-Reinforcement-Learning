                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post fall, nasal pain, notable abrasions to
 face. pain in right thumb
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT cervical spine
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Rightward deviation of the trachea
 with a prominent left superior mediastinal soft tissue structure is compatible
 with a multinodular thyroid goiter, as seen on the prior CT of the cervical
 spine.  Lung volumes are low.  This causes crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Streaky bibasilar opacity
 is noted without focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  No displaced fractures are
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Multinodular thyroid goiter
 causing rightward deviation of the trachea, as seen on the CT of the cervical
 spine.
