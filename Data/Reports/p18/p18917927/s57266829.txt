                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Minor opacification of the right lung base
 is probably due to atelectasis.  Lung volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right base opacity, probably atelectasis although pneumonia is hard to
 entirely exclude.  Radiographs could be repeated if there is persistent
 clinical concern for the possibility of developing pneumonia.
