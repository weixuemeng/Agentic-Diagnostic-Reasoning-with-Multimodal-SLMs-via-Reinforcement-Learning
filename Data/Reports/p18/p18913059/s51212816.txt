                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia, diarrhea, question fluid overload or
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating clear
 well expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears normal.  A retrocardiac linear density projecting on the lateral view
 over the lower vertebral bodies is likely a superimposed shadow of
 bronchovasculature with the vertebra.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
