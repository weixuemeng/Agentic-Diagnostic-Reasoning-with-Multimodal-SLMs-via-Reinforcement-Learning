                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of subclavian line placement.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  A right subclavian
 central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Prominence of pulmonary
 vasculature may be due to low lung volumes and resultant bronchovascular
 crowding.   There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged, likely due to technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Right subclavian central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 2. Low lung volumes and findings which may represent mild fulid overload but
 no overt edema.
