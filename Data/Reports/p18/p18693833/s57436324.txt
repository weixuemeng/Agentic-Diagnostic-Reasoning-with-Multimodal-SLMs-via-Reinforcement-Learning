                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Difficulty swallowing, to assess for radiopaque foreign body.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 substantially rotated, making it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. 
 There is new opacification projected over the outer aspect of the lower half
 of the left lung.  It is unclear whether this merely represents overlying soft
 tissues due to change in patient's position.
 
 Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent with pleural effusions. 
 Continued opacification in the right mid and lower zones suggests pneumonia in
 a patient with some interstitial prominence related to elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
