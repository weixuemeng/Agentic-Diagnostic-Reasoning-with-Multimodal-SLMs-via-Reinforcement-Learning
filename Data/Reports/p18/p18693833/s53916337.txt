                                 FINAL REPORT
 CXR PORTABLE FILMS SUPINE.
 
 HISTORY:  Right lower lobe opacity evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the examination done at ___ hours earlier today, there
 is further apparent opacification of the right hemithorax.  This is likely on
 account of layering of the pleural effusion in the supine position compared to
 the semi-erect film earlier in the day.  An endotracheal tube has been placed,
 its tip is satisfactorily lying approximately 7 cm above the carina, not
 allowing for magnification.  Right rib fractures noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Worsening of the opacity throughout the right hemithorax.  Part
 of this is likely due to pleural effusion.  Rib fractures noted as on previous
 CT scan.  Patchy density is also seen in the left lower lung field.
