                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with multiple rib injuries, assess lung fields.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated as seen
 previously.  Increased small pleural effusion on the left.  Right base and
 left perihilar opacifications are now more confluent with evidence of
 peribronchial cuffing suggesting asymmetric pulmonary edema with superimposed
 atelectasis.  Consolidation cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Small left pleural effusion
 2. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral pulmonary
 opacification consistent with superimposed atelectasis and/or consolidation.
