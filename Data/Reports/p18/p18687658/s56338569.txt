                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe MR with IABP. Pulled back balloon
 pump 1cm.  // Please evaluate for IABP position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the IABP has been pulled back and now lies
 slightly below the inferior rim of the aortic knob (the inferior edge of the
 right thumb is indistinct due to rotation, which limits precise measurement).
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Vascular markings are more
 pronounced than on ___, but similar to earlier the same day --___
 could reflect CHF. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
 probably unchanged.  No left effusion identified.  Probable bibasilar
 atelectasis, similar to prior.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of IABP.  The tip now lies slightly below the inferior
 rim of aortic knob.
 
 CHF, similar to earlier the same day, but slightly increased compared with
 this compared with 1 day earlier.
