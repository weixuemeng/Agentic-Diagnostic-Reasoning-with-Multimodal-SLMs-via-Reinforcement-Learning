                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M w/ hx of HTN, recent STEMI s/p DES to RCA with concern for
 ___-___ pericarditis p/w sudden onset DOE, found to have a pericardial
 effusion with tamponade physiology and possible HCAP.  // IABP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with mild unfolding of the aorta.  The radiopacity
 immediately inferior to the aorta likely relates to an aortic balloon pump. 
 The superior tip of the radiopacity lies at the inferior edge of the aortic
 knob,improved in position compared with ___.
 
 Again seen is mild vascular plethora.  Allowing for technical differences,
 this is not significantly changed.
 
 Minimal slightly patchy opacity at both lung bases could represent
 atelectasis.  There has been slight improvement in left base retrocardiac
 density -- the bibasilar appearance is otherwise unchanged.
 
 No focal consolidation or gross effusion.
