 prior  // eval ? cardiomegaly, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is somewhat enlarged and globular in appearance compared to the most
 recent prior.  The aorta is tortuous as before.  Patchy opacities throughout
 both lungs, primarily at the bases, suggests mild edema.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart is minimally enlarged and somewhat globular compared to the most
 recent prior study.  Consider echocardiogram for evaluation of possible
 pericardial effusion.
 
 Bilateral opacities suggest mild pulmonary edema however underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.
