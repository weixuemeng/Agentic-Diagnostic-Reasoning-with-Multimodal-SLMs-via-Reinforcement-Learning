                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M w/ hx of HTN, recent STEMI s/p DES to RCA with concern for
 ___-___ pericarditis p/w sudden onset DOE, found to have a pericardial
 effusion with tamponade physiology and possible HCAP.  // pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 07:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior, possibly minimally larger. 
 .  Presumed aortic balloon pump.  This probably lies slightly higher than on
 the prior study, nowat the level of the inferior aortic knob lumen.  Again
 seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, compatible
 with CHF, slightly more pronounced, with atelectasis in the right
 cardiophrenic and retrocardiac regions.  Findings in the right cardiophrenic
 region are more pronounced.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette is similar, possibly slightly larger.
 CHF findings are slightly worse.
 Aortic balloon pump lies at level of the lower aortic knob lumen.  Clinical
 correlation regarding retraction by approximately 1 cm is requested.
 Bibasilar atelectasis, slightly worse in the right cardiophrenic region
 compared with 1 day earlier.  In the appropriate clinical setting, a pneumonic
 infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
