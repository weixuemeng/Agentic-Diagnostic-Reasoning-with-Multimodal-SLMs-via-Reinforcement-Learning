                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen with subsequent
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings and indistinct pulmonary vasculature.
 There is no effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but again likely
 accentuated due to technique and low inspiratory effort.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this limited exam. 
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette likely accentuated by technique and poor
 inspiratory effort.
