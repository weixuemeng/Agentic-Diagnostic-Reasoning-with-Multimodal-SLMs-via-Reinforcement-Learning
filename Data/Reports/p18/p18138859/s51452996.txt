                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea  // worsening pulmonary edema     
 worsening pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Recent pulmonary edema has largely cleared.  The pulmonary vasculature remains
 engorged and there is still moderate residual left pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomegaly is chronic, and the patient has had moderate pericardial effusion
 as recent as ___.
 
 What is appreciably different than prior chest radiographs is the much larger
 opacity at the base of the right hemi thorax in the region previously occupied
 by just a hiatus hernia.  This could be lower lobe collapse or consolidation
 adjoining the hernia or appreciable right pleural effusion.  CT scanning would
 be diagnostic, but conventional chest radiographs would be helpful as well.
 
 Trans subclavian right atrial and ventricular pacer leads continuous from the
 left pectoral generator, unchanged in their respective positions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs, when feasible.  Chest CT
 scanning if necessary to evaluate new findings.
