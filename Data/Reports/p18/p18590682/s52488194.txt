                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough. S/p AVR, on amio, presented with
 cough  // r/o acute CP changes      r/o acute CP changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration. The cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in
 size and there is no definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There
 is a streak of atelectasis at the left base. Very small area of increased
 opacification is seen on the frontal view at the left base laterally. This may
 well represent atelectatic change, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 developing pneumonia could not be definitely excluded.
