                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right lower lobe pneumonia, sepsis with
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam from earlier the same day at 12:54
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the ches.  Compared to prior there has been no
 significant interval change.  Dense right lower lobe consolidation is again
 seen.  Underlying effusion is not excluded.  Mild opacity is also at the left
 lung base laterally.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change of dense right lower lobe opacity compatible
 with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Please note that a repeat exam
 after treatment should be performed to rule out underlying mass lesion.
