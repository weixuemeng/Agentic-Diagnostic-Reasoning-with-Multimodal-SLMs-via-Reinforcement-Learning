 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:36 PM
   Interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip initially in the proximal
  right mainstem bronchus; subsequent image demonstrates interval retraction of
  the endotracheal tube with tip projecting approximately 4.5 cm above the
  carina. Right subclavian catheter is similarly positioned. Interval placement
  of esophageal catheter which courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view.
  Increased opacification of the right hemithorax, at least some of which is due
  to increased right pleural effusion and increased pulmonary edema, with
  persistent dense right lower lobe opacity. Findings discussed with ___, MICU
  resident, by phone at 8:35 p.m. on ___ at time of discovery of these
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:01 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal and central line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:15 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Right subclavian
 line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  In
 addition to severe right basal consolidation, there is worsening consolidation
 in the right upper lobe and around the left hilus.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion is larger.  Azygous distention indicates a component of volume
 overload.  Heart size is normal.
