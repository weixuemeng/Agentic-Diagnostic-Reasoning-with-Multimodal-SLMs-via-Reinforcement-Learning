 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight decrease
 in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.  The right parenchymal
 opacity at the lung bases, however, persists.  Minimal increase in
 transparency at the left lung bases, potentially reflecting improved
 ventilation.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged monitoring
 and support devices.
