                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yoM w/ PMH of CAD (diagnosed on ETT), HLD, HTN, hypothyroidism
 who recently presented to his private care doctor for abdominal complaints,
 found to have hemolytic anemia, developed STEMI in ED, now s/p LHC showing
 3VCAD and IABP.  // IABP, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen bibasal pleural effusions are no longer apparent. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary hila and haziness of pulmonary vascular is
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  An intra-aortic balloon pump
 is in-situ.  The balloon is distended on the current image.  Bibasal
 atelectasis is likely related to the prior effusions.  The 2 right lower lobe
 pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are not clearly seen on the current
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.  Improvement in the bibasal pleural effusions. 
 IABP in-situ.
