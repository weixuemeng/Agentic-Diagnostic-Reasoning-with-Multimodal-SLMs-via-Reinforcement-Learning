                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Back injury with decreased mobility and significant bilateral lower
 extremity edema and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and vascular stenting. 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with mild calcification of the thoracic aorta again demonstrated.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis or infection.  There is hyperinflation of the lungs with
 flattening of the diaphragms and increased retrosternal clear space compatible
 with underlying COPD.  Previously noted ill-defined opacity in the left upper
 lobe has resolved.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases, which could reflect atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded.
