                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever of 104 degrees.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Again noted is bilateral lower lobe peribronchial wall
 thickening, compatible with chronic obstructive airways disease.  Minimal
 opacity in the right lower lobe could represent subsegmental atelectasis or
 possibly early pneumonia.  The heart is normal in size.  There are changes of
 coronary artery bypass grafting with median sternotomy wires, mediastinal
 clips, vessel markers and LAD/RCA coronary stents.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic obstructive airways disease.
 2.  Right lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis or potentially early pneumonia
 in the appropriate settin.
