                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with gangrenous gallbladder, now status post
 perc chole placement, recent desaturation and agitation, question
 cardiopulmonary pathology.  
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 A portable frontal chest film ___ at ___ was acquired.  Imaging was
 challenging as the patient is agitated and unable to fully cooperate.  Many of
 the images acquired have overlying motion artifact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain quite low, and there is crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature with no definite overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar linear
 opacities suggest atelectasis.  The heart remains enlarged, although assessing
 for interval change in the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging due
 to the overlying motion and markedly diminished lung volumes.  The main
 pulmonary artery is prominent, raising the possibility of underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  There is likely a right chronic rotator cuff tear
 given the narrowed acromiohumeral distance and superior subluxation of the
 humeral head relative to the glenoid.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although
 the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
