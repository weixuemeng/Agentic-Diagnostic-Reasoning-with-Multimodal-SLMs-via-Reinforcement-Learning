 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A moderate interstitial abnormality has
 markedly increased suggesting moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  There
 are also patchy posterior opacities that are more focal than elsewhere, but
 probably due to atelectasis and edema.  Very small bilateral pleural effusions
 are suspected and fissures are mildly thickened.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.  If
 symptoms were to persist after treatment, then followup radiographs could be
 considered since there is a patchy focal posterior basilar opacity, probably
 part of the same process, although coinciding infection is difficult to
 completely exclude.
