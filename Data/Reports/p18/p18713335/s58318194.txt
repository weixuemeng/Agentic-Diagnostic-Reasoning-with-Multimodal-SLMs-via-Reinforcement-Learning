                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke and fever, questionable pneumonia.  Rule out pathologic
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac
 silhouette is moderately increased.  Given lower lung volumes, there is more
 crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures, notably at the lung bases,
 but no pulmonary edema is present.  No pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No
 lung nodules or masses.
