                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper chest and back pain.  Please evaluate for bony pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 An overall limited evaluation of the bony structures due to technique is
 negative for acute pathology.  Degenerative changes are seen at bilateral
 glenohumeral joints with probable loss of the normal joint space.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of
 gross bony abnormality on these non-dedicated views.  Further dedicated
 osseous radiography can be considered for full evaluation.
