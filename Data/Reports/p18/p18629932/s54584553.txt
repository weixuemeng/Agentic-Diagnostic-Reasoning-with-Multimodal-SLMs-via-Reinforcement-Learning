 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line.
 
 Compared to the prior study the right PICC has been pulled, now projects over
 the expected location at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is normal.  Bibasilar opacities have markedly
 improved consistent with improving pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Right
 perihilar atelectasis has also improved.
