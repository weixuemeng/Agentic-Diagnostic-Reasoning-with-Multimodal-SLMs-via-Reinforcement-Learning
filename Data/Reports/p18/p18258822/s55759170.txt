                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleuritic left-sided flank/rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there are subtle bibasilar opacities which most likely represent
 atelectasis.  However, early infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 The mediastinum is also likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings in
 the cardiac silhouette.  Mild bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis; however, early infectious process is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
