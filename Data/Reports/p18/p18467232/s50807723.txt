                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gradual worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is moderate to severely enlarged
 with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta is diffusely tortuous and
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  More focal patchy opacities in the lung bases could reflect
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Left apical
 pulmonary parenchymal scarring appears similar compared to the prior exam. 
 Compression deformities of multiple vertebral bodies at the thoracolumbar
 junction are noted, some of which appear to have been present on the CT of the
 lumbar spine from ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions and mild
 pulmonary edema.  More focal opacities in the lung bases could reflect
 atelectasis but infection and aspiration cannot be excluded.  Multiple
 compression deformities within the thoracolumbar junction, some of which
 appear relatively unchanged from ___.
