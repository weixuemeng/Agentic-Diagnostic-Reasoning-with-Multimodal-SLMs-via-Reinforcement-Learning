                                 FINAL REPORT
 TWO-VIEW CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, a feeding tube has been replaced with
 nasointestinal tube terminating in the third portion of the duodenum. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Improving linear atelectasis is
 present in the periphery of the right lower lobe, but a worsening patchy and
 linear opacity is demonstrated in the retrocardiac portion of the left lower
 lobe.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening patchy and linear left lower lobe opacity favors
 atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
