 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:22 PM
  Patchy new mixed vague and nodular opacities in the right lower lung, possibly
  due to sarcoidosis, although infectious or inflammatory processes cannot be
  excluded.  Persistent moderate mediastinal and bilateral hilar
  lymphadenopathy. Chest radiographs should be performed to follow-up, or CT if
  one has not been done since ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___,
 as scanned into the ___ PACS, from ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There are enlarged hilar structures
 bilaterally, previously shown to reflect lymphadenopathy, which appears
 similar in extent.  Streaky left retrocardiac density suggests atelectasis. 
 There is a patchy new perihilar nodular area of opacification nodular
 component of 8 mm.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy new mixed vague and nodular opacities in the right lower
 lung, possibly due to sarcoidosis, although infectious or inflammatory
 processes cannot be excluded.  Persistent moderate mediastinal and bilateral
 hilar lymphadenopathy.  
 
 Noting that there were multiple pulmonary nodules on the prior chest CT as
 well as a persistent marked mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, if more
 recent prior chest CT imaging is not available from an outside source, then
 followup chest CT should be considered when clinically appropriate. 
 Otherwise, followup radiographs are recommended in order to assess for
 resolution or persistence of superimposed right perihilar opacities.
