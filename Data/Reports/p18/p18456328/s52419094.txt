  There are increased bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is likely in part secondary to pleural
  effusion although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Mild to moderate
  cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lung volumes are low. Mild pulmonary edema is not
  significantly changed.
