 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, crackles on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size is mild
 to moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable, with the thoracic aorta appearing mildly tortuous.  Mild pulmonary
 edema appears relatively similar compared to the prior study.  Subsegmental
 atelectasis is noted in both lung bases.  Possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC has been
 removed.  Degenerative changes of the imaged thoracic spine and right
 acromioclavicular joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
