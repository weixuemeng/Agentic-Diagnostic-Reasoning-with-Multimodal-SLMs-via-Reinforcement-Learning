                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  At the medial right lung base, there is streaky opacification
 more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  A band-like opacity in the
 left costophrenic sulcus suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.  The partly
 visualized left shoulder shows narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval that
 could be seen with rotator cuff pathology.  The bones appear demineralized. 
 Compression deformities at the thoracolumbar junction with mild loss in
 vertebral body heights among mid-to-lower thoracic vertebral bodies are not
 well delineated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right posterior basilar opacification in the right lower
 lobe, more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  Thoracolumbar
 compression deformities, not well delineated due to overlying soft tissues. 
 Bony demineralization.  Suspected rotator cuff pathology on the left.
