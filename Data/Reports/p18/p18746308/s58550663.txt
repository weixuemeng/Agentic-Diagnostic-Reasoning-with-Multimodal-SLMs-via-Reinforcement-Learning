                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/agitation, please eval for occult PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm more accentuated than on prior, potentially in part due to
 patient positioning.  There is no focal consolidation or edema.  Blunting of
 the left  posterior costophrenic angle could represent a trace effusion. 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement is accentuated by AP technique.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation without acute cardiopulmonary process.
