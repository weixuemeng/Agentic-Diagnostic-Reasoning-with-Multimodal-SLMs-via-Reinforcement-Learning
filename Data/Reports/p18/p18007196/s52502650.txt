                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited by a kyphotic positioning and the patient's chin and
 neck obscuring assessment of the medial aspect of the lung apices.  Heart size
 is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Calcified
 scarring is noted within the lung apices.  No focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized with age indeterminate multiple compression
 deformities noted in the imaged thoracic spine including a moderate to severe
 mid thoracic vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Multiple
 compression deformities of indeterminate age within the thoracic spine.
