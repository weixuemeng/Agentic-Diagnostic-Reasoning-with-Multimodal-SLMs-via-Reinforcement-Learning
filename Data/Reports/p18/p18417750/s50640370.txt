                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Aortic valve replacement with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device with two leads appears unchanged. 
 The patient is status post endovascular aortic valve replacement.  Mitral
 annular calcifications are present.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A mild new interstitial
 abnormality suggests vascular congestion, but no focal opacities are
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 The patient is again status post vertebroplasty of the T10 vertebral body
 which demonstrates a fragmented moderate compression deformity with slight
 retropulsion of the dominant posterior fragment, but not significantly
 changed.  Prior posterior fusion involving T10 and T11 also appears unchanged.
 A moderate biconcave L1 compression deformity appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
