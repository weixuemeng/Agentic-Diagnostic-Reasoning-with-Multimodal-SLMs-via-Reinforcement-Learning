                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever, chills, generalized chest pain and
 right basal crackles.  Suspect right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Cardiac silhouette has grown quite large, accompanied by small bilateral
 pleural effusions, normal pulmonary vasculature and only minimal increase in
 caliber of mediastinal veins.  I suspect this is due largely to pericardial
 effusion, presumably not acute, since there is no evidence of tamponade. 
 Greater opacity at the base of the right lung could be the vestiges of
 pneumonia, or simply atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Findings were
 discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 4:30, two minutes following
 recognition of the findings.
