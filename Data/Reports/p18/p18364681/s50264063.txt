                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion from unknown
 source.  Scheduled for ___ when she has to return for echocardiography.  Any
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination of ___ which apparently has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  It is different and even when paying attention to AP
 versus PA frontal projection, the overall heart size has been reduced,
 apparently related to successful pericardiocentesis during the interval. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions persist and are probably equal in size.  They are
 now clearly blunting the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses as the patient
 is in upright position on the present examination.  The accessible pulmonary
 vasculature does not show any congestive pattern, nor is there any upper zone
 redistribution when patient is in upright position.  No pneumothorax can be
 identified.  The heart shadow configuration is not revealing.  An absence of
 significant left atrial enlargement is, however, noted on the lateral view and
 confirms the absence of any significant pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with polyserositis with pericardial and
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 The patient underwent a PA and lateral chest x-ray on ___ with
 images taken in upright position.  Comparison with this study is identifying a
 now smaller heart shadow and the amount of pleural effusions has clearly
 increased.
 
 Further followup recommended.
