                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pericardiocentesis, pleural effusion,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous films dated ___ at
 8:51.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall cardiac contour appears somewhat smaller than on previous study in
 this patient status post pericardiocentesis for a pericardial effusion.  There
 continued to be layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar
 airspace opacities, which most likely represent partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is
 cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous
 hypertension but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen, although
 the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. 
 Overall mediastinal contours are stable.
