                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large layering right pleural effusion appears slightly
 increased compared to the prior study, although positional differences may in
 part contribute to this apparent change.  Small left pleural effusion has
 apparently decreased in size.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is
 accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
