                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of acute onset
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is rotated slightly.  There is mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Subtle bibasilar opacities likely relate to atelectasis.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, though likely accentuated by AP technique.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.
