                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer admitted with pneumonia, interval
 evaluation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from  ___ through ___. 
 Chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since ___, a subtle left lower lobe opacity has improved and likely
 represents a resolving pneumonia.  The scarring in the right middle and left
 upper lobes is unchanged and fully assessed on CT scan from ___.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Two sclerotic thoracic vertebral bodies, one with a
 compression deformity are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved appearance of left lower lobe opacity, which likely represents a
 resolving pneumonia.  Otherwise, stable chest radiograph.
