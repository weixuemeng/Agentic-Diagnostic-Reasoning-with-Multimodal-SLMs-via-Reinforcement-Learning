                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior imaging is available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a
 central venous catheter, terminating in the right ventricle, which should be
 retracted 9 to 10 cm for appropriate position just above the cavoatrial
 junction.  There is elevation of theright hemidiaphragm.  Right mid lung
 opacity may be due to atelectasis secondary to low lung volume on the right;
 however, infection cannot be excluded.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right mid lung opacity, possibly atelectasis given low lung volumes,
 however, infection is not excluded.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous line terminates in right ventricle
 and should be re-positioned.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
 at ___, five minutes after discovery.
