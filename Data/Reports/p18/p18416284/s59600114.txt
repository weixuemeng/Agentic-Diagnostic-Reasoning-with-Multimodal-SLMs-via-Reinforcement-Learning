                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with re-positioning of central venous line.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest obtained three
 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval re-positioning of the right internal jugular central
 venous catheter, which now terminates in appropriate position in the distal
 SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is unchanged since the prior study.
 Hazy density at the right base with aparent retraction of the minor fissure is
 suggestive of prominent right middle lobe atelectasis. If clinically
 indicated, a lateral view could help to confirm this.  Is there any concern
 for airway obstruction?
