                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with generalized weakness  // R/O CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen pelvis ___. Atrius chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new. The lungs are
 well-expanded.  Right suprahilar, poorly defined round opacity has rapidly
 progressed since the recent CXR. Slight increased interstitial markings
 compared to the recent chest radiograph is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Rapid progression of complex right upper lobe opacity. Such rapid change
 favors an infectious process over neoplasm, but followup radiographs after
 antibiotic therapy are recommended to document resolution. If persistent, CT
 of the chest would be recommended
 
 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion. Bilateral interstitial opacities may reflect
 interstitial edema in this setting, but an atypical pneumonia is also possible
 
 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions
