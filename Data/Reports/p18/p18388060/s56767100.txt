                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 widening of the right paratracheal stripe compatible with lymphadenopathy. 
 Hilar enlargement bilaterally is also due to the presence of lymphadenopathy.
 Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe is unchanged from the prior
 radiograph, and may reflect a combination of post biopsy hemorrhage and
 malignancy. There is mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis is likely present.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Similar appearance of ill-defined right upper lobe opacity likely
 reflecting a combination of malignancy and post biopsy changes.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema, small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
