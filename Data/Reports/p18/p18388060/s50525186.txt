                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits. Bilaterally there small nodular densities that suggest nipple
 shadows., larger on the left than right.  In addition there is a second
 nodular focus on the left which is round and measures approximately 8 mm which
 raises concern for potential parenchymal nodule.  Trace pleural effusions are
 present bilaterally.  There is no pneumothorax. The finding of minimal
 fissural thickening may indicate slight fluid overload but there is no
 parenchymal edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible pulmonary nodules. Particularly given relatively high density, a
 combination of nipple shadows and a granuloma may explain the findings, but to
 exclude nodules, chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate.
 
 The findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ by telephone.
