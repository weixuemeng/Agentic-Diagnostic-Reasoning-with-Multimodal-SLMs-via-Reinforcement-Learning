 Airspace opacities at the right suprahilar are slightly less prominent on
 today's exam.  However, new post procedural changes in the right upper lobe
 have developed.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a decreased small
 layering right pleural effusion. The heart and mediastinum are within normal
 limits despite the projection.  There is no obvious left pleural effusion.

 Short-term followup radiographs would be helpful to assess for resolution.
