 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cecal mass, status post colonoscopy, evaluation for pneumonia.

 is slightly elevated.  As a consequence, small basal left atelectasis is seen.
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is normal.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
