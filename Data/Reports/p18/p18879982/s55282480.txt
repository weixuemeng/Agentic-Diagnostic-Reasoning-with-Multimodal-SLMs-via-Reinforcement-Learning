 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:36 PM
  New left basilar opacity which is likely representative of atelectasis though
  a layering pleural effusion/hemothorax cannot be excluded. Post-surgical
  pneumomediastinum is stable. Mild edema again noted. ET tube removed. ___-
  ___ in place. A one hour interval radiograph is recommended to further assess
  the left base for possible increase in size.
  
  ___ ___ ___ at 7:15 pm on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dropping hematocrit in a patient after aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 11:41 a.m.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  The Swan-Ganz catheter
 inserted through the right internal jugular approach terminates at the level
 of the right ventricle outflow tract.  Cardiac silhouette is stable. 
 Substantial amount of pneumopericardium is present.  There is interval
 substantial improvement up to almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema. 
 Left retrocardiac opacity is persistent, consistent with atelectasis.  Small
 amount of pleural effusion is seen, decreased since the prior study.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is present.  
 
 Although the left retrocardiac opacity might reflect loculated hemothorax, the
 lack of interval increase in overall amount of pleural effusion makes it less
 likely.
