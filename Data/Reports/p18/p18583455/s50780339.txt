 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly low.  The lungs are clear.  The heart
 is top normal in size.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The esophagus is air-filled and dilated at the level of the thoracic
 inlet.  There is a spinal stimulator device projecting along the posterior

 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiac or pulmonary
 process, although this examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis
 of pulmonary embolism.
