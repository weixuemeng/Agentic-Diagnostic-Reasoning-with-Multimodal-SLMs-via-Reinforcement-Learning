                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  CHF, leukocytosis and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in conjunction with imaging of the
 lower chest on yesterday's abdomen CT:
 
 Generalized hyperinflation is consistent with COPD.  There is no edema,
 pulmonary vascular engorgement or consolidation, but there is asymmetry in the
 lung apices.  The left shows pleural parenchymal scarring.  On the right, a
 somewhat greater opacity as large as 3 cm across could be more exuberant
 scarring, but raises concern for an apical lung mass.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcification is heavy in both
 carotids in the neck and in the descending portion of the tortuous but not
 dilated thoracic aorta.  Thoracolumbar scoliosis is mild to moderately severe.
 There is no evidence of central adenopathy.  Thoracolumbar scoliosis is
 moderately severe.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
 
 Dr. ___ and I discussed the findings and their clinical significance
 over the telephone at the time of report approval.
