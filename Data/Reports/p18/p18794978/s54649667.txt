                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with seizure and concern for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are no prior films in our system for comparison.  The ET tube
 is about 2 cm from the carina.  The NG tube courses below the diaphragm with
 the tip off the film.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 are overall low lung volumes.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity as well as
 a right basilar patchy opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 2 cm from the carina, which should be withdrawn by approximately 2
 cm.
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
 3.  Right basal consolidation consistent with atelectasis.
