                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known left lower lobe pneumonia, status post seven-day antibiotic
 course.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a persistent opacity at the right base, which appears
 slightly more confluent than on the prior exam.  The right effusion has
 improved, though a small one persists.  There is a small retrocardiac opacity
 with associated volume loss and a small left pleural effusion.  This likely
 represents atelectasis, though an associated pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  The tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly more confluent right basilar opacity, consistent with persistent,
 possibly worsening, pneumonia.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis, though a component of
 continued pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
 3.  Small left pleural effusion.
