                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall down the stairs with audible wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote prior study from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are essentially unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  One
 change is that the central pulmonary arteries appears somewhat larger and the
 lungs are hyperinflated suggesting there may be obstructive lung disease. 
 There is suspected hiatal hernia, moderate in size and located somewhat to the
 left line, but similar to the remote prior study.  Streaky left basilar
 opacities suggest associated atelectasis or scarring.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  Mild
 rightward convex curvature is centered along the mid thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which may suggest obstructive pulmonary disease with
 streaky left basilar opacification, most suggestive of atelectasis, in
 association with a suspected hiatal hernia.
