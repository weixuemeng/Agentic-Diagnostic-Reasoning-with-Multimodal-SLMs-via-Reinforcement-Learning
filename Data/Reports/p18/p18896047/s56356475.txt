 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Medial bibasilar linear opacities appear similar compared to prior and likely
 represent atelectasis or scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected. Hyperinflation is due to
 bronchospasm or COPD. Lateral view suggests left ventricular enlargement or
 pericardial effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Possible COPD or acute bronchospasm. 
 Possible left ventricular enlargement or pericardial.
