 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are relatively hyperinflated, which may be due to chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is minimal biapical pleural thickening.  The
 cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
