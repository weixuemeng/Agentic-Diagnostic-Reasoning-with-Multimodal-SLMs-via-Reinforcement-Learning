                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the axilla of the right side.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is moderately tortuous and calcified.  There is
 widespread mild interstitial abnormality suggesting mild fluid overload or
 pulmonary vascular congestion, including peribronchial cuffing.  More focal
 patchy left basilar and vague focal left upper lobe opacities could probably
 be seen with pneumonia although patchy atelectasis could be considered for
 left posterior basilar opacification.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of mild vascular congestion.  Patchy
 opacities in the left upper and left lower lobes could be seen with pneumonia.
