                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 420 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new wheezing, evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 420 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in a bilateral interstitial process and fullness of the
 perihilar vasculature which likely reflects mild to moderate pulmonary and
 interstitial edema.  A diffuse pneumonia would be less likely.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, although the aortic knob is
 somewhat prominent, raising the possibility of an aneurysm.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
