                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia and bilateral pleural
 effusions, now with tachycardia and increased oxygen demand, here to evaluate
 for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided PICC line is again seen with
 the tip terminating in the right axilla unchanged from prior chest
 radiographs.  The PICC needs to be repositioned for proper placement in the
 low SVC.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved from ___ but persistent. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.  Probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions with associated atelectasis obscure the costophrenic angles.  Low
 inspiratory lung volumes are unchanged.  Prominence of the mediastinum suggest
 an ectatic thoracic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC terminating in the right axilla needs repositioning to place in
 the low SVC.
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema improved from ___.
