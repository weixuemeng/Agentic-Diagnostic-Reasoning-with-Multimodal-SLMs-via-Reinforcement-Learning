                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, low-grade temperature at home.  Assess for pneumonia
 or other acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA, upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Patchy reticulonodular opacities are redemonstrated in both lungs,
 more conspicuous on the right.  The right basal nodular opacities are slightly
 more prominent.  Calcified pleural plaques are also noted. No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  A tortuous aorta is noted along with
 median sternotomy wires and aortic valve prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION: Reticulonodular opacities in both lungs in a similar distribution
 as the prior study compatible with chronic MAC infection.
 Asbestos related calcified pleural plaques.
