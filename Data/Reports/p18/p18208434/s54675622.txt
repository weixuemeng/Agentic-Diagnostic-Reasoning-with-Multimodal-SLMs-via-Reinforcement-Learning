                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, Dementia, presents from nursing home
 with cough, found to be tachycardic and hypotensive  // evaluate for
 consolidation vs pneumonia     evaluate for consolidation vs pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change. 
 Extensive fibrotic process is again noted as well as dense calcification in
 the region of the mitral annulus.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Pulmonary changes, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
