                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain following very recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The posterior
 costophrenic sulci are not well visualized, but there is no clear indication
 of pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small-to-moderate quantity
 of free air is visualized under each hemidiaphragm, but anticipated following
 very recent abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Free air, anticipated in the early
 post-surgical course.
