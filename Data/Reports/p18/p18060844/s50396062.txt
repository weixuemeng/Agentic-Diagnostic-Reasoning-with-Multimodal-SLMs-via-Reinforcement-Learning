                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 although there is a vague right perihilar opacity which is concerning for an
 early infectious process.  Markedly asymmetric pulmonary edema seems less
 likely.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague perihilar opacity for which developing pneumonia versus
 aspiration is a consideration.  Short-term followup radiographs are suggested
 to reassess in addition to correlation with clinical presentation.
