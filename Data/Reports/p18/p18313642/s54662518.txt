                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Mild prominence of interstitial markings could reflect
 chronic lung disease, mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, or both. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen, as well as thickening of one of
 the major fissures, all suggestive of a small amount of pleural fluid.
 
 No definite acute focal pneumonia.
