                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is rotated to the left.  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggests
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle which may in part relate to overlying soft tissue, although small
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis may be present.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity may represent combination of vascular congestion and basilar
 atelectasis with possible small pleural effusion, although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patient is rotated to the left.  Prominence and indistinctness of
 the hila suggest component of vascular congestion/engorgement.  Blunted left
 costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue, although pleural
 effusion with atelectasis or even consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Persistent cardiomegaly.
