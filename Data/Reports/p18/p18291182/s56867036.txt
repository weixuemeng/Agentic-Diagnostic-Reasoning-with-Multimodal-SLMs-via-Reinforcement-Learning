                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with 10-day history of cough, fever and coarse
 rales on physical exam, here to evaluate for left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show an opacification
 projecting over the left heart on the frontal radiograph and the posterior
 lung base on the corresponding lateral radiograph consistent with left lower
 lobar pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobar pneumonia.  A followup chest radiograph in four
 to six weeks after appropriate therapy is recommended to confirm resolution.
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ by phone at 13:15
