                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, hx of metastatic hepatocellular carcinioma  //
 eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP upright and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac size is mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by the AP projection.
 There is no pleural effusion.  Lung volumes are low. A retrocardiac opacity is
 noted and also seen on the lateral view which may represent a hiatal hernia,
 though more pronounced when compared with the prior exam. Difficult to exclude
 a subjacent pneumonia/mass. Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity which may represent a hiatal hernia, though somewhat
 increased as compared with prior exam, raising potential for subjacent
 pneumonia/mass.
