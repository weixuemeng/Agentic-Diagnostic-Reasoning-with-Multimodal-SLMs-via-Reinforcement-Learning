                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with variceal bleeding, now status post TIPS, gastric
 bypass complicated by marginal ulcer, now with acute GI bleed.  Question
 interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  The right
 PICC line appears to have been retracted slightly compared with the earlier
 film -- the tip now overlies the distal SVC. Note is again made of the
 fixation hardware in the lower cervical spine.
 
 There may be very slight improvement in the degree of aeration at the left
 base.  Otherwise, extensive bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities are
 without significant change. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) CHF, similar to prior.  
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation may be slightly improved. 
 Right base opacity is largely unchanged.
 3) Interval slight retraction of PICC line, with tip now overlying distal SVC.
 No pneumothorax detected.
