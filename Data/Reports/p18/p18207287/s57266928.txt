                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Orogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 orogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 projects over the mid parts of the stomach.  The sidehole is not clearly
 visualized.  There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 The patient is also intubated.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is minimal
 fluid overload and atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas, but no evidence
 of acute changes such as pneumonia or overt pulmonary edema.  The previously
 described signs indicative of pulmonary edema have decreased in the interval.
