                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, acute GI bleed.  Films dated ___ at 5:13 a.m.
 presented now for official interpretation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 16:54 p.m.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  An NG type
 tube is present, faintly seen, extending beneath the diaphragm.  A right-sided
 PICC line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction, apparently retracted compared
 with the film from the most recent prior film.  The right apex is obscured by
 overlying material, but no obvious pneumothorax is identified. The patient's
 cervical fixation hardware is again noted.  
 
 There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to prior. 
 There is pulmonary vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF, possibly
 slightly improved.  There is patchy opacity at both lung bases, consistent
 with collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  PICC line tip now lies at the SVC/RA junction.
 2.  CHF, with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  Vascular plethora may
 be slightly improved.  The bibasilar changes are similar to the prior film.
