                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, on Coumadin, with confusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Previously identified right apical pneumothorax is
 no longer visualized.  Linear bibasilar opacities, suggestive of scar versus
 atelectasis, again noted.  Small left pleural effusion persists, unchanged.
 Trace right pleural effusion also persists.   Superiorly, the lungs are clear.
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  Median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of right apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no
 change.  Persistent small left pleural effusion and probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.
