                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with myasthenia, aspiration pneumonia,
 continued oxygen requirement, assess for new infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single views were obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size remains normal and no configurational abnormalities
 are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Relatively low
 positioned and flattened diaphragms are again identified and indicate COPD and
 emphysematous changes.  Irregular pulmonary vascular distribution in the
 periphery is also seen and some linear densities raise the possibility of
 interstitial fibrosis or scar formations.  The previously existing and poorly
 identified right internal jugular vein approach central venous line has been
 exchanged to a wider bore catheter that is now identified to reach well into
 the lower SVC.  There are now several poorly delineated infiltrates in the
 left lung both in the upper lung field as well as in perihilar position and on
 the base.  These densities are compatible with multiple aspiration infiltrates
 in this patient.  Noteworthy is that on the previous examination some of these
 densities were already detectable albeit not to the same extent as they exist
 now.  A previously suspected retrocardiac density on the right base has not
 developed further but cannot be evaluated in detail on this single plain chest
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple parenchymal densities in the left hemithorax compatible
 with aspiration pneumonitis.
