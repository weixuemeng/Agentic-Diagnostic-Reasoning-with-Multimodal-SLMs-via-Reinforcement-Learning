                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and question of pneumonia on
 outside hospital radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal upright views of the chest were obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased retrocardiac
 density may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting. There is also increased density at the right heart border in the
 infrahilar region, which may represent vessels or infection. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Distortion of pulmonary vasculature
 suggests underlying chronic lung disease.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  A right internal jugular catheter courses into at least
 the distal SVC but distal aspect is not well seen due to underpenetration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Comparison with prior may be helpful.
 2. Right infrahilar opacity partially obscuring the right heart border may be
 vessels or pneumonia.
 3. Distal aspect of right internal jugular catheter is not well seen. Consider
 repeat radiograph.
