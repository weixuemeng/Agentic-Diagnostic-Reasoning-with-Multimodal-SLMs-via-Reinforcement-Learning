 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach and hypoxia  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New rightward mediastinal shift despite the development of a small right
 pleural effusion in the interim indicates substantial new volume loss in the
 right lung predominantly lower lobe.  This can be seen due to aspiration and
 therefore the patient is probably at risk for developing pneumonia. Left lung
 is clear. Heart size is normal. Tracheostomy is unremarkable.
