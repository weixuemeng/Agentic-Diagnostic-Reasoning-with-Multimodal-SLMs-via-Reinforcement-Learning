                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:46 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new cough.  Suspect pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been a slight increase in pulmonary vascular caliber, but no
 distention of mediastinal veins or increase in size of top normal cardiac
 silhouette.  Therefore, the new opacification at the right lung base is
 difficult to ascribe specifically to asymmetric edema, atelectasis, aspiration
 or early pneumonia.  Therefore, close followup is advised.  Thickening of the
 pleural margins is largely fat.  If there is any pleural effusion, it is
 small.  No pneumothorax.
