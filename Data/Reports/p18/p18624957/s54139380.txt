                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with flash pulmonary edema.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier on the same date and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the radiograph of 1 hr prior, pulmonary edema has worsened,
 although the heart size is slightly smaller.  This is likely due to vascular
 redistribution after intubation, with an endotracheal tube tip 4.4 cm above
 the carina.  The new NG tube is in the stomach.  No new focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of pulmonary edema, with a smaller heart, likely due to
 vascular redistribution after intubation
