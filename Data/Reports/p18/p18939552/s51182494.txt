                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and
 recent colonoscopy, now with fevers.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT of the chest with contrast
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are
 clear; subtle opacity at the right lung base likely represents the overlying
 breast shadow.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is present.  Right axillary clips are compatible
 with prior lymph node dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia, and no subdiaphragmatic free air.
