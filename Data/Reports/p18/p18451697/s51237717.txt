                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Exploratory laparotomy, evaluation of lung changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are relatively low.  There is a minimal increase
 in radiodensity over the right basal hemithorax.  This could be positional or
 caused by a minimal right pleural effusion.  However, it is impossible to
 evaluate this suspicion without a lateral radiograph.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unremarkable.  Minimal atelectasis in the left
 perihilar areas.  Low lung volumes and borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No free subdiaphragmatic air.
