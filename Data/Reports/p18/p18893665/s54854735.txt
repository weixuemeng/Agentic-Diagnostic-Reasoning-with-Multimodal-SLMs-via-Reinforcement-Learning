                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are markedly low in comparison to
 the ___ study.  The patient is slightly rotated rightwards.  The
 heart appears slightly enlarged.  The central pulmonary vessels are prominent,
 and hazy patchy densities scattered across the lung parenchyma, widening the
 upper mediastinum and obscuring the borders and aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy bilateral pulmonary densities likely representing pulmonary
 edema. Multifocal pneumonia is also a possibility given known septic history. 
 Apparent mediastinal widening is likely due to very low lung volumes.
 
 These initial findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 2:00 a.m.
 on ___.
