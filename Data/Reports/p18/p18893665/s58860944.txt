 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis and SBP with severe abdominal pain and new NG tube
 placement, assess for position.

 FINDINGS:  NG tube which was previously coiled in the patient's oropharynx has
 been removed and positioned appropriately with tip terminating in the proximal
 duodenum.  There is otherwise no change from the prior study with left
 subclavian terminating at the confluence of brachiocephalic veins and low lung
 volumes, large heart, likely trace left effusion with right costophrenic
 sulcus excluded from the film.  Mild pulmonary edema is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube with tip in the proximal duodenum.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema with likely left pleural effusion.
