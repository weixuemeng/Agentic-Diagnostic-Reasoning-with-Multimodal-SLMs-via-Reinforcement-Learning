                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with lung cancer and
 pneumonia with worsening respiratory status.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT and chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier.
 
 In this short interim there is progression of the right perihilar opacities
 that given their diffuse distribution most likely represent interval
 development of pulmonary edema superimposed on multifocal infection.  Hilar
 lymphadenopathy on the right as well as post-surgical changes on the left are
 similar to the prior radiograph.  The ET tube of recently intubated patient
 terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
