                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior CT torso dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue with history of metastatic lung cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Surgical clips
 are noted along the left mediastinal border with extensive scarring and upward
 hilar retraction.  There is volume loss in the left lung compatible with prior
 partial lung resection with partial osteotomy in the left rib cage. There is
 right hilar prominence and lymphadenopaty cannot be excluded. There is no
 definite sign of pneumonia. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes in the left upper lung. No evidence of
 pneumonia. Right hilar prominence. Recommend correlation with nonemergent CT.
