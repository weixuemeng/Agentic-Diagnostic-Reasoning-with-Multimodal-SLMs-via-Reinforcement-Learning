                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sudden difficulty breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___, CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is severely limited by technique, and the left
 costophrenic angle is not entirely captured on this study.  Within these
 limitations, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate
 cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax.  The left basilar consolidation
 appears unchanged, likely representing a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. There is no right pleural effusion. Aortic stent graft and
 tracheostomy are in unchanged position.  There is no new focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No interval change.
