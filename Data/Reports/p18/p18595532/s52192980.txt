                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but similar.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 present.  Streaky and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
