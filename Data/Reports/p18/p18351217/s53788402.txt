 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nephroureteral stent and external drain tip are seen in the
 approximate location of the right kidney.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted but
 there are no frank consolidations to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  There is mild enlargement of the perihilar vessels
 suggesting increased invascular volume but no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 The heart is normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no frank consolidations to
 suggest pneumonia.
