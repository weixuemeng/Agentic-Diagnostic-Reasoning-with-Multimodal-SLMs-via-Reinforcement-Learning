                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___ obtained at___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the left lower lobe, there is hazy opacification, which most
 likely is due to atelectasis, but early pneumonia cannot be fully excluded. 
 No other consolidations are noted.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The
 mediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity is most likely atelectasis, although an early
 pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
