                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic lesions in the head. Question acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The right hilum is enlarged with distorted
 architecture worrisome for the presence of a mass with patchy surrounding
 pneumonitis, lymphatic congestion, or perhaps infiltration of potential tumor.
 More generally there is increased interstitial prominence in the right lung
 which may indicate lymphatic obstruction but potentially even carcinomatosis.
 However the radiograph does not prove the presence of malignancy and the
 possibility should be considered using chest CT, preferably with contrast
 enhancement, if feasible. The chest is hyperinflated. The left lung appears
 clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are no suspicious
 bony findings.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right hilar abnormality and abnormal interstitial process suspected in the
 right lung. Findings raise concern for malignancy. Evaluation with chest CT is
 recommended.
