                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with MVC  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP supine portable chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 This is thought to result in apparent cardiomegaly, exaggerated by expiratory
 films, the heart probably normal in size.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  No air under the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Ribs are without an
 obvious displaced rib fracture.  Clavicles appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  No rib fracture.  If concern for
 fracture, consider rib films with radiopaque marker indicating site of
 concern.
