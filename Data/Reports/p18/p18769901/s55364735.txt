                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia with walking pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large hiatal hernia containing multiple air-fluid levels.  Amorphous
 calcifications are again seen projecting over the left upper lobe.  No new
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no large
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia without definite focal consolidation. 
 However, evaluation of the retrocardiac region is partially obscured by the
 large hiatal hernia.
