                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hypertension and recent fall. 
 The patient has cough for one week and showed questionable opacity on
 admission chest x-ray.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 The patient is now examined in upright position using PA and lateral chest
 views.  Moderate cardiac enlargement appears unchanged but noteworthy is that
 there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The very large hiatal
 hernia, seen to contain major portion of the stomach, is again noted.  The
 retrocardiac position of this lesion pushes on the posterior cardiac contour
 decreasing the depth dimension of the heart and possibly contributes to the
 suspected mild cardiac enlargement on the frontal view.  This very large
 hernia also has some impact on the pulmonary structures and probably accounts
 for the linear densities in the adjacent right-sided basal pulmonary
 vasculature, causing some partial atelectasis.  New acute parenchymal
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  There is now a mild blunting of the right
 lateral pleural sinus which also extends into the posterior area.  This is
 compatible with a small amount of pleural effusion.  Several clusters of small
 pulmonary partially calcified abnormalities in the left upper lobe area remain
 unchanged and have been described on previous chest CT (___) as
 representing post-radiation abnormalities.  The patient is status post
 left-sided mastectomy as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings. On the right-side a small amount of
 pleural fluid is noted, no other pulmonary, cardiovascular or parenchymal
 abnormalities are identified.  No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
