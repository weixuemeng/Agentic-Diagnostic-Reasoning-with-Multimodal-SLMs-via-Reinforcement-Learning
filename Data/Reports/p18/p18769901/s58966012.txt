                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged with a large hiatal
 hernia re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Calcifications projecting over the left upper lung field are unchanged, and
 demonstrated on the prior chest CTA to be within the left upper anterior chest
 wall.  Patchy opacity is noted within the right lung base, with minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus suggestive of a trace pleural
 effusion.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Hyperinflation of the
 lungs is noted.  The patient is status post left mastectomy.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy right basilar opacity with minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle may be suggestive of atelectasis or infection with a trace right pleural
 effusion.  Large hiatal hernia.  Unchanged calcifications within the left
 upper anterior chest wall, better demonstrated on the prior CT.
