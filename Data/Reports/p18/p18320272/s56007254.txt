 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ? sarcoid  // ___ year old woman with ?
 sarcoid      ___ year old woman with ? sarcoid
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
  Lung volumes are normal, unchanged since ___.  Once again there is vascular
 deficiency in the apices, right worse than left, suggesting bullae in those
 regions.  In the absence of hyperinflation or definite bullae elsewhere, I
 hesitate to suggest emphysema.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
