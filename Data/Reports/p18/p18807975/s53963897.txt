                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain, here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A vertically
 oriented linear density projecting over the left hemithorax is likely external
 to the patient.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen
 demonstrates no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
