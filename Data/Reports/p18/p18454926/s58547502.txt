                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypertension, chest pain with ST elevation,
 clean cath, c/f Takotsubo, hypoxemia  // evaluate lung volume, pulmonary
 infiltrates, edema     evaluate lung volume, pulmonary infiltrates, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.  Marked
 asymmetry in the appearance of the lungs could be due to unilateral left
 pulmonary edema.  This might be due to previous left cubitus positioning.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged.  Both pulmonary arteries are large suggesting
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pleural effusions small on the left if any. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional chest radiographs when feasible to see
 if left pulmonary edema has resolved or if there is a different explanation
 for the abnormal appearance of the left lung.
