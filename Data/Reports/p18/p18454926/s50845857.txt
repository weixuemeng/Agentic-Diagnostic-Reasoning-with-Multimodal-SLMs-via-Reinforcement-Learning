                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a 3 day history of dyspnea, concerning for CHF, crackles
 at left lung base, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographic views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. CTA chest ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a suboptimal inspiratory effort, and the low lung volumes. Allowing
 for changes due to this, there is stable at least moderate global
 cardiomegaly.  The bilateral hila are difficult to assess, but appear within
 normal limits.  There are diffuse, centrally predominant interstitial
 opacities with suggestion of interlobular septal thickening, consistent with
 pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening now moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely reflect relaxation atelectasis.  There is no focal
 lung consolidation otherwise.  There is no pneumothorax.  There bilateral
 layering small pleural effusions.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. Bilateral small layering pleural effusions.
 3. Low lung volumes.  Stable at least moderate global cardiomegaly.
