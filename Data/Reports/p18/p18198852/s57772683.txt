                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no
 overt pulmonary edema is present.  Hazy and patchy opacities in the
 retrocardiac region and right lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis
 though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  There are probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are nonspecific but
 could reflect areas of atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  Probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
