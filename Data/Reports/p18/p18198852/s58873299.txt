 HISTORY:  Status post intubation, evaluate ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 9:08 today.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm above
 the carina, any lower and repositioning would be needed.  Enteric tube is
 within the stomach.
 
 The lung volumes are exceedingly low and causes crowding of bronchovascular
 structures.  Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusion are
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable.
