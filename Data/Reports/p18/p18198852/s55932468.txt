                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bibasilar crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is further improved
 aeration of the lower lungs with some higher volumes.  Mild blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is consistent with small residual effusions or pleural
 thickening.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
