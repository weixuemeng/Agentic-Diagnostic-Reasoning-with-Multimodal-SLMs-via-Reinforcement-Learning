 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the proximal right atrium,
 unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is visualized.  Known
 nodules within both lower lobes are better depicted on the prior CT.  There is
 minimal streaky atelectasis in both lung bases.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cholecystectomy clips are
 demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.

 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Known bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules are
