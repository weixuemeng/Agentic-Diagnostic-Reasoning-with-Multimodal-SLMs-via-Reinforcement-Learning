                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in the proximal right atrium.  Heart size is
 borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Known
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not well appreciated on these views.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Two dominant left lower lobe nodules
 appear unchanged, and are better delineated on the prior CT.  Other known
 pulmonary nodules seen on CT are not well assessed on the current exam.  No
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Two left lower lobe pulmonary nodules,
 unchanged.  Known multiple other bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy are better assessed on the recent CT.
