                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Frontal scout view obtained from CT torso dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath appears unchanged, again terminating in the right
 atrium.  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs show streaky basilar opacities that are nonspecific and could be seen
 with minor atelectasis, depicted only on the frontal view.  There are most
 prominent in the retrocardiac region but are not extensive.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basilar opacities, including along bronchovascular
 structures in the retrocardiac area, which are probably compatible with
 atelectasis although early bronchopneumonia is possible.
