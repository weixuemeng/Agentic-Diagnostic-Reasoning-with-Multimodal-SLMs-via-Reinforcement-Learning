                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of aortic repair and pneumonia,
 who presents for followup evaluation of resolution of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The median sternotomy wires are normal.
 There is a small decrease in the left lung base lucency, of uncertain clinical
 relevance given the absence of prior imaging. The right lung is clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are otherwise unremarkable. The median sternotomy wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Small decrease in the left lung base lucency, which in the absence of prior
 imaging may be secondary to progressive consolidation or resolution of a
 previously seen consolidation.  If prior imaging is available, an addendum
 could be issued.
 
 No other focal consolidations suggestive of pneumonia is identified.
