                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior aortic dissection with decreased left breath sounds.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there may be mild increased opacification at the left base,
 though this is of questionable clinical significance.
 
 Extensive aortic changes and post-surgical changes are again seen.
