                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper right back pain.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  RIBS MULTIPLE VIEWS.
 
 CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
 consistent with COPD.  The heart is not enlarged, thought there is a left
 ventricular configuration.  The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded.  No
 CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 Moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 RIGHT RIBS, FOUR VIEWS:   A marker is seen on one view and overlies the
 lowermost right ribs.  A rounded wire-like density over the left upper abdomen
 appears to represent a surgical clip.  Additional sutures are seen in the left
 upper quadrant.  No displaced rib fracture or obvious lytic or sclerotic
 lesion is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Background COPD.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  
 2) No displaced rib fracture or obvious lytic or sclerotic lesion detected.  
 3) Evidence of prior surgery.
