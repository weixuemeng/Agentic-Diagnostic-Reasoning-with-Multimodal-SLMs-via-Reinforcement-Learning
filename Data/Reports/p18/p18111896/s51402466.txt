                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  OLT, to assess for volume status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in good position.  The right basilar opacification has
 substantially improved, some of which may be due to the better inspiration. 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  No definite pulmonary vascular congestion
 at this time.
