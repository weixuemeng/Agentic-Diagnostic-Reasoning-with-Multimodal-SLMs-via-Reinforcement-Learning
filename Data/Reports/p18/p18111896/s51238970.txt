                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fulminant liver failure.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in supine position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours
 earlier during the same day.  The on next previous examination identified
 bilateral patchy confluenting parenchymal infiltrates occupying practically
 both lungs equally persist and have not undergone any significant interval
 change.  Position of previously described right internal jugular approach
 central venous line as well as left-sided internal jugular approach line
 remains unchanged.  Again there is no radiographic conclusive evidence for any
 pneumothorax and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free with patient in
 supine position.  Possible pleural effusion layering posteriorly in this
 supine patient cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings for the last 10 hours interval with
 widespread confluenting parenchymal densities, most likely representing
 pulmonary edema in this patient with history of fulminant liver failure.
