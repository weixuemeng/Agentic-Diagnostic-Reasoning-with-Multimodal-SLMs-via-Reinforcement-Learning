                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of smoking now with chest pain, here to evaluate for
 pulmonary lesion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest dated ___.  Prior chest radiographs
 dated ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate symmetrically
 well-expanded and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild bi apical pleural scarring on the
 right greater than the left.  No pulmonary lesion is detected by conventional
 radiography.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No chest radiographic evidence of lung nodule, but CT would be more sensitive
 for detecting lung nodules.
