                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Sternal chest pain.  Question infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size with a left ventricular configuration.  There are vague patchy
 opacities at the lung bases, particularly on the right.  In the setting of low
 lung volumes, these are probably compatible with atelectasis.  Projecting over
 the lingular region is an additional vague opacity which is nonspecific. 
 However, it also appears streaky and may also be due to minor atelectasis. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Basiliar opacities, likely atelectasis, although evaluation is
 limited; repeat radiographs could be considered with better inspiration if
 there is clinical concern that these may reflect subtle pneumonia.
