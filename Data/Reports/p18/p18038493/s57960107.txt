                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall down ___ stairs, drunk.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 appears tortuous, but the aortic knob appears distinct.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely due to technique and low inspiratory volumes. 
 No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or large
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple bilateral displaced rib fractures are noted
 involving at least ribs 4 through 8 on the left, and rib 4 on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acutely displaced bilateral rib fractures.  Low lung volumes
 result in widening of the superior mediastinum, however if there is concern
 for injury, a CTA of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
