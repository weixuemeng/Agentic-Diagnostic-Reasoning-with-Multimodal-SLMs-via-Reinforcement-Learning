                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New oxygen requirement, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph obtained ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with predominant enlargement of the right heart, but also
 severe enlargement of the left heart appears to be unchanged.  Left
 ventricular pacer leads are demonstrated in unchanged position.  Upper lungs
 are essentially clear.  There is new right and left basal opacities most
 likely reflecting atelectasis but infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 There is also a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema is seen.
