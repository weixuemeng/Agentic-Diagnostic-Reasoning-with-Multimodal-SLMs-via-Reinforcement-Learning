                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob, ams  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:35 at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nodular opacities projecting over the bilateral lower chest bilaterally,
 symmetric, are most consistent with nipple shadows. Subtle medial right
 basilar patchy opacity likely relates to atelectasis, given that is more
 conspicuous than the prior exam earlier today, however, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, early consolidation is not excluded. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtly right basilar patchy opacity likely represents atelectasis, given short
 term development since earlier today, however in the appropriate clinical
 setting, early consolidation is not excluded.
