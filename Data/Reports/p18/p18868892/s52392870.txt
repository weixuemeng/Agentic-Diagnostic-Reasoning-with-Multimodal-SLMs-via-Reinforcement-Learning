                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath,
 chest pressure, light headedness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A right
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the cavoatrial junction/right
 atrium.  Diffuse reticulonodular opacities bilaterally are again seen,
 consistent with pulmonary metastases and extensive lymphatic invasion which
 appears slightly increased since the prior study, although this may be related
 to technique.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
