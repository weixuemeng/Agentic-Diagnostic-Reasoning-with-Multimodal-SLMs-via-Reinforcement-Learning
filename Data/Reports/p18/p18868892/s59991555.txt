  Generally stable diffuse abnormality although with slight patchy increased
  right basilar nodular opacification, question advancing malignancy,
  atelectasis or potentially superimposed infection.  Slight increased apparent
  heart size; a pericardial effusion could be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT and radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-a-Cath terminates in the right atrium.  A widespread
 interstitial abnormality with both reticular and nodular features is overall
 probably similar in severity, allowing for differences in technique, and could
 be explained based on prior CT findings by carcinomatosis and metastatic
 nodules.  There is patchy increased nodularity along the right lower lung seen
 laterally on the frontal view, the only apparent change.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart has increased somewhat in size. 
 Degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fairly stable appearance of the chest with widespread diffuse
 abnormality previously characterized as likely stemming from carcinomatosis
 and metastatic nodules.  The only change on this examination is patchy
 increased nodular opacification in the right lower lung.  Superimposed
 infection is a potential explanation for this appearance versus atelectasis or
 advancing malignancy.  The heart size is also increased somewhat, so
 potentially a pericardial effusion could be considered.
