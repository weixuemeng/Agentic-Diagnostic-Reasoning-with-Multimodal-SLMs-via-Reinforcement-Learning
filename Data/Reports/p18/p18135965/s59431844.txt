                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right pleuritic chest pain x days.  History of
 metastatic breast cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the lower SVC.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are demonstrated, the largest
 measuring up to 4 mm in the right lung base, better appreciated on the recent
 PET-CT.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Widespread
 osseous metastatic disease is again noted with compression deformities of
 several mid and lower thoracic vertebral bodies.  Partially imaged is a
 percutaneous catheter within the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. 
 Calcifications are noted within the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse osseous metastatic disease.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
