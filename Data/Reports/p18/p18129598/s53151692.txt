                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable compared to the previous
 radiograph.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Minimal opacities at the lung
 bases probably reflect atelectasis.  Remainder of lungs are clear, and there
 is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
