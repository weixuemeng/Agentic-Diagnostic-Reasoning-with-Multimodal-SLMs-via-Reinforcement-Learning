                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right mid axillary pain x 1 week s/p
 resolved URI  // R/o underlying lung pathology      R/o underlying lung
 pathology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.  Lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated.  Frontal view shows no focal pulmonary abnormality; greater
 than expected radiodensity projecting over the heart on the lateral view is
 probably a function of rotation and overlying soft tissue.  I would recommend
 a repeat lateral view, carefully positioned.  If the abnormality persists,
 oblique views should be obtained to determine if there is pneumonia or other
 pulmonary abnormality not seen on the frontal view.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 No displaced rib fracture is seen, but if there is focal tenderness in the
 chest wall, that region should be marked and rib detail views should be
 obtained.
