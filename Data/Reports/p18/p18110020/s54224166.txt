                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with developmental delay and NG tube for feeds.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There continues to be markedly severe S-shaped scoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine.  The endogastric tube courses inferiorly into the stomach
 with its sideport well below the GE junction; however, the NG tube does appear
 kinked in the segment that is just 4.5-5 cm upstream from the sideport.  The
 right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Within the limits of a severely scoliotic
 patient, the cardiac and mediastinal contours appear normal.  The lungs
 demonstrate mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube kinked within the stomach - consider minimal retraction to
 reposition.
 2.  Severe scoliosis with mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
