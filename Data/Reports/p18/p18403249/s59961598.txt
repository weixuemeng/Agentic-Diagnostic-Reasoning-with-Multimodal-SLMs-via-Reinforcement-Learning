                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is present.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
