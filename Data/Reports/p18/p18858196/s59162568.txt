                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cp  // r/o infection
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated.  A port
 projects over the left upper abdomen.  In the right upper lung there is a
 subtle opacity projecting over the right sixth posterior rib arch, likely
 overlapping os ossific structures though difficult to exclude an underlying
 nodule.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted.  Lungs otherwise
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity projecting over the right upper lung, likely overlapping
 densities though difficult to exclude a true pulmonary nodule.  Consider
 nonemergent CT to further assess.
