                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with unsuccessful right IJ placement attempt,
 assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from few hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine radiograph is presented for review, which limits
 assessment of small pneumothoraces.  Lungs are low in volume with dense
 retrocardiac opacity, which may represent extensive left lower lobar collapse
 versus consolidation accompanied by moderate pleural effusion.  Pacemaker and
 epicardial pacer are difficult to assess. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of large pneumothorax with persistent left lower lung
 opacity
