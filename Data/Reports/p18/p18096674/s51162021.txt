                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest tightness, here to evaluate for heart
 failure or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a
 left pectoral cardiac device with multiple leads in place.  A right abandoned
 lead is noted.  The inspiratory lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac
 opacification may reflect a combination of pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis but underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  The right lung
 shows no pleural effusion or focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are incompletely assessed in the setting of low lung volumes
 and massive cardiomegaly.  There is calcification at the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Retrocardiac opacification may represent a combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Massive cardiomegaly of uncertain chronicity.
