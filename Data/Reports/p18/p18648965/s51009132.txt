                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 16:50
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and fever improved with
 antibiotics, now worsening, past history of smoking, question atypical
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at 15:08.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 16:50 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs are well inflated.  On the frontal projection, there is a vague
 opacity at the right base, but this does not appear to be significantly
 different than in ___, and therefore could represent post-inflammatory
 scarring rather than an acute process.  Clinical correlation is advised and if
 the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging would be recommended.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
