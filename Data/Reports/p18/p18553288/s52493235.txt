                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall, generalized weakness, recent Hx
 supratherapeutic INR  // Rule out ICH, fracture, pneumonia, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  AP Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is minimal basilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Slight blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle may be
 due to a trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening/ atelectasis.  The
 bones are relatively osteopenic.  No obvious fracture is identified, however,
 this study has limited sensitivity for the detection of such.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle may be due to a trace
 pleural effusion versus pleural thickening/atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Left base atelectasis.
