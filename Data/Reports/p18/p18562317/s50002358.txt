                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p redosternotomy AVR  // Eval for
 infiltrate      Eval for infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes with
 increased opacification at the bases consistent with pleural effusion and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure is again seen.  Left IJ catheter again extends to the mid portion of
 the SVC.
 In the absence of a lateral view, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
