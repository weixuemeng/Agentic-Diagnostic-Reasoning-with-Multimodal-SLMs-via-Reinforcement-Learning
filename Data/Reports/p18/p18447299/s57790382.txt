                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with infected L kidney stone s/p PCN, now
 appearing septic.  // Is there e/o PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 00:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior exam there has been interval increase in the amount of
 hazy opacity in both lower lungs.  While some of this is due to volume loss,
 an early infiltrate in either lower lobe cannot be totally excluded.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular redistribution.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Left
 IJ line with tip in the mid SVC is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral lower lobe opacities could be due to volume loss versus infiltrate
