                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval postop changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The previously seen left apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
 
 Again seen is a right IJ central line - on the current study, the tip lies
 near the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are improved. Prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 similar to the prior film, with sternotomy wires again noted.
 
 There is upper zone zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Retrocardiac opacity is again seen.  Additional atelectasis at the left base
 laterally is improved.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis is present at the
 right lung base.  Equivocal minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 could be new.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Previous left apical pneumothorax no longer visualized.
 2. Improved inspiratory volumes, with some improvement of atelectasis at left
 lung base.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity.
