                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of bizarre behavior and
 elevated white blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  On the lateral view, there is very
 minimal blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle, which may be due to
 deep inspiration, pleural thickening versus a trace pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
