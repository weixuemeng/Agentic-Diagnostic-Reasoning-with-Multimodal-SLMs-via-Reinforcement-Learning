                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with T10-T11 osteomyelitis,
 assessment of the ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip ends below the
 inferior margin of the radiograph.  The left lower lobe opacity, most likely
 combination of atelectasis and potentially infectious process has
 substantially progressed since the prior study and there is redemonstration of
 the left mediastinal shift.  The patient is after recent spinal surgery due to
 osteomyelitis.
