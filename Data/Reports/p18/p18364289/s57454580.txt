 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:30 AM
  picc line terminates in upper SVC. ok to use. no right pneumothorax or
  effusion. possible small left effusion. left lung opacifications correlate
  with those better assessed on ___ CT and given  left hemidiaphragm elevation
  are likely largely related to collapse, though PNA or tumor is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 259 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with PICC line, check position.
 
 No comparison studies at this institution.  Please note that comparison to old
 films can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 AP supine chest film ___ at 259 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line is in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  On the left, there are patchy opacities
 predominantly medially which when correlated with an outside CT of ___
 likely correspond to areas of fibrosis with associated bronchiectasis.  An
 underlying mass cannot be entirely excluded.  There is minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle which suggests either chronic pleural thickening or
 small effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax, although
 the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits
 given patient's rotation on the current study.
