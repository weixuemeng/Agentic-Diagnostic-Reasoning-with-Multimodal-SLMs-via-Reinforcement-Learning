  Vague small nodular opacity in the right upper lung, suggesting very small
  focus of pneumonia in the appropriate setting; since it is somewhat nodular,
  however, follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution within eight
  weeks.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and extra lung sounds in the left lower lobe. 
 Patient has remote history of chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 There is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the right upper lung,
 suggesting a small focus of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague somewhat nodular opacity, quite small and measuring about 1
 cm in the right upper lung.  Noting demographics, morphology and patient
 presentation, this appearance is suspected to represent pneumonia, but
 followup radiographs are recommended in eight weeks in order to assure
 resolution.
