                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's soft tissues of the neck and chin obscure evaluation of the lung
 apices.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta again noted.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  Low lung
 volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
