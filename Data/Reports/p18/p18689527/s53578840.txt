                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with exertional dyspnea and history of smoking.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate prominent interstitial
 markings, most pronounced in lower lobes.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  Hilar,
 mediastinal and silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Prominent interstitial marking predominantly in the lower lobes.  In the
 setting of high clinical concern for interstitial lung disease, given
 patient's smoking history, may consider chest CT for further assessment.
