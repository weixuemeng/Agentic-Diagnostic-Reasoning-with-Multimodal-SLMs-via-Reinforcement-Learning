 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vascularity is less
 prominent.  Substantial bilateral pleural effusions are well seen on the
 lateral view.  The apparent improvement on the frontal view most likely merely
 reflects the erect position of the patient.
 Bibasilar compressive atelectatic changes are again seen.
