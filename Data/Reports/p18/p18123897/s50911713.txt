 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:22 PM
  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
  junction without evidence of pneumothorax.
  
  Enteric tube has withdrawn somewhat, with side port now in the distal
  esophagus, distal tip in the proximal stomach.  Suggested advancement so that
  the side port is well within the stomach.
  
  Subtle left perihilar and left basilar patchy opacities are nonspecific could
  be due to atelectasis or aspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated, sedated now with central line placement 
 // ? central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 17:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.9 cm above level the carina.  Enteric tube
 courses in the left upper quadrant terminating in the proximal stomach,
 however, side port appears in the distal esophagus.  There has been interval
 placement of right internal jugular venous catheter which terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Patchy left perihilar and left basilar opacities are nonspecific but
 could be due to atelectasis or aspiration.  Subcentimeter left upper lobe
 calcified nodules likely present calcified granulomas.  No pleural effusion is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
