                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  New elevated white count and sweating.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal veins are dilated, but pulmonary
 vasculature is unremarkable.  There is no edema or pleural effusion.  Lung
 volumes are low, but there is no focal pulmonary abnormality and no evidence
 of intrathoracic malignancy or infection.  I would strongly recommend
 conventional radiographs for assessment, given the technical limitations in
 imaging a patient of this size.
