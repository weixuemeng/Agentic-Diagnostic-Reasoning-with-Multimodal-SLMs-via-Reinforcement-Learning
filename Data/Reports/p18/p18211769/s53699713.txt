 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:05 PM
  Interval removal of right PICC. Increased hazy opacification at the lung bases
  bilaterally, without discrete consolidation on lateral view. New peribronchial
  cuffing with increased pulmonary vascular prominence and density in the
  fissures, likely representing fluid. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary
  edema and infection. Of note, heart size has increased compared to ___,
  suggesting fluid overload. Underlying cardiac process cannot be excluded.
  Repeat radiograph after diuresis may be helpful in distinguishing these
  processes if clinically feasible. Findings discussed with ___ by
  phone at 8 p.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Partial gastrectomy, abdominal pain, spiking fevers, evaluation
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:38 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased opacity
 at both lung bases and in the left perihilar areas.  This increase in
 radiodensity is accompanied by mild reticulations.  Simultaneously, the size
 of the cardiac silhouette has increased.  The changes could be consistent with
 both pneumonia or pulmonary edema, although the absence of other accompanying
 signs suggesting pulmonary edema make pneumonia a more likely differential
 diagnosis.
 
 No other relevant changes.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
