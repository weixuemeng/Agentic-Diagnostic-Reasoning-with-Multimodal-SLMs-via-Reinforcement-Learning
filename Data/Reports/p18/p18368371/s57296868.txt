                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Unwitnessed fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm on the frontal view, not
 substantiated on the lateral view, which could be due to atelectasis, although
 a subtle consolidation is not excluded.  No definite consolidation is seen on
 the right.  There may be some mild bilateral upper lung bronchiectasis.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal to mildly-enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No
 definite displaced fracture is seen.
