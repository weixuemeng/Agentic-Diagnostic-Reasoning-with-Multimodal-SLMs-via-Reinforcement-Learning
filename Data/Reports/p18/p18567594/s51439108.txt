                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for a consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right double lumen catheter terminates in the low SVC.  A left
 pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position.
 
 The lung volumes are low which limits assessment for pulmonary edema.  An
 opacity in the right lower lung could reflect asymmetric edema or pneumonia
 depending on the clinical setting. There is no definite pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
