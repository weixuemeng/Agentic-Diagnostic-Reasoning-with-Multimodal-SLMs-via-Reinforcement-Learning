                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Asthma, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Minimal increase
 in interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to minimal interstitial edema.
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  However, there is some evidence of pleural
 thickening along the right mid to lower hemithorax, which may have been
 present on the prior study but not clearly seen on ___ or on the CT from
 that same date.  CT performed subsequently this same date showed pleural fat. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
