                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse bilateral opacities, ? combined insterstial and
 alveolar opacities, with suggestion of faint nodular opacities in both lungs.
 No air bronchograms are identified. No effusion is seen.  Heart size is
 borderline enlarged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly more
 prominent in comparison to prior study.  
 
 Post-surgical changes are noted in the cervical spine with fusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities.  The differential diagnosis for an acute or
 subacute process includes pulmonary edema or an infectious or inflammatory
 etiology.  Given the history of fever, infeciton should be considered.
 Pulmonary edema may be somewhat less likely given the absence of effusions. If
 this were a chronic process, other etiologies would be considered.
