                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs.  There has been interval improvement in the
 right lower lung opacity, with residual linear opacity representing either
 residual pneumonia or atelectasis.  The retrocardiac opacity again could
 represent a small hiatal hernia. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the right lower lung pneumonia, with only a small
 residual right lower lung opacity.
