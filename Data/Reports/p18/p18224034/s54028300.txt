                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, abdominal tightness, rectal pressure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is new in the interval.  The aorta is tortuous
 and diffusely calcified.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present with
 small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Probable compressive atelectasis at
 the lung bases though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
