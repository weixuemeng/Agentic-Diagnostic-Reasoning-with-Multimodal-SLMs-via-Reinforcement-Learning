                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white blood cell count, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Vague opacity in the right
 lower lung could reflect developing infection without definite correlate on
 the lateral view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. Medial displacement of
 the gastric bubble suggests enlarged spleen. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Vague right lower lung opacity without correlate on lateral view
 could reflect developing infectious process. Splenomegaly.
