                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left upper-sided chest wall pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Tortuous aorta is noted as well as calcified.  Lungs
 are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Calcified
 gallstones are better appreciated on the lateral view.  Differential diagnosis
 would include tortuous splenic artery.
