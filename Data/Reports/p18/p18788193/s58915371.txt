 Study is limited as the left lung base has been excluded. Support lines and
 tubes are unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces.  There is a left retrocardiac and
 likely a left-sided pleural effusion. There is also increased density at the
 right base which may represent developing infiltrate or aspiration.
