 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ dyspnea  // evidnece of PNA or effusion     
 evidnece of PNA or effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is more coalescence of
 opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm.  This
 is consistent with volume loss in the right lower lobe, probably with
 pneumonia as suggested by the recent CT scan. Less prominent opacification at
 the left base could represent atelectasis or multifocal pneumonia.
 No evidence of cardiomegaly or appreciable vascular congestion.
