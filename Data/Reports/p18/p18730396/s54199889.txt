                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with endotracheal tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___ at 10:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip
 approximately 2.9 cm from the carina, slightly low lying.  Orogastric tube tip
 terminates in the distal esophagus and should be advanced by at least 12 cm. 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Small left pleural effusion is noted.  Streaky opacity in the left lung base
 likely reflects an area of atelectasis.  Extensive degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.  No acutely displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Slightly low lying endotracheal tube with tip approximately 2.9 cm from the
 carina.
 2. Malpositioned orogastric tube with tip in the distal esophagus.  This
 should be advanced by at least 12 cm for optimal positioning.
 3. Low lung volumes with left basilar atelectasis and small left pleural
 effusion.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
