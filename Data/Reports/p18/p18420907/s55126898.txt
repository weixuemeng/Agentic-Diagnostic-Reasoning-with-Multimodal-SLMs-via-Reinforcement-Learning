                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a mildly convex contour to
 the ascending aorta, suggesting tortuosity and perhaps ectasia.  Slight
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted.  The lungs are clear.  There
 are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominent contour of the ascending aorta, probably chronic, although CT
 could be considered to exclude acute aortic pathology in the setting of acute
 pain.  More commonly, however, findings such as this would correspond to a
 chronic abnormality associated potentially with hypertension.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
