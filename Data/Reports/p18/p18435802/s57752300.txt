                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with history of chest and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Patchy
 right base opacity likely represents prominence of vascular markings. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for better and further
 evaluation.  No large pleural effusion.  No overt pulmonary edema or evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal, likely accentuated by AP
 technique and low lung volumes.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.
