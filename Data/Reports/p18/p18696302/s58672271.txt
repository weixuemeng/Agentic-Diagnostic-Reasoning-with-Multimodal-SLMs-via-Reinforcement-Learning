                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
 rate and recent CABG.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ through ___ and CT chest
 without contrast on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient has had sternotomy for CABG in the past few weeks. The
 second from the bottom sternotomy wire is difficult to see and might be
 fractured, though not displaced, readily evaluated by physical examination of
 surgical wound.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or upper
 mediastinal widening. The extent of cardiomegaly and postoperative change are
 difficult to assess because of lordotic positioning and mediastinal fat. The
 left basal pleural interface is now obscured, perhaps another artifact of
 patient position, but particularly because the lateral view on ___ showed
 left basal atelectasis and pleural effusion, and there is mild leftward shift
 of the heart, I strongly recommend conventional ___ and Lateral views to look
 for left lower lobe collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION: Suggest conventional radiographs to assess interval enlargement of
 cardiac silhouette, and extene of left lower lobe atelectasis. D/W ___ ___
 ___ by phone at the time of approval.
