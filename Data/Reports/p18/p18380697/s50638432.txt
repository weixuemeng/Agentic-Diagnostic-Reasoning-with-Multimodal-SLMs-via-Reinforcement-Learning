  Coarsened reticular markings predominantly in the lower lungs may represent an
  atypical infection. Scattered subtle nodular opacities are also noted - also
  noted on prior CT chest. Consider nonemergent CT to further assess.
  Cardiomediastinal silhouette normal. Biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring is
  noted. Bony structures are intact.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with COPD, cough, fevers  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lungs are hyperinflated. There is
 no lobar consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Coarsened reticular markings
 with a subtle nodular component predominantly in the lower lungs may reflect
 an atypical infection. Cardiomediastinal silhouette normal. Biapical
 pleural-parenchymal scarring is noted. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Reticular nodular opacity in the lower lungs may represent atypical infection.
 Given presence of nodules on a prior CT exam, a nonemergent followup CT may be
 performed to ensure stability/ resolution of previously noted nodules.
