                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Superimposed on background nodular parenchymal architecture is more focal 1 cm
 to ___ cm nodule at the right apex not evident on the study from ___, suggesting this may be infectious or inflammatory in nature. Retrosternal
 nodular density of similar size seen on the lateral view is presumably the
 same lesion. No consolidation suggestive of pneumonia is evident and central
 pulmonary vasculature does not appear congested.  Bones appear demineralized
 but no further height loss is seen at mild wedge compression of what appears
 to be T7
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More focal nodularity in the right upper lobe superimposed on background
 nodular architecture. Its new appearance in less than 3 weeks suggests this
 may be infectious or inflammatory, however if followup radiography does not
 show this to resolve, computerized tomography the chest should be performed.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Entered into critical results dashboard after dictation at
