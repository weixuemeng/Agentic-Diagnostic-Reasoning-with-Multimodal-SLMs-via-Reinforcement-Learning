                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with coronary artery calcifications re- demonstrated. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with
 bronchial wall thickening and enlargement in the lung bases compatible with
 bronchiectasis, as seen previously.  Patchy ill-defined opacities in the lung
 bases as well as within both upper lobes are largely unchanged compared to the
 previous radiograph.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change since the previous examination. 
 Bronchiectasis, most pronounced in the lung bases, with multifocal patchy
 airspace opacities which could reflect chronic endobronchial
 infection/multifocal pneumonia.  No new focal consolidation otherwise
 demonstrated.
