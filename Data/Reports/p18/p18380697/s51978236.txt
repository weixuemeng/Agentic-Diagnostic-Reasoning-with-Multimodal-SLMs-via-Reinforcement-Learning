                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and right-sided chest pain, to assess for pneumonia or rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again biapical
 scarring and calcifications, consistent with old tuberculous disease. 
 Generalized interstitial prominence raises the possibility of interstitial
 lung disease, for which HRCT of the chest could be obtained.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Mild wedging of an upper-to-mid dorsal
 vertebra is again seen.
