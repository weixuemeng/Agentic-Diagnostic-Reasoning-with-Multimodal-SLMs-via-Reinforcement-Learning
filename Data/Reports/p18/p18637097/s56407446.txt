                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Evaluation for pneumonia.  Transplant patient on tacrolimus.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior images are available for comparison at this time.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate a nodular opacity in the right
 midlung and a hazy opacity in the left lung base posteriorly, both possibly
 reflecting an infectious etiology in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and demonstrate no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Multiple mild toracic vertebral body compression deformities
 are present and are of indeterminate age, correlation with prior imaging is
 recommended when available.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacities in the right mid lung and posterior left lower lobe could represent
 multi-focal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Followup PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended after treatment to evaluate for
 resolution, for possible underlying pulmonary lesion.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:40, at 5
 min after discovery was made.
