                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant and splenectomy, presenting with
 headache and productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 has been interval removal of a right PICC and nasogastric tube.  As seen on
 the prior study from ___, there is a widespread bilateral
 interstitial abnormality, more prominent in the lower lungs, likely chronic in
 nature, although mild interstitial pulmonary edema could have a similar
 appearance.  There is no focal consolidation.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions. No
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is re-demonstration of multilevel
 vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, not significantly changed in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiac or pulmonary process.  Bilateral
 predominantly lower lung interstitial opacities are most likely chronic in
 nature, although mild interstitial pulmonary edema could have a similar
 appearance.
