                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with mental status changes.  Please
 evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA & LATERAL CHEST FILMS:  Lungs show evidence of hyperinflation, and
 bibasilar atelectasis. Calcification over the left hilum is once again seen.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The aorta appears tortuous. 
 Degenerative changes are again seen in the spine, however, no compression
 fractures are identified.  There are no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. The calcific density projecting
 over the left hilum can again be evaluated as per recommendations of prior
 study including shallow oblique radiographs or comparison with prior
 radiographs to assess for long term stability of this finding.
