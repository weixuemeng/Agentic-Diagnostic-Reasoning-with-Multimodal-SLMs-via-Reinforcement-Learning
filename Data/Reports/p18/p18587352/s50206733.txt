                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with decreased breath sounds on the left.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral densities projecting over the breasts are likely
 nipple shadows.  There is however a calcific density projecting over the left
 hilum which is of nonspecific etiology. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise normal.  The aorta appears tortuous.  Degenerative changes are
 visualized throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. There is however a calcific
 density projecting over the left hilum which is of non-specific etiology.
 Further evaluation is recommended with shallow oblique radiographs.
 Alternatively, submission of prior radiographs for long-term assessment may be
 performed.
