                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 HISTORY:  Possible pathologic calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Oblique views of the chest were obtained to assess possible
 pathologic calcifications projecting over the left hilus, conceivably a
 calcified mediastinal cyst or saccular aortic aneurysm.  Oblique views fail to
 confirm that any such calcification.  I do not believe there is an indication
 for further followup.
