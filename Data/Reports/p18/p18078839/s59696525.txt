                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATIONS:  Assess volume overload, patient with end-stage renal disease.
 
 COMPARISON : ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially, including the most
 severe opacification, in the right lower lobe, more likely due to a
 combination and atelectasis than pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are
 likely, but difficult to assess with the patient supine.  Progression of
 chronic moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be due to
 worsening cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Mild pulmonary edema improving.  Chronic cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion increased.
