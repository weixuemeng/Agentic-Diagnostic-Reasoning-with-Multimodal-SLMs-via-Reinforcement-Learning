                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with resolving pulmonary edema.
 
 Evaluate for cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is again seen cardiomegaly which is stable.  It is difficult
 to comment on pericardial effusion versus baseline cardiomegaly on
 radiographs. If there is high concern, recommend ultrasound or CT scan.  The
 lungs are grossly clear.  There has been resolution of the pulmonary edema
 since the previous study.  There are no pneumothoraces or large pleural
 effusions.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over the GE junction.
