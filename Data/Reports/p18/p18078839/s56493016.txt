                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and concern for congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse alveolar and interstitial
 opacities compatible with pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities, right greater
 than left, are likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 However, consolidative pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax
 is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Clips are visualized in the region of the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with moderate pulmonary
 edema.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflecting pleural effusions and atelectasis,
 right greater than left.  However, pneumonia is also within the differential
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
