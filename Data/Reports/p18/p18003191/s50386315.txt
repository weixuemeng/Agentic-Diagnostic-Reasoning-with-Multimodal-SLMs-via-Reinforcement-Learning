                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with AMS  // eval ? PNA, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are noted.  Additional increased
 opacity projects over the lung bases posteriorly on the lateral view without
 clear correlate on the frontal view and likely in part due to atelectasis. 
 Posterior costophrenic angles are not clearly delineating raising possibility
 of small effusions.  Mild cardiac enlargement is noted.  Tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  IVC filter is
 visualized on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Increased opacity at the lung bases on the lateral view only, potentially due
 to atelectasis.  Small pleural effusions are possible.
