                                 FINAL REPORT

 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Diffuse global enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated with
 predominantly enlarged left ventricle and right ventricle as well as both

 pneumothorax is seen.

 Global cardiomegaly, correlation with previous history and echocardiography is
 recommended.
