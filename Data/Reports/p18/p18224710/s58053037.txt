                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with IABP  // assess balloon pump location     
 assess balloon pump location
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The tip of the IABP is 3.2 cm below the transverse arch
 of the aorta.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  Minimal
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Left basilar opacification with obscuration of the
 cardiophrenic angle is consistent with small effusion and mild atelectatic
 changes at the left base.
