                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  The streak of atelectasis at the right base is less dense.  The
 posterior aspect of one of the hemidiaphragms again is not as sharply seen,
 most likely reflecting some atelectatic change.  Mild haziness at the left
 base could reflect some pleural fluid.
