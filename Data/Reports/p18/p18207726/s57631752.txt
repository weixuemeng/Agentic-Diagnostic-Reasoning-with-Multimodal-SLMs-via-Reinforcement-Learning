                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative elevation of white count.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dense relatively linear opacification at the right base
 that most likely represents post-operative atelectasis.  On the lateral view,
 there is poor definition of the posterior aspect of one of the hemidiaphragms.
 This probably reflects some pleural fluid and atelectasis at the left base.
 
 If there is a clinical symptomatology suggestive of infection, pneumonia would
 have to be seriously considered.
 
 Of incidental note is a cervical fusion device.
