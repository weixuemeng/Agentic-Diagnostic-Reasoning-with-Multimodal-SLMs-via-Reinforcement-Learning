                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx IVDU, seizures intubated for RF, severe
 sepsis unclear etiology  // interval change?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated with the ET tube in situ with its tip 70 mm proximal
 to the carina.  Nasogastric tube projects over the esophagus and courses out
 of sight inferiorly.  Right-sided IJV catheter in situ with the tip in the
 proximal SVC.  The left upper lobe mass is again identified with mediastinal
 shift to the right.
 There has been new development of opacification of the left lower lobe with
 minimal residual aeration in the inferior aspect of the left lower lobe.
 The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a new opacification of the left lower lobe, and I get the impression
 of volume gain suggesting airspace consolidation rather than atelectasis.
