                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, rule out lung lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, which could be caused by a lesser inspiratory effort of the
 patient.  As a consequence, the right lung bases and the size of the cardiac
 silhouette appear slightly denser and bigger, respectively, than on the
 previous examination.  No pulmonary edema.  No acute lung abnormality. 
 Unchanged mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Left pectoral pacemaker in
 unchanged position.  The pacemaker leads are also constant.
