                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable supine chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ lady with h/o CML s/p allogenic MRD (d0 = ___) admitted
 with AMS, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and shock now s/p cardiac
 catheterization without CAD but remains in cardiogenic shock of unclear
 etiology on IABP. Dampened tracing.  // Evaluate IABP position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and relatively unchanged from
 most recent same-day study.  With change in positioning from previous study
 the right lower lobe opacity appears to have improved with with an unchanged
 left lower lobe opacity raising the concern that all these findings are
 related to improving pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia cannot
 be completely excluded given the current clinical picture.
 
 The intra aortic balloon pump is unchanged from most recent study in the
 distal thoracic aorta.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is unchanged and well
 positioned.  The ETT is seen and terminates in the mid trachea.  Nasogastric
 tube is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of right lower lobe opacity and stable left lower lobe
 opacity raising concern for findings related to improving pulmonary edema
 though superimposed pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
 2. Intra-aortic balloon pump terminates in the lower thoracic aorta with
 well-positioned Swan-Ganz catheter.  Stable mild pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:42 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
