                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable semi-upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia, cardiogenic shock  // interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and relatively unchanged.  There
 is an intra-aortic balloon pump with the tip terminating in the lower thoracic
 aorta approximately 11 cm distal from the aortic knob.  The Swan-___ catheter
 appears to be in good position.  Nasogastric tube is also seen and in
 unchanged position.  The mild pulmonary edema appears stable when compared
 with most recent study with Previous right lower lobe opacity and decreased
 left lower lobe opacity which could represent superimposed pneumonia however
 the chronicity of changes is abnormal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of left lower lobe opacity and worsening of right
 lower lobe opacity raising concern for superimposed pneumonia on top of stable
 mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Intra-aortic balloon pump terminates in the lower thoracic aorta with
 well-positioned Swan-Ganz catheter.
 3. Stable mild pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
