 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Left flank pain, on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Vague
 heterogeneous bilateral opacities are noted throughout each lung, which are
 superimposed on a small preexisting lung nodule, suggesting calcified
 granulomas.  However, there may be additional nodules including a nodular
 focus measuring about 8 mm in diameter that projects over the left
 mid-to-upper lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague but widespread parenchymal opacities, including at least a
 few possible nodules.  If an etiology is suspected clinically, such as
 pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia, then followup radiographs are suggested
 after treatment to show resolution of all opacities back to baseline. 
 Otherwise, chest CT could be considered.
