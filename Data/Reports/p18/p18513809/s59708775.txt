                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and left-sided chest pain. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___, and CT
 chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Redemonstrated are several chronic, left, lateral rib fractures, originally
 identified in ___ via CT examination, and better evaluated on the
 dedicated rib series performed on ___.  Additionally, there are
 wedge-shaped compression deformities of at least 2 thoracic vertebral bodies,
 one of which is new since the prior chest radiograph dated ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Multiple chronic left rib fractures, better characterized on the
 concomitant dedicated rib series, and originally identified on the prior chest
 CT.  Acute on chronic fractures cannot be completely excluded.  
 
 2.  Two thoracic vertebral body wedge shaped compression deformities, one new
 since the prior examination.
