 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, to assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable, with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There
 is a mild increase in the moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with
 decreased aeration of the right lower lobe.  Heterogeneous opacification in
 the retrocardiac left lung base, likely represents atelectasis.  No new
 consolidation is detected.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in the right pleural effusion and right basal
 atelectasis.  Stable left basal atelectasis.
