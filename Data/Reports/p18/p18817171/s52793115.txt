                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after pericardiocentesis
 with persistent cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval increase in bilateral
 pleural effusions or potentially this is reflecting the upper position as
 opposite to supine on the prior imaging.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette
 is difficult since it obscured by bilateral effusion.  No pericardial drain is
 currently seen:  Disconnected?  Upper lungs are essentially clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
