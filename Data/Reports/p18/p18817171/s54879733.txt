                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the recent chest radiograph performed one day
 prior, there is no significant change.  Again noted are bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the right than the left, with associated atelectasis. 
 There is no evidence of consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax.  The shape of
 the trachea suggests COPD.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged, which is due to the known pericardial effusion.  There is
 no change in the heart size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate-sized pleural effusions, larger on the right than the
 left, with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  No new infiltrate or edema.
 3.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly from known pericardial effusion.
