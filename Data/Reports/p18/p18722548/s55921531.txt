 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with HIV, PML, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is a right lung opacity
 seen laterally, new from prior.  Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. 
 Please note that lateral view is limited due to patient's arms being down by
 his side.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased region of opacity at the right lung base laterally,
 which could be due to infection in the proper clinical setting.
