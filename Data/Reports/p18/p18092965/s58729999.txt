                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumothorax- now clamped chest tube. 
 Please evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  06:00 on the same morning
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 If there is a residual pneumothorax, it is very small.  Endobronchial stents
 are unchanged in position, as is the right apical pleural catheter.  Remainder
 the lungs are clear but hyperinflated.  No pleural effusion.  Fullness of the
 right hilum is consistent with lymphadenopathy and known right apical nodule
 is seen to better detail on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant residual pneumothorax.
