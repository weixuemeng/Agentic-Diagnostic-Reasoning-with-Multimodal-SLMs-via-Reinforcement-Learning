                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with endocarditis and
 suspected septic emboli.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to chest
 CT from ___.
 
 The known scoliosis, right aortic arch and descending aorta are redemonstrated
 as well as childhood median sternotomy wires.  Lungs are currently clear with
 no abnormalities seen, but the ground-glass opacities and small nodules seen
 on the prior CT chest are potentially below the resolution of the chest
 radiograph, that if clinically warranted correlation with chest CT might be
 considered.  There is no pleural effusion.  The left PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC.
