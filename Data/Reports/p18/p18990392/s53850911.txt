                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Clot in dialysis fistula.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and more recent chest
 CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The metallic pattern along the mid portion of a left
 brachiocephalic and subclavian stent shows irregularity along the mid portion
 of the stent where it crosses over the left first rib.  This is probably due
 to an impression on the stent by the rib, but appears new since the prior CT,
 which was performed very shortly after placement.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is similar mild
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Irregularity of
 stent where it crosses the first rib; although the stent does not appear
 collapsed, consultation with the interventional radiology service is suggested
 when clinically appropriate regarding the finding.
