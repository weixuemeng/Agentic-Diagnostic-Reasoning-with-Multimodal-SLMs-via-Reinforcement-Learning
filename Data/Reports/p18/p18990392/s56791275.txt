                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, hx of ESRD on HD
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  A subclavian stent is
 again seen now with extension into the left axillary vein.  Lung volumes are
 low and the patient's chin obscures the superior mediastinum and lung apices.
 Allowing for these limitations, there is at least moderate pulmonary edema
 with bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions.  Difficult to exclude a
 lower lung pneumonia.  No large pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
