                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, concerning for chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is a nodular opacity projecting over the
 right lower lung field for which further evaluation with oblique radiographs
 or CT is recommended.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The left
 lung is clear.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung
 field for which further evaluation with oblique chest radiograph or CT is
 recommended.  Hyperinflated lungs suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.
