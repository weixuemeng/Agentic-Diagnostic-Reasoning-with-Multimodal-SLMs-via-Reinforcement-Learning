 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Status post esophagectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  The air inclusions
 in the soft tissues are minimally decreasing.  Unchanged mild mediastinal
 widening and moderate cardiomegaly, a part of which can be explained by the
 reducing lung volumes.  No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.
