                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough for three days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 moderate right and small left bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities may most likely relate to atelectasis and
 pleural effusion, although superimposed consolidation is not excluded. 
 Additionally, in the lateral right upper lobe, there is additional site of
 consolidation, which may be due to additional site of infection.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body, similar in appearance as
 compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities may represent combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation due to
 infection and/or aspiration not excluded.  Additional site of lateral right
 upper lung opacity may represent additional site of infection.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
