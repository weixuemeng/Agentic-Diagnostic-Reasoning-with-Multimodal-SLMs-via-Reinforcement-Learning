                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, headstrike, right chest injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aortic knob demonstrates atherosclerotic
 calcifications. Known small right hemopneumothorax is re- demonstrated, better
 assessed on the prior chest CT. There is no leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle also suggests a
 tiny left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated along with
 probable small areas of contusion in the right lung base. Pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged. Fractures of the right fifth through ninth ribs
 are re- demonstrated, several which are comminuted and displaced. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is seen within the right lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comminuted and displaced right fifth through ninth rib fractures with
 associated subcutaneous emphysema and small right hemopneumothorax, better
 assessed on the previous chest CT. Bibasilar atelectasis and small areas of
 contusion within the right lung base.
