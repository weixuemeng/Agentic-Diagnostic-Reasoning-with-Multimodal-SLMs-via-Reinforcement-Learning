                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post aortic repair.  Evaluation for effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Post-repair appearance of the upper mediastinum appears stable over multiple
 prior postoperative radiographs. Graft material and skin ___ are unchanged
 in position.  The endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and mediastinal drain
 are unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax. A persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms is unchanged since the prior
 examinations, reflecting atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot
 be excluded.  No pleural effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No effusions.
 2. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.
