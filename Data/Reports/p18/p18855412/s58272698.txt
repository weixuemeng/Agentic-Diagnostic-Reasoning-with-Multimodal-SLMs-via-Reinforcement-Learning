                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // ?pNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle. The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged. The aorta is
 tortuous.  Chronic interstitial opacities are again demonstrated, most
 pronounced within the upper lobes, left greater than right.  Patchy opacities
 within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though regions of
 developing infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial abnormality with upper lobe predominance, most pronounced
 within the left upper lobe, which on the prior chest CT was suggestive of
 either sarcoidosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or NSIP.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration are not excluded.
