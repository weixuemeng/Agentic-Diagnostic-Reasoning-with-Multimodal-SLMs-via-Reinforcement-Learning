 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:24 PM
  Endotracheal tube tip in standard position. Orogastric tube tip is seen to the
  level of the gastroesophageal junction, but not clearly seen below the
  diaphragm. Consider dedicated AP view of the abdomen for further assessment of
  the tip of the orogastric tube. Mild pulmonary edema, worse compared to 11:03
  today. Patchy opacities in the lung upper lobes, more pronounced on the left,
  may reflect areas of infection or aspiration.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:34 and 11:03
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation. An endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 3.6 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is seen
 coursing inferiorly below the diaphragm though the tip is not well seen. 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided AICD/ pacemaker
 device is noted with single lead terminating in the region of the right
 ventricle. Heart is moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.
 The aorta remains tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema, which has
 progressed since ___:03 today. More focal ill-defined opacities within the
 upper lobes bilaterally, greater on the left, may reflect areas of aspiration
 or infection. No pneumothorax is identified, and no pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip in standard position. Orogastric tube courses below
 the diaphragm. While the tip is not well seen, it is likely within the
 stomach.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema, worse compared to 11:03 today.
 3. Patchy opacities in the lung upper lobes, more pronounced on the left, may
 reflect areas of infection or aspiration.
