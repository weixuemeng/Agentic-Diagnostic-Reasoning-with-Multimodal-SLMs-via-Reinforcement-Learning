                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain status post bag of cement falling onto chest,
 question ribs or sternum fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The mid sternum is fractured and displaced by 10 mm with the superior sternum
 located posterior to the inferior sternum.  There continues to be blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle posteriorly, which appears to be from chronic
 pleural thickening.  There continues to be a hazy retrocardiac opacity, which
 may be attributable to atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New mid-sternal fracture with 10 mm of distraction.
 2. No definite rib fracture or pneumothorax.
 3. Retrocardiac patchy opacity which may be attributed to atelectasis.
