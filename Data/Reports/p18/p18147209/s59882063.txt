                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and CT from that same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is again moderate relative
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Streaky associated opacities are most
 likely due to associated atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with patchy
 opacities probably due to atelectasis.  No definite evidence of acute disease.
