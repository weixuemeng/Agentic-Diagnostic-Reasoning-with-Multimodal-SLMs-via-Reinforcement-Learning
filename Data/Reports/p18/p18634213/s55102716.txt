                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath for three days
 ago, now with productive cough and fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral perihilar and bibasilar airspace opacities
 suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary edema as well as small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Lung volumes
 are low.  At least 2 calcified nodular opacities are seen within the left
 upper lobe, the largest measuring 1.5 cm, possibly granulomas. A tiny dense
 nodular opacity in the right lung apex may also reflect a granuloma. Bones
 appear to be intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral small pleural effusions and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Multiple calcified nodular opacities within the upper lobes, likely
 granulomas.
