                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is mild
 scarring at each lung apex, not significantly changed. There are no pleural
 effusions. In the setting of prior pleural effusion and atelectasis at the
 left lung base, patchy residual opacities are most likely due to chronic
 residual scarring. Elsewhere the lungs appear clear. Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
