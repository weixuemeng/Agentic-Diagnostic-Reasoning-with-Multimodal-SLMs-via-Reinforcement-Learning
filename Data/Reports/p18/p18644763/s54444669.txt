 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions which are stable in size.  Effusions are

 mid-to-upper lung fields appear clear without pneumothoraces or focal
 consolidation.  The mediastinum is not widened.
