                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dementia and recent gallstone pancreatitis. 
 Now with cough and a white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 11:16 p.m.:
 
 There is at least some bibasilar atelectasis.  Whether there is also
 pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate, and the delineation would be
 helped considerably by conventional radiographs if feasible.  Heart remains
 mildly to moderately enlarged, but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.
 Right PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  Small left
 pleural effusion is presumed.  There is no right pleural effusion or
 indication of pneumothorax.
