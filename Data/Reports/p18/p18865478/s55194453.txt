                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Repositioned right PICC, here to evaluate PICC positioning. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 08:57. 
 
 Technique:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the most recent prior study, the right PICC has been retracted
 with the tip still terminating in the proximal right atrium, which should be
 retracted 3-3.5 cm to place in the low SVC.  The appearance of the chest is
 otherwise unchanged.  The lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small right pleural effusion is
 suggested.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent but unchanged with mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right PICC with tip in proximal right atrium and could be retracted 3-3.5 cm
 to place in the low SVC. 
 
 Possible small right pleural effusion.
