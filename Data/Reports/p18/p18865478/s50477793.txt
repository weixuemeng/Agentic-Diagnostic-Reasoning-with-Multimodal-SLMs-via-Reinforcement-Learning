                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with CVA, here with GI bleeding, new ET tube, evaluation
 for tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New ET tube ends 4.7 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach and
 right-sided PICC line ends in mid SVC.  New surgical clips in the midline were
 probably for the GI bleeding.  The heart, moderate enlargement is unchanged. 
 The right hilum is prominent, unchanged since ___.  It is impossible to
 differentiate between dilation of normal vascular structure or even hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Prominent right hilar region could either be dilated vascular structure or
 even lymphadenopathy.
