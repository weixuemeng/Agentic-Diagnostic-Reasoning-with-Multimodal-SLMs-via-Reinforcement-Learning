                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stent in BI  // r/o RLL collapse
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, bilateral pigtail pleural
 catheters have apparently changed in position, even allowing for differences
 in patient rotation between the exams.  Moderate right pleural effusion has
 increased in size in the interval and mild pulmonary edema has worsened in the
 interval.  Right lower lobe remains collapsed, likely secondary to an
 obstructing lesion demonstrated on prior outside CT of ___.  A
 nonspecific heterogeneous opacity at the left base has worsened in the
 interval.  No other relevant change.
