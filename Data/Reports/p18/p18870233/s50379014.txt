                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of asthma with recent asthma exacerbation, here to evaluate
 for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and ___. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms. 
 There is peribronchial cuffing compatible with the patient's known history of
 small airways disease.  Subtle increased opacification overlying the lower
 thoracic spine on the lateral view compared to prior studies may represent an
 early basilar pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Calcification
 of the aortic knob is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible early basilar pneumonia, seen only the lateral view.  Short interval
 followup with repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs with improved
 inspiratory level could be considered for further evaluation.  
 
 Findings were posted by Dr. ___ to the radiology critical results dashboard
 for communication to the ordering physician ___ ___:56am on ___.
