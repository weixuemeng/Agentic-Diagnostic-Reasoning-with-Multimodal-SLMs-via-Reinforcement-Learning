                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute on chronic heart failure and
 progressive renal failure about to start HD  // Eval for interval change in
 pulmonary edema after diuresis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent study of 2 days earlier, widespread bilateral airspace
 opacities have substantially improved, likely due to improving pulmonary
 edema, although the nodular configuration of some of the opacities raises the
 possibility of coexisting infection, including fungal organisms and septic
 emboli.
