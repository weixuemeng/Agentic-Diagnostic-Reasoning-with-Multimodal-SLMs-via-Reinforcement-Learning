                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath evaluate for CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Bilateral hila are not well seen.  Diffuse bilateral nodular
 appearing airspace opacities likely represent pulmonary edema, however this
 appearance is nonspecific and differential includes alveolar hemorrhage in
 addition to disseminated Wegener's or multifocal infection, possibly septic
 emboli.  Difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Likely severe pulmonary edema.  However given nodular appearance, if
 patient does not respond to diuresis, consider alternative etiology such as
 Wegener's or multifocal infection, as above.
 2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
