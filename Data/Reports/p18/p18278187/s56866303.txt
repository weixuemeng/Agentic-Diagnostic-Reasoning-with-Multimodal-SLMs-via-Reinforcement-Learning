                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with subjective fevers/chills  // Please eval for any pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well expanded and grossly clear. There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation.  The
 heart is normal in size. The thoracic aorta is tortuous, and deviates the
 trachea to the right.
 
 Previously described bilateral pulmonary nodules, calcified infrahilar right
 lymph node, and multiple fractures including many mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies and posterior lateral right ribs are unchanged, and better
 characterized on prior CT. Chronic deformity of the proximal right humerus
 suggests prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
