                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild prominence of
 the hila which may be due to low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
