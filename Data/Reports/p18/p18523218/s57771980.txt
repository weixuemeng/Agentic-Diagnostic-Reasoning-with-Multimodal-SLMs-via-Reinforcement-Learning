                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, unresponsive.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube tip is
 approximately 3.5 cm from the carina, in appropriate position.  Enteric tube
 tip is seen within the stomach, although the side port is likely at the GE
 junction.  There are bilateral mid-to-lower lung parenchymal opacities.  There
 is more focal consolidation in the right upper lung, suggesting overlying
 fibrotic changes, likely chronic.  There is also a 6-mm nodule projecting over
 the left posterior fifth rib.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Prominence of the mediastinum may be due to position and tortuosity of the
 vessels.  There is suggestion of bilateral effusions given blunting of the
 costophrenic angles.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, potentially due to edema or
 bilateral infection.   Nodular opacity projecting over the left posterior
 fifth rib, potentially within bone such as rib or scapula, although underlying
 pulmonary nodule is possible.  Probable bilateral effusions.  Nasogastric tube
 should be advanced for more optimal positioning.
