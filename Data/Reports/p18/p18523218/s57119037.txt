                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___ WITH COMPARISON RADIOGRAPH OF ONE DAY
 EARLIER
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. 
 Widespread bilateral alveolar opacities have progressed in the interval,
 particularly within the left lung.  This most likely represents a rapidly
 progressive pneumonia, but secondary process within the left lung such as
 asymmetrical edema or aspiration are additional considerations. 
 Moderate-sized left pleural effusion appears increased from the recent
 radiograph, but positional differences may in part contribute to this apparent
 change.  There is also likely a small right pleural effusion present, with no
 pneumothorax evident.
