                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right jugular central
 catheter with the tip in the low SVC, and a nasogastric tube which extends at
 least into the stomach.  The right pneumothorax now has a subpulmonic
 component, and appears slightly larger, although this may simply be due to
 changes in positioning.  A moderate left pleural effusion, left lower lobe
 consolidation, and cardiomegaly are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. The right pneumothorax now has a subpulmonic component and appears slightly
 larger, although this may be simply due to changes in positioning.  
 
 2. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including a moderate left pleural
 effusion, left lower lobe opacity, and cardiomegaly.
