                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 the ET tube, NG tube, right IJ line are in unchanged.  The pigtail chest tube
 is more medially positioned.  Lucency at the base suggests a small
 pneumothorax but the margins of the lung are difficult to visualize.  The
 alveolar infiltrate on the left is improved.  There continues to be dense
 retrocardiac opacity consistent volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  There are
 scattered areas of patchy alveolar infiltrate in the right mid lung and
 scarring in the right upper lung.
