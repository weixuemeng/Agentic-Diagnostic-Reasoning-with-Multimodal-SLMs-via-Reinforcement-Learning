                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___ AT 6:07 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with respiratory failure with right IJ placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from earlier the same day at 4:42 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube is in stable
 position as is the NG tube which can be advanced for optimal positioning given
 side port within the distal esophagus.  There is new right IJ central venous
 catheter whose tip is likely in the upper right atrium and should be withdrawn
 3-4 cm for a more optimal positioning.  There is no visualized pneumothorax. 
 Remainder of the exam is unchanged, notable for probable bilateral effusions
 and bilateral parenchymal opacities potentially due to edema versus bilateral
 infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right IJ line likely in the upper right atrium and should be
 retracted 3-4 cm for optimal positioning.  NG tube which can be advanced for
 optimal positioning given side port within the distal esophagus.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 9:20 p.m. on
 ___.
