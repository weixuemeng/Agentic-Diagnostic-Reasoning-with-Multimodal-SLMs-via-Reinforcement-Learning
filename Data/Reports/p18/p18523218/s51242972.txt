                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post respiratory arrest.  Evaluate for interval change in
 pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right jugular central
 catheter with the tip in the low SVC, an endotracheal tube in proper position,
 and a nasogastric tube with the tip in the stomach.  There is increased
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated, the left
 increased compared to prior radiograph.  There is also bibasilar atelectasis
 left greater than right.  Superimposed developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Additionally, there is a small to moderate right pneumothorax. 
 This pneumothorax is not seen on the prior study secondary to pleural effusion
 surrounding the upper lobe, but is now evident.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small to moderate right pneumothorax. 
 
 2.  Increased pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than
 right.  Superimposed developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  
 
 3.  Redemonstration of bilateral pleural effusions, the left increased
 compared to prior radiograph.  
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
