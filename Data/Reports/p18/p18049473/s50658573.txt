                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever. Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is
 increased opacification of the left mid to lower lung suggesting pneumonia
 with the greatest suspected degree of involvement in the superior segment of
 the left lower lobe. There is a similar mild interstitial abnormality
 involving both lungs which alternatively suggests mild pulmonary edema. There
 is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Sclerotic bones suggest renal
 osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Findings suggesting pneumonia in the left lung with the greatest degree of
 suspected involvement in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
 
 2.  Persistent mild interstitial abnormality suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
