 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // r/o Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities which may be due to severe
 pulmonary edema or infection.  More confluent opacity in left mid lung raises
 concern for consolidation due to infection.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities raise concern for severe pulmonary
 edema.  Underlying infection, particularly in the left mid lung, not excluded.
