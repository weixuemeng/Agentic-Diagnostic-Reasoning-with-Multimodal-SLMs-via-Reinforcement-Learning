 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS: None.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 slight blurring of the left cardiac border on the frontal view but suspected
 to represent a pericardial fat pad.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal degenerative changes are noted along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
