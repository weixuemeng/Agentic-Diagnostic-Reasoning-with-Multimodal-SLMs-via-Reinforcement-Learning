                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  No prior dedicated chest radiography or CT imaging available. 
 I-131 scan from ___ included CT images of the chest obtained for
 SPECT-CT imaging.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, portable AP upright. 
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable aside from vague fullness of the right
 superior mediastinum which probably reflects a known right suprahilar nodule. 
 Throughout each lung, multiple nodules of medium size are noted that are
 consistent with known metastatic disease.  Streaky left basilar opacity
 suggests minor atelectasis in the lingula.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple nodules suggesting metastatic disease, difficult to
 compare directly to the prior study, but compatible with prior findings.
