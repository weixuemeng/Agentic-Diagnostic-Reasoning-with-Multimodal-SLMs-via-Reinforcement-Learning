                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest tube, ett  // ? ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is seen 2.3 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen
 terminating below the field of view. A left internal jugular catheter
 terminates at the origin of the SVC.  A left and right chest tube are
 unchanged.
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not
 significantly changed. Bilateral perihilar and parenchymal opacities are
 minimally increased from the prior study and suggest minimally worsened
 pulmonary edema. There is persistent opacity at the left base likely related
 to atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumothorax. Minimally increased perihilar and bilateral
 parenchymal opacities are consistent with minimally worsened pulmonary edema. 
 Left basal atelectasis. No other significant change.
