  Decreased lung volumes with increased retrocardiac density which has increased
  since yesterday but had previously decreased, possibly representing

  pleural effusion. Discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 11:20 p.m. on

 and support devices are constant. Bilateral parenchymal opacities at the lung
 bases. The patient has received a right chest tube. The side all is not

 placed left tube is in unchanged position.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.
 Ongoing signs indicative of mild right upper lobe atelectasis.
