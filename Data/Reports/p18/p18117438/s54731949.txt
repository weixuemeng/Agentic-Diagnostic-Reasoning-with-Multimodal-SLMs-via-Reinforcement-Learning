                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for
 a left-sided chest tube with side port lateral to the left lateral rib margins
 overlying the left scapula.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits for technique.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with relative
 sparing of the periphery of the right upper lobe shows slight interval
 improvement, particularly at the lung bases with improved visualization of
 both hemidiaphragms.  Bilateral pleural effusions also appear slightly better.
 No visible pneumothorax.  Known fractures have been more fully detailed on
 previous CT exam.
