                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p MVC vs wall, GCS 3 at scene, b/l chest tubes in bay,
 +FAST, s/p ex-lap and splenectomy. Occipital condyle Fx, Pelvic Fx, Multiple
 spinous process fx, L ___ rib fx  // eval for position of ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is 2 cm above the carina. Left subclavian line tip is in the SVC.
 Left-sided chest tube. Projects over the mid spine and is still too far
 medial. Right chest tube has the side port in the subcutaneous tissues of the
 chest and has likely been pulled back 2 4R there is a right upper lobe area of
 volume loss/alveolar infiltrate. There is a left lower lobe lateral infiltrate
 as well. It is difficult to assess for pneumothorax on this film but given the
 lucency in the right lower lung there is likely a small inferior pneumothorax
 on the right
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right inferior pneumothorax with chest tube with proximal port in the soft
 tissues. Left chest tube is very medially placed
