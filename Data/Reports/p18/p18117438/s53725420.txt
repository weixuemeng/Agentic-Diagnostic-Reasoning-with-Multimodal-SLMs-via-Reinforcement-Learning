                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of motor vehicle accident status post splenectomy and
 compressive craniectomy for cerebral edema.  Please evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently from
 ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this
 film.  Left-sided subclavian line terminates at the upper SVC.  The ET tube is
 relatively low, approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.  The left-sided PIC
 line terminates at the left axillary vein, unchanged in position compared to
 the prior exam.  
 
 Right perihilar opacities are unchanged, however there has been an interval
 increase in the left perihilar opacities, which may be secondary to pneumonia
 or atelectasis. Left sided pneumomediastinum is new. There is no large pleural
 effusion.
 
 The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New pneumomediastinum. This could be secondary to barotrauma, however
 airway/esophageal trauma should also be trauma.
  
 2.  Stable right perihilar opacity. Interval increase in left perihilar
 opacity, compared to the prior exam. This could be secondary to worsening
 atelectasis, or pneumonia.
 
 3.  ET tube is slightly low, measuring approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.
 
 These findings were initially discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by
 phone at ___:___ a.m. on the day of the exam, and subsequently with Dr. ___ at
 1:___p on the day of the exam.
