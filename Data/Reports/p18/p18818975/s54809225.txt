                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post trauma with spinal decompression.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Again seen is a right-sided chest tube.  Possibility of a small residual
 pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  However, no well-defined area of the
 pneumothorax is identified.  Previously seen lucency along the right heart
 border is much less distinct.  
 
 Again seen is a left subclavian PICC line tip overlying the SVC/RA junction. 
 The upper portion of the mediastinum and lungs are partially obscured by
 spinal fixation hardware and a tracheostomy mask.  
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, unchanged.  No CHF, focal
 consolidation, or effusion is detected.  Possible minimal atelectasis at the
 lung bases. Multiple fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Right chest tube present.  No definite residual pneumothorax identified at
 this time.  Please see comment above.    
 2) No CHF, focal infiltrate, or gross effusion. 
 3) Multiple fractures again noted.
