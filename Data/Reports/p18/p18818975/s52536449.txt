 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p blow to head from falling tree p/w multiple injuries now
 s/p left craniotomy, epidural hematoma evacuation and neurovent placement now
 s/p spinal cord decompression and T2-T6 fixation ___ s/p trach/PEG  //
 interval changes?    interval changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 18 10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 06:00 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. 
 Spinal hardware is again seen overlying the upper thoracic spine. There is a
 improved aeration at the left base were there is still residual patchy opacity
 and likely a small layering effusion suggestive of compressive atelectasis. 
 In addition, there is improving aeration in the left upper lung, although
 there is a residual more focal area of consolidation which could reflect
 residual atelectasis ,although pneumonia, aspiration and pulmonary hemorrhage
 are in the differential. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Right lung remains grossly clear. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Thin lucency beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen consistent with trace pneumoperitoneum. Results were
 communicated to patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 09:44 at the
 time of discovery removal informed me that the patient had a PEG tube placed
 surgically on ___.
