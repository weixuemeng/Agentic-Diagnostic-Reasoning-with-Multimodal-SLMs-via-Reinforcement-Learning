                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RUL collapse, s/p placement of chest tube
 back to suction.  Eval for expansion.  // Eval RUL
 
 COMPARISON:   ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Previously present
 right upper lobe collapse has substantially improved with partial residual
 atelectasis of right upper lobe remaining. However, and there is new right
 middle lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse, likely due to mucous
 plugging within the bronchus intermedius. Small right pleural effusion is
 present, as well as an apparent small right apical pneumothorax with
 indwelling chest tube.
