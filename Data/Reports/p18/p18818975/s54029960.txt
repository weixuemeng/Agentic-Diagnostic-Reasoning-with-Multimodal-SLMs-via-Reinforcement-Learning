 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again no evidence
 of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.  The other monitoring and

 base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung is essentially clear.
