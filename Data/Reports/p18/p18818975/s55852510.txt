                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left craniotomy and T2 to T6 fixation with PEG and
 trach, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:29 p.m.
 
 Again seen is a right-sided chest tube and a left-sided PICC line.  The PICC
 line tip overlies the distal SVC.  Also again noted are a tracheostomy tube
 and pedicle screws related to fixation of the upper thoracic spine. Oxygen
 mask artifact overlies the right lung apex.  Allowing for this, no
 pneumothorax is detected on either side.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate,
 or effusion is detected.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base is noted,
 without significant interval change.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Aside from minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, the lungs
 are grossly clear.  No obvious pneumothorax, though a subtle abnormality at
 the right lung apex could be excluded by overlying mask.
