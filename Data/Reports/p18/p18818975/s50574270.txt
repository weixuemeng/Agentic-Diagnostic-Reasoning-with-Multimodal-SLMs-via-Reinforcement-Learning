                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___M s/p blow to head from falling tree p/w multiple injuries now
 s/p left craniotomy, epidural hematoma evacuation and neurovent placement now
 s/p spinal cord decompression and T2-T6 fixation ___ s/p trach/PEG.  //
 interval changes?    interval changes?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the prominent opacification in
 the left mid to upper zone is no longer present, suggesting that it
 represented an artifact or area of collapse relieved by expectoration of a
 mucous plug.  Mild hazy opacification at the left base could reflect some
 layering pleural fluid with underlying atelectatic changes. The right lung is
 essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
