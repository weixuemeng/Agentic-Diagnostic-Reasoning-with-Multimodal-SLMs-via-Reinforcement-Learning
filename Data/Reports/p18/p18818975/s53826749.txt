                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R lung barotrauma with persistent PTX  //
 compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:43
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, I doubt gross change
 
 Again seen are fractures of the right first and second ribs and ? Right fifth
 rib.  These findings are better delineated on a CT from ___.
 
 There is a relative paucity of lung markings at the right lung apex and,
 although no demarcating lung edge is identified, the possibility of a subtle
 pneumothorax in this area cannot be excluded.   There is also obscuration of a
 portion of the right lung apex by the patient's tracheostomy mask.  Similarly,
 at the right lung base, there is a relative paucity of lung markings, but no
 well demarcated pneumothorax is identified. There is, however, some lucency
 along the medial border of the right lung, at its interface with the right
 mediastinum, similar to the most recent prior film, that likely represents a
 small portion of the pneumothorax.  A tiny pneumomediastinum in this area is
 considered less likely.
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis again noted. Again seen is a left PICC line,
 with tip over distal SVC. Tracheostomy tube, G-tube, and spinal fixation
 hardware again noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle findings suggestive of small residual pneumothorax, detailed above.
