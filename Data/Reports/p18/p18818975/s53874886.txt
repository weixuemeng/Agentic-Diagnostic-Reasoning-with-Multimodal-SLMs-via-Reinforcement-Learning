                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Also noted is trace pneumoperitoneum. The patient's nurse, ___, was
 notified by phone on ___ at 9:44 a.m. who informed me that the patient
 had surgical placement of a PEG tube earlier in the day on ___, which
 likely accounts for this finding.
                                                                       
 ______________________________________________________________________________
 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:39 PM
  Interval removal of an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. The exam is
  grossly unchanged, with patchy opacities in the left lung and a retrocardiac
  opacity similar in appearance compared to approximately 14 hr prior. Spinal
  hardware and a left subclavian line are also unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p tree fall onto head, large skull fx, epidural hematoma
 s/p craniotomy  // interval changes?      interval changes?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 04:58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 18 10 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  The left subclavian
 central line is unchanged in position.  Hardware again overlies the upper
 thoracic spine.  There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation, although
 aeration has slightly improved in this vicinity. Interval development of focal
 opacity in the left upper lung which may represent partial upper lobe collapse
 due to decreased inspiration, although the differential would also include
 aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage (in the setting of a recent line attempt.)
 This can be better assessed on followup imaging. The right lung remains
 grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains unchanged in
 contour.  No pneumothorax.
