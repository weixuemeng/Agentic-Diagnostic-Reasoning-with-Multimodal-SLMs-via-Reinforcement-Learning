                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent cough  // exclude HF, PNA,
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size with left ventricular configuration. 
 The thoracic aorta is tortuous and both the ascending and descending regions,
 similar to the prior study.  Patchy opacities in the left retrocardiac region
 have improved since ___ in show more substantial improvement when
 compared to earlier radiograph of ___ and ___.  Small left pleural
 effusion is again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued improvement in left lower lobe consolidation, likely representing a
 slowly resolving pneumonia.  In the setting of persistent cough, recurrent
 infection or aspiration are additional considerations.
 
 Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to ensure continued improvement
 and to exclude an evolving recurrent pneumonia in this region.
