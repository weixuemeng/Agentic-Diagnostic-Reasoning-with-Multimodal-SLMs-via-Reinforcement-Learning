                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent pneumonia ? post-obstructive  // Have
 infiltrates resolved?      Have infiltrates resolved?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the only prior chest radiographs, ___.
 
 There is still mild loss of volume in the left lower lobe but the infrahilar
 consolidation has improved.  Given the patient's age, it would be reasonable
 to continue radiographic surveillance for continued resolution, rather than
 order a chest CT now to evaluate bronchial patency.  Lungs are otherwise clear
 of focal abnormality.  Previous mild cardiomegaly has improved.  There is no
 pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Lateral view
 displays coronary artery calcifications.
