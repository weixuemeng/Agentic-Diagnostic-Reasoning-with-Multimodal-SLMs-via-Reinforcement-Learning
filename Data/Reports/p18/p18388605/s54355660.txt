                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  In discussion with Dr. ___, ___ patient had left-sided rib pain in
 early ___.  A chest radiograph from ___ did not reveal
 any rib fracture, but was suboptimal for evaluation.  Therefore, on ___, we recommended oblique rib series to evaluate if the left lower lung
 opacity is due to bony callus formation from a rib fracture.  If this is the
 case, then the patient will no longer need a chest CT.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ these findings on the phone with Dr. ___ at 16:15
