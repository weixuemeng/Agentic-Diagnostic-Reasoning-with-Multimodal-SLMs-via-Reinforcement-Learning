                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post colectomy complicated by
 postoperative SIRS.  Assess position of new Dobbhoff feeding tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ at 8:23 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement of a
 Dobbhoff feeding tube with the tip in the stomach.  A smaller caliber
 nasoenteric catheter has been removed.  A right PICC terminates in the low
 SVC.  Bilateral pigtail chest tube drains are in unchanged expected position. 
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  Bibasilar
 opacities are similar to prior and likely reflect ongoing atelectasis.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased in the
 interval.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The heart
 size remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New Dobbhoff feeding tube in the stomach.
 
 2.  Persistent bibasilar opacities, though slightly decreased pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
