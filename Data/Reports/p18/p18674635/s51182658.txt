                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to same day chest radiograph from eight hours
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates new Dobbhoff
 tube projecting over the expected course of the esophagus with distal tip
 coiled in the stomach.  The right subclavian line remains unchanged in
 position.  Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement accompanied by
 bilateral lower lobe opacifications are unchanged since the prior radiograph. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are also unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  New Dobbhoff tube in standard position, terminating in the
 stomach.  Otherwise, unchanged since the prior radiograph.
