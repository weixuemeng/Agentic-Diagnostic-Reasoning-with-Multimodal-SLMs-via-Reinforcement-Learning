                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP erect portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with abdominal pain, likely ischemic
 colitis, evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  Erect portable views of the chest were obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes.  There is left greater than right bilateral perihilar opacities,
 may relate to asymmetric pulmonary edema, although could also relate to
 infectious process.  There is blunting of the left greater than right
 bilateral costophrenic angles, concerning for small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged, likely
 accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  No definite evidence of
 free air on this radiograph, although CT performed earlier the same date may
 be more sensitive.  Air distended loops of relatively featureless bowel are
 partially imaged in the upper abdomen, correlate with CT performed earlier
 today, history of ischemic colitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
 2.  Left greater than right bilateral perihilar opacities may relate to
 asymmetric edema versus infection, depending on the clinical scenario. 
 Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles consistent with small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 3.  Air distended loops of relatively featureless bowel are partially imaged
 in the upper abdomen, correlate with CT performed earlier today, history of
 ischemic colitis.
