                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ON ___ AT 553
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tubes, Dobbhoff, increasing
 shortness of breath, assess for interval change and position of the Dobbhoff
 tube with interval advancement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 550.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 553 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC.  Feeding tube
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. 
 Bilateral pigtail chest tubes remain in place.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Patchy opacities at both bases are again
 seen, which could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  Small left apical and lateral pneumothorax which may have
 slightly increased in size since the previous study.  A tiny right apical
 pneumothorax appears to have developed.  Patient has been subsequently imaged
 at 10:17 a.m. on ___ where the left pigtail catheter has been removed
 and the pneumothorax appears smaller.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.
