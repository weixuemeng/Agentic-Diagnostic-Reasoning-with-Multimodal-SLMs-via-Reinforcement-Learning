 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ at ___.

 evaluate for new pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:17.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval removal of the right pigtail catheter with increase in
 size of a right apical lateral pneumothorax.  In addition, there is an
 increasing left apical lateral pneumothorax.  Patchy right basilar and more
 confluent left opacities are again seen and could reflect atelectasis,
 although an infectious process such as pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered.  No pulmonary edema is evident.  There is likely a small left
 effusion.  Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  A feeding
 tube is seen coursing below this diaphragm with the tip coiled within the
 stomach. Results of this examination were conveyed by phone to the patient's
 nurse, ___, on ___ at 4:16 p.m. at the time of discovery.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
