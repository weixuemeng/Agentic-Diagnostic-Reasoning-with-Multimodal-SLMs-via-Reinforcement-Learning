                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nonspecific colitis, bilateral
 effusions, check for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 6:05.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 5:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate-sized layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflecting partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis,
 although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  No pulmonary
 edema.  Heart remains enlarged, which may represent cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion should also be considered.  Right subclavian central
 line, nasogastric tube, left subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are
 unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not
 visualized on the current study.  No large pneumothorax, although sensitivity
 to detect a pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.
