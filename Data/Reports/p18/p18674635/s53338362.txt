                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of feeding tube.  Apparent resolution of small
 right apical pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement accompanied by slight change in asymmetrically distributed
 opacities in the left perihilar and both lower lobes, with slight improvement
 on the right and slight worsening on the left.  Serial review of prior chest
 x-rays suggests this is due to asymmetrical edema.  Small pleural effusions
 are again demonstrated, left greater than right.
