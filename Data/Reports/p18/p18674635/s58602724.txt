                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancolitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence for elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Opacification at the left base most likely reflects
 combination of atelectasis and effusion, though in the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 No gross evidence of pneumoperitoneum, though this is not an upright view. 
 The dilated and irregular transverse colon seen previously is not included on
 this image.
