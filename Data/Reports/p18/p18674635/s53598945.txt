                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 10:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post removal of left-sided pigtail
 evaluate for left pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 5:53.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the
 stomach.  Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.  The right pigtail
 catheter remains in place and there is a stable tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  The left pigtail catheter has been removed and there is a
 smaller left apical pneumothorax when compared to the previous study.  There
 is increasing airspace consolidation in the lower lungs as well as in the
 lingula.  These findings could reflect pulmonary edema, although aspiration or
 pneumonia should also be considered.  No large pleural effusions.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
