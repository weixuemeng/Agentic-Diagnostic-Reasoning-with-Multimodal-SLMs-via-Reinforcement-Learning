                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Large bilateral layering pleural effusions are present, with
 persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Effusions appear slightly increased
 compared to the prior study, but differences in positioning could account for
 this apparent change.
