                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Resuscitated for pancolitis, fluid overload, now intubated.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:34 p.m., an ET tube has been placed, tip
 approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- the tip tube
 appears to extend beneath the diaphragm, but extends beyond the edge of this
 film.  It cannot be confirmed to be in stomach on these views.
 
 There is cardiomegaly.  There is CHF with upper zone re-distribution and
 moderate sized bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with ___, the ET tube and NG tube are new.  The effusions are
 slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.  
 2.  NG tube probably below diaphragm, but position difficult to confirm.
 3.  Cardiomegaly and CHF.  
 4.  Bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
