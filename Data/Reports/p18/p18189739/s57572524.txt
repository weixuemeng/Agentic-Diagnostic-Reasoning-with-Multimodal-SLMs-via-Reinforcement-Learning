 Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are present, and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved in the
 interval. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis, and there are
 likely trace bilateral pleural effusions, not changed from prior. No
 pneumothorax is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval, with continued small
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
