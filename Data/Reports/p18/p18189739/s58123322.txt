 New left trans subclavian right atrioventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses, continuous from the left pectoral generator. There is no
 pneumothorax, mediastinal widening, or appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 Upper lungs are entirely clear. Right infrahilar opacification has not cleared

 basal consolidation, either atelectasis or pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are probably present as well.
