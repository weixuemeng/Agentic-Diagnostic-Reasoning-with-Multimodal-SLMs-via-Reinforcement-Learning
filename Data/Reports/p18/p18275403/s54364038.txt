                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever for seven days.  Previous treatment for UTI.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low causing bronchovascular crowding.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.  No definite consolidation is identified.  Trace
 pleural effusions may be present.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Prominent
 pulmonary arteries appear unchanged and may indicate pulmonary hypertension. 
 The heart size is accentuated by low lung volumes and likely top normal.  A
 gastric tube is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Finding suggesting slight vascular congestion or fluid overload,
 as well as enlargement of pulmonary arteries, but with no evidence for
 superimposed pneumonia.
