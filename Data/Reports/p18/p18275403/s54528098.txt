                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  No discrete focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary arteries suggests possible pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  The cardiac silhouette is stable.
