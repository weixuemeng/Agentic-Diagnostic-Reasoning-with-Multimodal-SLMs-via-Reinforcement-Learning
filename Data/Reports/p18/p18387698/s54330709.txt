                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old M admitted to ___ with fevers,
 fatigue, and sore throat as well as worsening pleuritic chest pain found to
 have pna at osh.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right heart border is obscured with opacification of the lower half of the
 right hemithorax.  This most likely reflects pleural effusion and substantial
 volume loss of the right lower lung. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed pneumonia is considered.  In addition, there are streaks of
 atelectasis at the left lung base.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Opacification of the lower right hemithorax likely reflects pleural
 effusion and substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia is considered.
