                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease,
 end-stage renal disease and extensive cardiac history with dilated
 cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease status post stenting, severe mitral
 regurgitation and systolic heart failure, now with right-sided inspiratory
 crackle on physical exam, here to evaluate for pulmonary pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ with
 multiple prior chest radiographs.
 
 There is a large round focal consolidation in the right lung base which does
 not obscure the right heart border, but appears to project over the heart on
 the corresponding lateral radiograph.  There is mild interstitial edema, which
 is decreased from ___, and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion with
 fluid in the fissures.  The lung volumes are appropriate.  There is a small
 probably left-sided pleural effusion noted on the lateral radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  A
 left pectoral single channel pacemaker/defibrillator is again seen with one
 lead terminating in the right ventricular apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal round consolidation in the right middle lobe may represent
 pneumonia or a right fissural pleural collection.  Please correlate clinically
 and if indicated, an oblique chest radiograph could be considered for further
 evaluation.
 
 Findings were posted by Dr. ___ to the critical results radiology
 dashboard for communication to Dr. ___ at 5:30PM on ___.
