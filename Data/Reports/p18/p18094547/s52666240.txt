                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of constant chest pain
 for 24 hours.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Given this, there is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Surgical clips are seen in the upper
 abdomen, presumably from prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No significant interval
 change.  If high clinical concern for pneumothorax persists, consider
 inspiratory and expiratory views.
