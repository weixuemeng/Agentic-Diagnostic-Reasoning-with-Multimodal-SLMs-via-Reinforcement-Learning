                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The bilateral pigtail catheters in the pleural space are in
 constant position.  The effusions have bilaterally increased; on the right,
 this increase is more obvious than on the left.  Retrocardiac atelectasis
 persists.  The known right upper lobe parenchymal opacity with air
 bronchograms and a similar but more subtle opacity on the left are virtually
 unchanged.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
