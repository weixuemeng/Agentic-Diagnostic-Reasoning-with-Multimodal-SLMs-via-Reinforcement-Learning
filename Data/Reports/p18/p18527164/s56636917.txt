                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest shows low lung volumes
 and mild to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
 with adjacent atelectasis.  Underlying infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  Median sternotomy wires and Corevalve are in place.  The aorta is
 tortuous and calcified.  The pulmonary vessels are prominent and ill defined
 with hazy opacities bilaterally, compatible with pulmonary edema. 
 Emphysematous changes are redemonstrated with scattered rounded lucencies
 throughout both upper lungs.  There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous
 structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
 right, and moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
