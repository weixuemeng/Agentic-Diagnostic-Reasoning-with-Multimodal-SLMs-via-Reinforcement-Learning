 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, ovarian cancer, confirm nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip of the tube is in the proximal parts of the
 stomach, the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  Tube
 should be advanced by approximately 5 cm.
 
 Newly appeared right pleural effusion with moderate layering and moderate
 extent.  The pre-existing left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in
 extent.  As a consequence of both effusions, lung volumes are low and there
 are bilateral areas of basal atelectasis.
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
