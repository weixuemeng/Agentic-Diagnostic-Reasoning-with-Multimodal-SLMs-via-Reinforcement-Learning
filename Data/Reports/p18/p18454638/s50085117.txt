                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anterior myocardial infarction on TandemHeart, here to evaluate
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube and enteric tube are unchanged in position. 
 The TandemHeart catheter now projects over the mid heart, which is more
 cephalad compared to the prior study and could be in the pulmonary outflow
 tract.  There is improved aeration of the lung apices with redistribution of
 pleural fluid into the bases.  A moderate layering right pleural effusion and
 small if any left pleural effusion are overall similar to the prior exam. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  There is persistent mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is
 decreased in size from ___.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  More cephalad position of TandemHeart catheter, which may be in the
 pulmonary outflow tract.
 2.  Similar moderate right pleural effusion and small, if any, left pleural
 effusion with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Decrease size of cardiac silhouette from ___.
