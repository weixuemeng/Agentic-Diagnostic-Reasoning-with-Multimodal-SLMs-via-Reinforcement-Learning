                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  At radiation oncology for lung carcinoma, status post treatment
 yesterday.  Now with fevers, abdominal pain, loose stools, nausea, and
 orthostatic hypotension.  Evaluate for intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A left
 perihilar opacity, consistent with known lung carcinoma as seen on prior
 PET-CT from ___, is decreased in size compared to prior chest
 radiograph from ___.  A 5-mm round opacity superior to the left
 hilus is likely a vessel on end, although a small pulmonary nodule cannot be
 completely excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Decreased size of left lower lobe pulmonary mass.  5-mm round opacity
 superior to the left hilus is likely a vessel on end, although a small
 pulmonary nodule cannot be completely excluded.
