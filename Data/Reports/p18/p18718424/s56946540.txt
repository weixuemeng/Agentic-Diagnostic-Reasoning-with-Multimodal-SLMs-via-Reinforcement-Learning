                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Low blood pressure this morning.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild cardiomegaly is similar. 
 Aortic calcifications are most pronounced at the aortic knob.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated with relative
 lucency in the apices compatible with emphysema.  Minimal patchy opacity in
 the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Diffuse demineralization of
 the osseous structures is noted with mild decreased height of mid thoracic
 vertebral body, unchanged.  Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded.
