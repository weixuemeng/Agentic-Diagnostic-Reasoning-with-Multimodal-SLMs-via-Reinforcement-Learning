                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of underlying
 COPD.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is likely present.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Cholecystectomy
 clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is again redemonstrated with loss
 of height of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior study with mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no frank pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
