                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis syndrome with CHF, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vasculature is less
 engorged, though it is unclear whether this reflects improved pulmonary venous
 status or the upright technique.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with
 bibasilar atelectasis are seen.  Pacer leads remain in good position.
