                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer and lymphoma with worsening leukocytosis and cough, to
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Surgical clips are seen in the right apex and
 hilar regions consistent with prior surgery for malignancy.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour also indicating low lung
 volumes on the right.  The Port-A-Cath is unchanged.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  There is no convincing evidence of acute
 pneumonia.
