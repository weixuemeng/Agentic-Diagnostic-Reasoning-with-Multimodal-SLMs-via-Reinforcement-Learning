                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal supine chest radiograph demonstrates left basilar
 opacity.  There is linear atelectasis of the right lung base.  Bilateral
 effusions are present, small on the right and moderate on the left.  There is
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature compatible with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Heart size is enlarged, as is the main pulmonary artery.  There is
 calcification of the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left base consolidation, likely representing pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Recommend
 dedicated upright view when clinically able to document resolution. The
 differential diagnosis includes an obstructive mass, or large pulmonary
 embolus.
 
 2. Mild cardiac decompensation.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the MICU at 8:50AM by phone.
