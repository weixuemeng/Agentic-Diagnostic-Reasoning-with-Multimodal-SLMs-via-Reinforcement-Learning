 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:34 PM
  R IJ terminates in upper SVC. No definite ptx although somewhat difficult to
  exclude given technical limitations. Decreased pulmonary edema. B/l pleural
  effusion, left greater than right, not appreciably changed from radiograph
  earlier the same day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with CHF exacerbation.  Possible cardiogenic shock. 
 Look for pneumonia and Cordis line placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___ at 3:16 a.m.:
 
 Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.  Small right and
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion persist and partially obscure what
 could be areas of consolidation in both lower lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged.  Fullness in the mediastinum in the region of the
 pulmonary outflow tract raises the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.  In
 addition to a possibility of pneumonia in both lower lobes, particularly the
 left, clinical attention should be paid to the possibility of pericardial
 effusion, although I see no evidence of elevated central venous pressure by
 way of mediastinal widening.  Right internal jugular introducer ends at the
 junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  There is no pneumothorax.
