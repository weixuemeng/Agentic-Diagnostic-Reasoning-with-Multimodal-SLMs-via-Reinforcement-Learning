                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ovoid lesion on portable CXR  //
 ?characterization
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the predescribed ovoid lesion is less
 visually apparent.  These supports the previous suspicion that this density
 was caused by a degenerative change at the level of the first costosternal
 junction. However, as recommended, a lordotic view is recommended to further
 assess this area and evaluate the potential need for CT.
 
 No other change, constant appearance of the heart and the lung parenchyma.
