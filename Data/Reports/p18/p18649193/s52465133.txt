 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Metastatic renal cancer with seizures, assess for infection.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Opacity projecting in one of
 the lower lobes, seen in the lateral view, is worrisome for pneumonia given
 the clinical symptoms.  Patient has known lung nodules, better seen in prior
 CT.  Opacity anterior to the left major fissure, seen in the lateral view,
 could be due to atelectasis or other area of infection.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Moderate degenerative changes are in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonia.
 
 Lung nodules are better seen in prior CT.
