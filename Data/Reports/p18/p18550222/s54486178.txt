 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening nocturnal dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, apparently via an anomalous left-sided superior
 vena cava, appears unchanged.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  Patchy
 opacities about the heart suggest unchanged atelectasis or scarring in the
 adjacent lung parenchyma associated with cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear similar.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is
 a slight upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vascularity, but no overt
 congestive heart failure.  There is patchy posterior basilar opacity,
 silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm suggesting a trace right-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No overt evidence for cardiac failure although slight upper zone
 redistribution suggesting venous hypertension.  
 
 2.  Very small suspected right-sided pleural effusion with associated opacity,
 likely minor atelectasis.
