                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, assess cardiomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips are again noted.  A dual-lead pacer
 projects over the left chest wall with lead tips ascending into the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  There are flattened diaphragms, which could reflect COPD. 
 Coarsened lung markings could reflect underlying emphysema, though the
 possibility of mild congestion is impossible to exclude.  There is no frank
 pulmonary edema or definite signs of pneumonia.  Mediastinal contour is stable
 with unfolded thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcifications noted.  The
 imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  COPD with coarsened interstitial markings,
 possibly reflecting emphysema, though mild congestion impossible to exclude.
