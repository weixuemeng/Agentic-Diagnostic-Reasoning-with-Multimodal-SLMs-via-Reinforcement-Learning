 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right subclavian infusion port follows a standard course.  Lung volumes are
 lower, reflected in increased bibasilar atelectasis and exaggeration of
 pulmonary vascular caliber.  Small pleural effusions are new.  Heart size is
 normal.  No pneumothorax.  A new catheter is noted in the right upper abdomen,
 but cannot be localized on this single conventional view.
