                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rising white blood cell count with slight increased O2
 requirement.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 right-sided pacemaker with associated biventricular leads is not significantly
 changed.  Abandoned leads from a previous left-sided pacemaker are
 re-demonstrated.  Lung volumes are low, decreased compared to the prior study
 from ___.  Bibasilar consolidative opacities are slightly
 increased, possibly due to atelectasis, although infection could have an
 identical appearance.  There are moderate bilateral layering pleural
 effusions.  The heart size is not significantly changed.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A severe compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in bibasilar consolidative opacities, likely atelectasis,
 although infection could be present in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Marked compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, age
 indeterminant.
