                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia and dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Retrocardiac opacity is decreased from
 prior study, possibly atelectasis and scarring from prior pneumonia.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is a large hiatus hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Decreased conspicuity of previously visualized retrocardiac opacity in the
 left lower lobe. While this may represent residual scarring and/or
 atelectasis.  No evidence of focal consolidation elsewhere.
 2. Large hiatus hernia.
