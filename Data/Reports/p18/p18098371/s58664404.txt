                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with 2 hrs of chest pain, pmhx CHF  // eval for
 pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Comparison to prior examination is difficult secondary to severe patient
 rotation and lordosis. The aorta is ectatic. .  Right basal opacification is
 similar to the prior examination and likely atelectasis perhaps with
 bronchiectasis. There is no definite consolidation, large pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax identified. Redemonstrated is an incompletely
 imaged, chronic right humeral fracture, unchanged from the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Within the limitations of patient positioning, there is no definitive airspace
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia. If clinically warranted, repeat
 radiographs could be performed with improved positioning.
