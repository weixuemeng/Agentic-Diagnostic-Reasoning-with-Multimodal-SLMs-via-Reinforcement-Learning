 INDICATION:  ___F with moderate AS, HTN here with CHF and new SOB despite
 diuresis.  // Eval for pulm edema      Eval for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 15 46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient's mandible obscures the lung apices.  The patchy opacity at the
 right lung base is less well appreciated due to differences in positioning but
 is likely not changed.  No new area of consolidation is appreciated. There is
 no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 patient positioning.  Deformity of the right proximal humerus is consistent
 with old fracture.
