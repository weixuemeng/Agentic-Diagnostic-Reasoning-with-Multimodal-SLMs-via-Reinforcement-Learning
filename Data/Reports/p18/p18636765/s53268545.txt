                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is a dual lead pacemaker/ICD
 device that appears unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 similar.  The aortic arch is again calcified.  There is mild relative
 elevation of the anterior right hemidiaphragm, as seen previously and
 suggesting a small eventration.  Patchy basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis or scarring and appear unchanged.  In addition, there is a vague
 retrocardiac opacity with increased density which potentially indicates early
 infection.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague new retrocardiac opacity, potentially due to pneumonia;
 lower airway inflammation or infection could also be considered in addition to
 bronchopneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to evaluate
 further if clinically indicated.
