                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, crackles, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Chest x-ray from ___ at 9:17 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is more pronounced patchy opacity in the
 right cardiophrenic and retrocardiac regions with new blunting of both
 costophrenic angles.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. 
 The findings could reflect the presence of an infectious infiltrate.  The
 cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger, not clearly accounted for by
 technique, but is otherwise stable.  A left-sided pacemaker is present, with
 lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities at both bases, more pronounced compared with
 ___, with new small pleural effusions.  Possibility of pneumonic
 infiltrates cannot be excluded.
