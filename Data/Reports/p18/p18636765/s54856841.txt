                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 957 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with liver mass and shortness of breath,
 assess for worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Single frontal view of the chest ___ at 957 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is increasing bibasilar opacity which would be concerning for
 worsening aspiration or pneumonia.  There is also likely mild superimposed
 interstitial edema.  A pacemaker is again seen on the left side with the leads
 terminating over the expected locations of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is probably a small left effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Patient's mandible
 obscures the apices.
