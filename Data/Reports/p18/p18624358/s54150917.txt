                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Delirium, postop from hip surgery two days ago, history of CHF,
 severe aortic stenosis, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:39 a.m.
 
 On the current study, there is considerable patient rotation.  As before,
 there is severe background COPD and moderately severe cardiomegaly.  Again
 seen are diffusely increased interstitial markings which have been previously
 described as representing interstitial pulmonary edema.  Allowing for
 differences in positioning, the overall appearance is similar to prior.  No
 new areas of consolidation, no more extensive interstitial involvement, and no
 gross effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Moderately severe
 degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted, not fully
 evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly and increased interstitial markings, similar to the
 ___ radiograph.  Allowing for positioning, no new focal consolidation
 and no effusion.
