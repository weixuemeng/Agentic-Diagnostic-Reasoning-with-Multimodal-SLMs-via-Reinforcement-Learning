                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  Cuff is inflated
 just beyond the tracheal caliber. A right-sided IJ terminates at the low SVC. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no pulmonary edema.  A small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged, accompanied by basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube terminating 3.4 cm above the carina. The tube cuff is
 expanded just beyond tracheal caliber. Unchanged small left pleural effusion
 and bibasilar atelectasis.
