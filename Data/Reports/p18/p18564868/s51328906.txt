 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in the lung
 bases are compatible subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
