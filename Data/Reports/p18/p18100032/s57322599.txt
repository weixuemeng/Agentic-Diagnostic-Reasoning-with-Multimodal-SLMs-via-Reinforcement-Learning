                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement in a patient status post
 exploratory laparotomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  There is
 a large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse and a smaller
 volume of right lower lobe atelectasis.  The left upper lobe is overinflated.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal. Aortic contour is poorly
 defined, and should be reevaluated after reversal of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse, and small right
 lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Abnormality of the aortic contour could be due to atelectasis; however,
 followup radiograph after treatment of the atelectasis is recommended to
 evaluate the aortic contour.
 
 COMMENT:  These findings were communicated to ___ at 12:07PM on
 ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ 5 minutes after the time
 of discovery.
