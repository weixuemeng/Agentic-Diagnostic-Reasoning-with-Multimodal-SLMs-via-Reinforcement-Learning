                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CP STEMI  // acuteprocess
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   The lungs appear hyperinflated likely
 due to underlying emphysema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with
 mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no overt edema.  A subtle peripheral
 linear density in the right upper lung close to the EKG lead may represent a
 focus of scarring or atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Heart is top-normal. 
 Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Bony structures appear intact though
 demineralized station is noted diffusely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  No overt signs
 of edema.
