 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new onset of AFib.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA lnd lateral views of the chest. No prior.  On the lateral view,
 there is a vague nodular opacity projecting over the aortic arch which may
 localize to the right upper lung.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular opacity
 projecting over one of the upper lobes, presumably on the right for which
 chest CT is suggested to further characterize.
