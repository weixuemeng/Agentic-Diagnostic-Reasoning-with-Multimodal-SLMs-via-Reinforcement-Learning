                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with tachypnea and labored breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a marked
 interval increase in bibasilar air space opacities and probable small pleural
 effusions.  The pulmonary vasculature remains normal.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size, and is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are notable
 only for calcification of the aortic knob.  A left chest two-lead cardiac
 pacemaker is in stable and standard configuration.  There is marked gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities.  Considerations include
 developing pulmonary edema, although the pulmonary vasculature appears normal
 and the heart size is unchanged, making this an atypical appearance for edema.
 Alternatively, developing infection may give this appearance although this
 doesn't fit with the clinical presentation as it would be expected that the
 patient would be very ill if pneumonia were this widespread.
 
 2.  Gaseous distention of the stomach can put the patient at risk for
 aspiration, and decompression of this is recommended.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:15 a.m. by phone.
