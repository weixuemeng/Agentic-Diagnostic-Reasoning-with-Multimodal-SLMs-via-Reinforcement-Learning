                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fatigue  // evidence of pneumonia

 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Left chest wall AICD is noted with lead tip extending to the region of the
 right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. 
 The lungs appear hyperinflated.  Upper lung lucency suggests emphysema.  Lower
 lung opacities likely reflect bronchovascular crowding and mild atelectasis. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  No convincing signs of congestion or
 edema.  Heart appears mildly enlarged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with stress shin of emphysema and lower lung atelectasis
 and bronchovascular crowding.  Mild cardiomegaly.
