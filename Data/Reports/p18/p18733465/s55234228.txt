                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with question of seizure, head injury, altered
 mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Hilar contours are unchanged and
 remain prominent.  Lungs appear hyperinflated with probable mild emphysematous
 changes in the upper lobes.  Patchy opacity within the right lung base is
 nonspecific and may reflect an area of atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.  Minimal streaky left basilar opacity is also noted.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Calcified pleural and parenchymal scarring is
 seen within the lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the right,
 which could reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
