                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are bibasilar opacities which
 could be secondary to atelectasis given the low lung volumes on the current
 exam.  Rounded opacity in the posterior left costophrenic sulcus is compatible
 with a rounded opacity on prior chest CT.  Subcentimeter nodular opacity seen
 in the left mid lung and vaguely identified on prior chest x-ray without clear
 parenchymal abnormality on interval CT scan.  Superiorly the lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality identified.  Multiple air-fluid levels seen
 throughout nondilated loops of small bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis given relatively lower lung
 volumes, noting infection cannot be excluded.  Rounded opacity in the left
 posterior costophrenic sulcus better characterized on prior exam.  
 
 Additional nodule projecting over the left midlung was present which is more
 conspicuous on today's chest x-ray noting there was no parenchymal abnormality
 on interval CT scan.  Attention on followup of this is suggested.  
 
 Air-fluid levels identified in the small bowel in the upper abdomen for which
 clinical correlation is suggested.
