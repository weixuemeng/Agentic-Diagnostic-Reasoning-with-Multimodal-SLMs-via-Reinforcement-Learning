                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Small left effusion with adjacent opacities
 is again noted, the adjacent opacities have minimally worsened consistent with
 worsening atelectasis and/or infection.  The right lung is grossly clear.  The
 pulmonary arteries are enlarged as before.  There is no pneumothorax.
