 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pulling of PICC line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line on the right
 is in completely unchanged position.  In the interval, the patient has
 received a right internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter.  The tip of the
 catheter projects over the mid-to-low SVC.  No evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  The appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the
 lung parenchyma is constant.
