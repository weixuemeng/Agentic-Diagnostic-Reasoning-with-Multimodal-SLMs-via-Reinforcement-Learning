                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Morbid obesity.  Multiple strokes, evaluation for left-sided
 hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the image is technically
 limited.  The lung volumes are low.  Increased diameter of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Irregularities along several left ribs, likely caused by trauma. 
 The extent of a pre-existing small left pleural effusion is increasing,
 increasing atelectasis at the left lung base.  The diameter of the aortic knob
 is slightly increased, but no apical cap is seen.  Radiographic appearance of
 the mediastinal width, and in particular of the aortic arch, should be closely
 monitored by chest radiographs.  Unremarkable appearance of the right lung,
 except for low lung volumes and crowding of the vascular structures at the
 lung bases.
