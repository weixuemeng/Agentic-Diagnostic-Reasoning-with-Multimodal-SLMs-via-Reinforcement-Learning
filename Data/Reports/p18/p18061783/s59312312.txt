                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with morbid obesity, admitted with pneumonia versus
 volume overload, persisting hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.  There
 has been interval increase in left lower opacities, a combination of pleural
 effusion and adjacent consolidation.  This consolidation could be atelectasis,
 but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Moderate to large right
 effusion has increased.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
