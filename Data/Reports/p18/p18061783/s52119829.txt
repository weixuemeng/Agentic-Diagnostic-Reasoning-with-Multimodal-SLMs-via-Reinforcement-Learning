                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall on left side, chest wall tenderness.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged, similar to prior study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  No definite fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which crowds the pulmonary vasculature.  Within
 that limitation, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.  No fracture is identified.
