  Developing peripheral opacity at the right and left lateral lung bases is
  likely secondary to lung infarction as sequela from patient's massive
  pulmonary embolus.  Opacity at the medial left lung base is likely secondary
  to atelectasis, however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. Mild
  pulmonary edema.
