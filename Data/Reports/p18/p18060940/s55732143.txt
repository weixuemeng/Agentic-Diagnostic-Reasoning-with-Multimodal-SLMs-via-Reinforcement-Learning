                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GBM admitted for massive pulmonary embolus
 s/p lysis with tPA.  // pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of an enteric
 tube that is seen in the stomach, but its tip extends beyond the inferior
 margin of the image. The endotracheal tube is located approximately 3.8 cm
 from the carina. There are diffuse patchy opacities that is likely a
 combination of mild pulmonary edema and bronchovascular crowding from low lung
 volumes.  There are no large pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Diffuse patchy opacities that is likely due to both low lung volumes and
 mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Interval placement of an enteric tube that extends to at least the
 stomach.
