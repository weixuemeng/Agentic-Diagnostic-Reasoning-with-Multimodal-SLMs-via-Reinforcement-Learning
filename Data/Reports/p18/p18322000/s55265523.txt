                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever, chills, and right lower lobe
 crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  An ill-defined opacity is seen in the
 right lower lobe. Loss of the vascular markings in the retrocardiac space
 suggest a mild consolidation in this location as well. Mild cardiomegaly is
 present with associated upper vascular redistribution and mild hilar
 engorgement. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right lower lobe and possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of mild cardiomegaly.
