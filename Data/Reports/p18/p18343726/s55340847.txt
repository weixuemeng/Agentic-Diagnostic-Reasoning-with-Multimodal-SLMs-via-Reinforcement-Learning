                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with prior radiograph showing
 left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is interval improvement,
 but no complete resolution of the left lower lobe opacity.  There are no new
 opacities noted to suggest new infectious process.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Partial improvement of previously demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Reevaluation of the patient in four weeks with chest radiograph is recommended
 for documentation of complete resolution.  If clinically warranted, assessment
 with chest CT might be considered.
 
 2.  Suspected hiatal hernia.
