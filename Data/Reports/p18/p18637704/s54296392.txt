 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recent ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is a right-sided cardiac pacing device with leads following the expected
 course to the right atrium and ventricle. Low lung volumes are persistent. 
 Small right effusion is likely unchanged.  Opacities in the left mid-lung
 follow the trajectory of a previously placed thoracostomy tube.  A band of
 atelectasis at the right base is more pronounced.  Mild vascular congestion is
 minimally changed from ___.  Widening of the mediastinum has mildly
 improved from ___.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  A right IJ catheter terminates in the right atrium.
