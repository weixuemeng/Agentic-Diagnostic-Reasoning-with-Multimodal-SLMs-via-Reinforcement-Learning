                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left hip fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Diffuse increased
 interstitial opacities are new compared to the previous chest radiograph,
 compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Known left upper lobe
 opacity is re- demonstrated, and a large right pleural effusion is similar
 compared to the previous CT.  There is right basilar compressive atelectasis. 
 Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Right VP shunt catheter is seen coursing along the right anterior
 chest, and into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Unchanged left upper lobe lung opacity
 better characterized on the prior PET CT. Large right pleural effusion with
 right basilar atelectasis, and small left pleural effusion.
