                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:47 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer and obstructive
 pneumonia and malignant pleural effusion, now with a right PleurX catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 11:43 a.m.:
 
 There has been a slight increase in aeration in the right lower lung, due to
 either some withdrawal of right pleural effusion, although I no longer can see
 the Pleurx catheter at the base of the right chest, or some improvement in
 what is most likely severe obstruction to the right middle and lower lobe. 
 Rightward mediastinal shift is mild but unchanged.  There is no right
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse micronodular and linear interstitial abnormality in the
 left lung is probably a combination of edema and disseminated tumor or at
 least lymphatic occlusion.  A drainage catheter traverses the right neck,
 chest and upper abdomen.
