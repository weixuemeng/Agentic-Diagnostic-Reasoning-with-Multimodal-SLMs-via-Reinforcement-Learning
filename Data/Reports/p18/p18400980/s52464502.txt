                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lung cancer and new pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___ and PET-CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent large
 right-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the right lower lobe and shift
 of the mediastinum to the right.  Again seen are stable appearing diffuse
 increased interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema or
 lymphangitic spread of lung cancer.  There is a small left-sided pleural
 effusion. Multiple nodules are seen in the left lung, but were better
 evaluated on recent PET-CT.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right VP shunt catheter is seen
 coursing along the right chest, and into the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable appearing diffuse increased interstitial opacities consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema differential diagnosis include lymphangitic spread of
 lung cancer.
 
 2.  Persistent large right-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the right
 lower lobe and shift of the mediastinum to the right.
