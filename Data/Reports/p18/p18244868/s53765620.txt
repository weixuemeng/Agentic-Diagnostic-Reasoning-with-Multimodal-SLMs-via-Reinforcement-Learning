                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with fall  // rib fracture?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low.  The lungs are clear.  Skin fold overlying
 the left lung apex mimics a pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right posterior
 costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No displaced acute
 fractures.  Deformity of the proximal left humerus suggests prior healed
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable small right pleural effusion.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
