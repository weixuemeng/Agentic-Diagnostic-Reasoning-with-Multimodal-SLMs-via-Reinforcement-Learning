                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dCHF complaining of worsening SOB.  //
 evaluate for pulmonary edema or effusions      evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 There are no findings to suggest cardiac decompensation, no edema, no pleural
 effusion. Heart size is exaggerated by mediastinal fat.
 
 Extensive extrapleural fat overlie areas of the lungs and distorts normal
 anatomic interfaces new, and there is abundant chest wall soft tissue, both of
 which make it difficult to detect subtle pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 For example there Could be regions of peribronchial opacification around the
 lower pole of both hila, due to a subtle pneumonia, or there may be diminished
 profusion to the right upper lobe, an occasional presentation of acute
 pulmonary embolus.
 
 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Consider clinical justification for chest CTA to evaluate
 possible pneumonia or acute pulmonary embolus.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with  ___  M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 3:38 PM, 2 minutes after
