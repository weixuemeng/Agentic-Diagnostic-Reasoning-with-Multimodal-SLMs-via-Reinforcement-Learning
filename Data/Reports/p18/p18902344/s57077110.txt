 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weight gain and shortness of breath.  Question
 fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam

 lungs appear hyperinflated.  There is right basilar opacity, more conspicuous
 than on prior exam, which correlates with prominent mediastinal fat when
 compared to previous CT of the abdomen and pelvis from ___. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  There is no frank evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are difficult to assess given technique.
