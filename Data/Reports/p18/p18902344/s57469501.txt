                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 contours appear unchanged.  Perihilar fullness with a predominantly central to
 lower lung interstitial abnormality is fairly similar, most consistent with
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, somewhat worse than on the
 prior examination but similar in pattern.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
