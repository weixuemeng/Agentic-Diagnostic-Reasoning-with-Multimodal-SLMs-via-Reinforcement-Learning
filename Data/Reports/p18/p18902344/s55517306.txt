                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Assessment of the lung bases is limited due to poor inspiratory volumes, with
 a retrocardiac opacity possibly reflecting atelectasis.  Infection or
 aspiration is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Assessment for a
 pleural effusion is limited on these views as the left costophrenic angle is
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study.  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases. 
 Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
