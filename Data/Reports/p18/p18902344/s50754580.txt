                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:30.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip
 terminating approximately 6.1 cm from the carina.  An orogastric tube tip
 courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film.  
 
 Study is limited due to patient rotation.  Worsening opacification of the
 right lung base is noted and may be attributable to patient rotation.  There
 may be a small right pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is not
 included in this exam.  Streaky left basilar opacity also persists.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning and endotracheal tube.  
 
 2.  Orogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders
 of the film.  
 
 3.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities and pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Possible small right pleural effusion.
