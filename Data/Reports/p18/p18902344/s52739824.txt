                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right flank pain, status post fall, assess rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Stable opacity
 obscuring the inferior aspect of the right heart border is most compatible
 with a prominent epicardial fat pad.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No
 displaced rib fracture or other osseous injury is evident.  If there is strong
 clinical concern, recommend dedicated rib series for further evaluation.
