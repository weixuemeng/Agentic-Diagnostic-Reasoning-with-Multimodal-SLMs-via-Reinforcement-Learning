 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  New left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the left
 brachiocephalic vein, with no visible pneumothorax.  Improved aeration in the
 right lower lobe since the recent radiograph.  Peripheral area of
 consolidation in right upper lobe is seen to better detail on recent CT
 C-spine study and could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
