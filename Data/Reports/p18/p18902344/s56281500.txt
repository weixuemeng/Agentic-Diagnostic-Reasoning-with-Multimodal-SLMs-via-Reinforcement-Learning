                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with morbid obesity, restrictive lung disease with
 pneumonia on chest x-ray performed at outside institution.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two PA and one lateral radiograph were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Neither of the frontal films adequately evaluates the right lung base.  There
 are changes in the right lung base possibly representing thickening of a
 slightly displaced fissure or accessory fissure possibly fluid on the ___ radiograph which are partially seen and unchanged from before.  There is
 perhaps some early peribronchial cuffing changes, but no good evidence of
 congestion.  Prominent extrapleural opacities along both hemidiaphragms may
 represent fat versus pleural thickening or chronic effusions, unchanged from
 radiograph dated ___.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Inadequate assessment of the right lung base.  However, based on the
 radiographs available and compared to prior radiographs, the appearances are
 likely not significantly changed and I do not definitively see anything
 suggestive of an acute pneumonic consolidation.
