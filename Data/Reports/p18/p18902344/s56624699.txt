                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided rib pain after falling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal atelectasis is
 noted within the right middle lobe.  Smooth bilateral pleural thickening is
 seen laterally, unchanged, likely reflecting subpleural fat deposition. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes within the thoracic spine.  No displaced rib fractures
 are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No displaced rib fractures seen.  If there is continued clinical concern for a
 rib fracture, a dedicated rib series is recommended.
