                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with h/o CHF presenting with worsening SOB  //
 evidence of worsening pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study is somewhat underpenetrated, likely due to patient body habitus. 
 Given this, the hila appear somewhat prominent and ill-defined, which may be
 due to vascular engorgement with pulmonary vascular congestion.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen.  No definite focal consolidation although assessment
 of the lung bases is less than optimal given underpenetration.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
