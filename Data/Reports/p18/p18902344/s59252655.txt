                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral swelling and history of diastolic heart failure.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac enlargement is similar.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities suggesting
 minor atelectasis or scarring which are quite similar for the most part.  A
 new band-like opacity projecting along the posterior right lower lobe is
 suggestive of atelectasis, while a pleural effusion has resolved on the left. 
 A small right-sided pleural effusion appears unchanged, however.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of bibasilar atelectasis without evidence for
 pulmonary edema.  Very small right-sided pleural effusion, similar to the
 prior examination, although a left-sided pleural effusion has improved.
