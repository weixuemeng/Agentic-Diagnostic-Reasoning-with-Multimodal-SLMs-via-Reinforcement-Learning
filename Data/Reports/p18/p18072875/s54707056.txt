                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress and multifocal pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from the prior day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread consolidation in the left upper lobe appears similar,
 but comparing to the scout view from the prior examination, there is seemingly
 new retrocardiac opacification.  In each lung, there is also a widespread new
 background hazy appearance; to some extent, this is probably be attributed to
 layering pleural effusions, which may have increased, versus worsening of
 multifocal pneumonia, coinciding fluid overload, or developing respiratory
 distress syndrome.
