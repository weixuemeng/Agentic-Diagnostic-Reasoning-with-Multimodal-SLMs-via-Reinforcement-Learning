                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right upper lobe mass, status post biopsy. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy catheter is in appropriate
 position.  A right juxtahilar mass is redemonstrated.  No post-procedural
 pneumothorax is evident.  There is increasing density over the right heart
 border which likely reflects new atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is
 evident.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No post-procedural pneumothorax
 2.  Unchanged appearance of a right juxtahilar mass
 3.  Probable new right middle lobe atelectasis
