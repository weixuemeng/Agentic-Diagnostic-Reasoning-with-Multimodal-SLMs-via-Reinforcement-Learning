                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  ___-year-old male with cough, status post tracheostomy.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is apparent interval increase in size of a right perihilar
 mass, with less well-defined borders, and the appearance of a hazy opacity in
 the right upper lobe distal to the mass which would be concerning for a
 post-obstructive pneumonia.   Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position, ending 3.7 cm
 above the carina.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in size of perihilar mass with right
 upper lobe distal opacity raising concern for postobstructive pneumonia. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.
