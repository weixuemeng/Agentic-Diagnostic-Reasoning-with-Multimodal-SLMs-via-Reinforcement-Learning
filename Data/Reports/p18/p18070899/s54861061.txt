                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year s/p hemothorax evacuation left side  // interval eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, lung volume has minimally decreased, accentuating
 the lung markings.  There is persistent left basal pleural abnormality with
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, likely due to persistent pleural fluid
 and associated volume loss.  Nodular opacity projecting over the left anterior
 third rib is likely a fissural nodule, measuring up to 1.2 cm.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due to
 volume loss associated leftward shift, the likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent left basal pleural abnormality, stable in size and extent.
 2. Left fissural nodule.
