                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 11:41 from outside hospital
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflects primarily the
 presence of a large pleural effusion, likely hemothorax, with associated left
 basilar atelectasis, with mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures. 
 Contusion within the left lung base cannot be excluded.  Low lung volumes are
 seen in the right lung with patchy atelectasis in the right lung base.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Displaced fracture of the left seventh posterior
 rib is re- demonstrated.   There is no overt pulmonary edema in the right
 lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion, likely hemothorax, with associated left basilar
 atelectasis, although lung contusion is not excluded.  Displaced left seventh
 posterior rib fracture.
