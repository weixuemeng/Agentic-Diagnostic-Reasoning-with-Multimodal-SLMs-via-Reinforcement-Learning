                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Prior opacities, to assess for clearing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with ill-defined pulmonary vessels
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The possibility of
 chronic pulmonary disease would require CT for exclusion if this is a
 reasonable clinical diagnosis.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
