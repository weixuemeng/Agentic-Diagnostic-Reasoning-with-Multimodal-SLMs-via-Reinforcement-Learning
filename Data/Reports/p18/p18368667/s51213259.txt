                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute process, question fluid overload, question acute process. 
 Wheezing.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Single AP view of the chest from ___ on ___.
 
 A dual-lumen catheter is present, with tips over the distal SVC and SVC/RA
 junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.  There is upper
 zone redistribution, diffuse vascular plethora and mild vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF.  No effusion.  No obvious focal consolidation.  
 
 Again seen are changes of the right humeral head with some fragmentation and
 heterotopic ossification, which appear related to post-traumatic or
 neuropathic changes.  The humeral head itself appears similar to ___,
 but there appears to be some interval development of heterotopic ossification
 about the right shoulder. Resorptive changes of the clavicles, left greater
 than right, are again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Findings consistent with CHF/fluid overload.
