 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the degree of right apical pneumothorax.  Asymmetry of opacification at the
 right base with elevation of the hemidiaphragm suggests splinting related to
 the previously described rib fractures.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed aspiration could be considered.
