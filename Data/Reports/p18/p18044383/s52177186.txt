                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with pleural effusion and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads overlying the right
 atrium and ventricle is noted.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  The hila are within normal limits.
 
 There is likely a trace right pleural effusion. There is blunting of the left
 lateral costophrenic angle extending superiorly with a configuration
 suggesting component of effusion, potentially loculated or with associated
 pleural thickening.  Best seen on the lateral view is increased opacity seen
 posteriorly over the mid thoracic spine with a suspected air-fluid level
 superiorly.
 
 There is diffuse chronic interstitial abnormality which may reflect sequelae
 of underlying chronic lung disease or chronic pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Otherwise, there is no focal lung
 consolidation.  There is pleural parenchymal scarring at the lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right pleural effusion and suspected moderate left pleural effusion
 which may be loculated or associated with pleural thickening.
 2. Opacity seen posteriorly on the lateral view with a suspected air-fluid
 level raising possibility of a loculated hydropneumothorax.
 3. Diffuse pulmonary interstitial abnormality may reflect sequelae of chronic
 edema.  Currently, no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT suggested for further characterization.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:06 PM, 7 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
