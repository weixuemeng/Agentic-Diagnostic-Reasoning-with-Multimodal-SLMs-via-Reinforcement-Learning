 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Minimal linear opacities in the lung bases
 correspond with areas of dependent and subsegmental atelectasis seen on recent
 CT.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle corresponds with a known small
 right pleural effusion.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no
 confluent consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or
 overt pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable minimal right basilar atelectasis and small right pleural
 effusion as seen on recent CT.
