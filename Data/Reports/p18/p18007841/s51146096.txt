                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided back and rib pain after fall off chair.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky left lower lobe
 opacity is present along with a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  Mild irregularity of the 6 posterior left rib could indicate a
 nondisplaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible nondisplaced fracture of the left posterior 6th rib.  Left lower lobe
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.
 
 Consider dedicated rib series for further assessment for rib fractures.
