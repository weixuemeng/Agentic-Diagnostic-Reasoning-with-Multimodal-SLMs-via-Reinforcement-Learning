                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia  // eval for pna, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright radiograph of the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dense consolidations are noted in the retrocardiac left lung base, as well as
 ground-glass opacities within the left upper lung.  A mechanical heart valve
 is present, along with mild cardiomegaly and aortic calcifications.  Calcific
 densities also project over the cardiac silhouette, location of which is
 uncertain.  A left pleural effusion is likely.  The right hemi thorax is
 grossly clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal left lung consolidations and likely effusion, compatible with
 aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
