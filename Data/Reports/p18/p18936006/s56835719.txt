                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe sepsis, SBO.  // ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Compared with ___, there has been progressive opacification of the
 left lung, now with only a small residual area of aerated lung seen at the
 left lung apex.  There is probable slight shift of mediastinum to the left,
 similar to prior.  Appearance is not fully characterized, but suggests the
 presence of a large effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. 
 The left hemidiaphragm could be elevated.
 
 Right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or effusion. Atelectasis
 noted in the right cardiophrenic region.  There is slight upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 As before, the patient 's left elbow is flexed, with the hand overlying the
 lateral edge of the upper left chest.
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive opacification of the left lung, with leftward shift of the
 mediastinum again seen and with possible elevation left hemidiaphragm, all
 suggesting considerable left side volume loss.  Presence of a left-sided
 effusion is suspected.
 
 Interval improvement in degree of vascular plethora.  Aside from upper zone
 redistribution, doubt CHF.
 
 Right lung grossly clear.  Minimal atelectasis at the right cardiophrenic
 region is noted.
