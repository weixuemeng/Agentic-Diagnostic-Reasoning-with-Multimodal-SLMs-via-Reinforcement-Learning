                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is a patchy
 opacity obscuring the right heart border, probably reflecting slight
 opacification in the right middle lobe.  The lungs appear otherwise clear. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacity, probably due to minor atelectasis or
 scarring, although an infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 setting.  If available, comparison to prior radiographs might be helpful to
 determine chronicity if needed clinically.
