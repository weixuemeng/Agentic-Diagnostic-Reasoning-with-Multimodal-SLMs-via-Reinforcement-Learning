                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:17 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Urosepsis, left pleural effusion, recent thoracentesis attempt. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 10:16 a.m. today:
 
 There has been no interval change.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement, left lower
 lobe atelectasis and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are stable.  A small
 left pleural effusion could be present, based on the conventional radiographic
 appearance, but subsequent chest CT scanning showed no appreciable pleural
 fluid collection.  Right pleural surfaces are normal.  The heart is probably
 not enlarged, though the apex is obscured by abnormalities in the left
 hemithorax.
