                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of tremulousness and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with overlying left base atelectasis and
 possible small effusion.  Minimal right base atelectasis is seen.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette does not appear enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable aside from likely aortic arch
 calcification.
