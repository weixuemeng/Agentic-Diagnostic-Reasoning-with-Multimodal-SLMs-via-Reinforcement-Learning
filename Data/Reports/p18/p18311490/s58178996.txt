 HISTORY:  Chest pain and abnormal labs.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged with tortuous aortic contour. Multiple contours along the left heart
 border are seen, the medial most of which is of uncertain significance.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Given multiple contours along the
 left heart border, consider oblique radiographs for further assessment.
