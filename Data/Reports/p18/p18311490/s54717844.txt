                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  Assess for effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 removal of right internal jugular central venous catheter.  Median sternotomy
 wires are intact.  Lung volumes have improved with continued bibasilar
 opacities which could be atelectasis, but correlation for pneumonia is
 recommended due to the atypical appearance of the right base.  Left pleural
 effusion is small.  Enlarged cardiac size is stable. No pulmonary edema and
 improved pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrosternal opacity seen on the
 lateral view is likely post operative fluid or hematoma, unchanged. No acute
 pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia,
 correlation with clinical signs and symptoms is recommended. Small left
 pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
