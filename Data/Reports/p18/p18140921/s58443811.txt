                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Orogastric tube placement. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:04 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Orogastric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach.  The endotracheal
 tube and right-sided Port-A-Cath remain in unchanged positions.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcification
 noted at the aortic arch.  Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is
 likely due to supine positioning.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung
 bases.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Orogastric tube tip and side port within the stomach.
