                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:22.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 normal.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Lungs are mildly
 hyperinflated with streaky bibasilar opacities which may reflect atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.
