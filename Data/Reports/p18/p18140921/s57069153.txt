                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD, myasthenia,
 intubated.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tubes and lines are in unchanged position.  Bibasal opacities are slightly
 more pronounced on the current study and might reflect interval development of
 bibasal infection, but aspiration or just suboptimal inspiration might be
 another possibility, repeated radiograph later today is recommended.  No
 appreciable change/development of pleural effusion demonstrated.
