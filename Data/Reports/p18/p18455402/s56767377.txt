                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Scout view from prior CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The chest is hyperinflated. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities at both
 lung bases suggest dependent atelectasis, greater on the right than left, but
 appear somewhat striking on the lateral view and compared with the prior
 lateral scout view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy posterior basilar opacities probably due to atelectasis,
 although it is difficult to exclude an infectious process.
