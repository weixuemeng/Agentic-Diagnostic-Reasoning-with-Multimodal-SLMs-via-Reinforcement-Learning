                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and pleuritic pain.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with unremarkable cardiomediastinal contours.  There is an
 opacity in the left lung base adjacent to an elevated left hemidiaphragm,
 which is compatible with atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  No diffuse pulmonary abnormality is seen. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No radiopaque foreign bodies
 are present.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity adjacent to elevated left hemidiaphragm,
 compatible with atelectasis associated with an elevated left hemidiaphragm,
 but pneumonia is not excluded.
