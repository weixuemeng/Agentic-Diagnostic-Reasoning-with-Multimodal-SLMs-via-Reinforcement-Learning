 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube.  Please evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal portal supine chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest CT from ___, reference chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 6.0 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube likely terminates in the stomach.  Cervical spinal
 hardware is partially visualized.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
 reflective of known mediastinal fat as seen on the recent chest CT. There is a
 partially visualized left retrocardiac opacity, reflective of known left
 diaphragm elevation and volume loss.  The right lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 6.0 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 projecting over the left lower hemithorax with elevated left hemidiaphragm and
 the stomach in the lower chest.
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacity reflective of elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and volume loss.
