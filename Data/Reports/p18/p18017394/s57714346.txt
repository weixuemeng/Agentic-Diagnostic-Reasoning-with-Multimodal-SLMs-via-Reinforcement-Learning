 HISTORY:  Epigastric abdominal pain, tenderness to palpation over the
 epigastrium and right upper quadrant.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacity in the right
 middle lobe likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.  No free air is noted under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild right middle lobe atelectasis.  No free air under the diaphragms.
