                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is minimal streaky
 opacity in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis, but no focal
 consolidation is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
