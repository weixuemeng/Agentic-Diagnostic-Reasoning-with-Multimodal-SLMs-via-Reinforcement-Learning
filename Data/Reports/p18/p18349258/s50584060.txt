                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with myeloma, cough,sputum  // ?pneumonia     
 ?pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again multiple old
 healed rib fractures on the right with mild loss of height of a mid vertebral
 body cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 There is the vague suggestion of an opacification overlying the anterior third
 rib on the right. However, this most likely represents of a fortuitous
 combination of the rib and overlying pulmonary vessels. If there is any
 clinical suspicion for an abnormality in this region, an apical lordotic view
 could be obtained to exclude a parenchymal process.
