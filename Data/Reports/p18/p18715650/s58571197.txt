                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Reference chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary arteries remain prominent.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is not visualized.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 Previously seen scattered pulmonary nodules including a spiculated nodule in
 the left upper lobe are better demonstrated on the prior chest CT.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Again
 seen is herniation of the left inferior lung through a left inferolateral
 chest wall defect, better seen on the prior chest CT.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Deformity of the left distal clavicle is suggestive of
 prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little interval change compared to the prior study.  Severe
 cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Redemonstration of
 herniation of the left lung through an inferolateral left chest wall defect. 
 Scattered pulmonary nodules including a spiculated nodule in the left upper
 lobe are better visualized on prior CT.
