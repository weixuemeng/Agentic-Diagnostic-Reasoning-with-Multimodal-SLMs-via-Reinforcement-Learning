                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and known carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The upper mediastinal border
 shows a smooth convex contour, most often seen with tortuosity of great
 vessels, although not entirely specific.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is noted
 with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, mild in degree, suggesting volume
 loss.  There is also a patchy focal opacity projecting over the right lower
 lung with peribronchial cuffing.  It is difficult to exclude a pleural
 effusion on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Patchy basilar opacities, including volume loss at the left base and
 retrocardiac opacification.  This appearance could be seen with atelectasis or
 airway inflammation, but pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to evaluate
 further, if clinically indicated, preferably with standard PA and lateral
 technique if possible clinically.  
 
 2.  Convex contour to the right upper mediastinum, which is likely to reflect
 tortuosity of the great vessels.  However, given the setting of known
 malignancy it is difficult to exclude other etiology such as lymphadenopathy. 
 Accordingly, if available, direct comparison to earlier radiographs is
 suggested to assess for stability of this appearance.
