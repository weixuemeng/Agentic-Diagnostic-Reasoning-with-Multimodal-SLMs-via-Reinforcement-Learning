                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable mild hyperinflation, suggesting background COPD.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is patchy opacity in the right
 infrahilar/cardiophrenic region which may lie within the right middle lobe. 
 Minimal atelectasis noted at the left base.  No other infiltrate is
 identified. No frank consolidation.   No CHF or effusion.  Slight asymmetric
 pleural thickening noted at the right lung apex .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy opacity in right infrahilar region could represent an early
 pneumonic infiltrate.  Recommend followup radiograph after resolution of acute
 symptoms to confirm resolution of the radiographic findings.
 2. Background hyperinflation noted.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend followup radiograph after resolution of acute
 symptoms to confirm resolution of the radiographic findings.
