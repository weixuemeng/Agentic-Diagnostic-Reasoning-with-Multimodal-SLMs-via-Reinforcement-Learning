                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rales 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable chest radiograph.  The lungs are well expanded.  Reticular
 opacities predominantly involve the right base.  There is no consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.  The trachea is deviated
 leftward by the thyroid and rightward by the calcified aortic arch.
 
 A one cm. nodule in the right apex; to determine whether it is calcified, and
 part of a region of scarring, would require CT scanning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Chronic lung disease--___ and/or bronchiectasis.  
 2. Right upper lobe lung nodule, nature indeterminate, needs further imaging.
 
 2. No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
