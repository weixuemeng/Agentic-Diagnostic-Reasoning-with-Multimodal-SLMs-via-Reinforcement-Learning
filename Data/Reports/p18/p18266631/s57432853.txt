                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and new onset atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Multiple masses are
 demonstrated within the lung bases, the largest within the medial aspect of
 the right lung base measuring up to 3.7 cm.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Streaky opacity within the right lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple masses in the lungs concerning for metastatic disease. 
 A CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation if no prior studies
 are available for comparison.
