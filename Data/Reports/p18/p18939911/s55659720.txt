                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post AVR/TVR/CABG.  Evaluation for
 postoperative changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of
 right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter.  There is also a substantial left
 pleural effusion which is increased since the prior study with elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  A small right pleural effusion is also noted.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period.  There is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Substantial left pleural effusion with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and small right pleural effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Followup radiographs are recommended for resolution of pleural
 effusions.
