                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever 
 
 COMPARISON:  For ___ 
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained, but are
 limited due to poor penetration likely in part due to body habitus.  The lungs
 are reasonably well expanded and clear with improved linear left midlung
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified on these
 limited films.  The cardiac silhouette remains mild to moderately enlarged
 with otherwise normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
