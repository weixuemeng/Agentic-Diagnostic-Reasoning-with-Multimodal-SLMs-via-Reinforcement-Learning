 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian central line, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right
 chest tube are unchanged in position.  Lung volumes remain low with streaky
 opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis.  There is been decrease
 in the amount of right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, although
 there is now lucency within the right paratracheal region which may reflect
 pneumomediastinum or possibly a loculated medial pneumothorax. This can be
 better assessed on followup imaging.  No pulmonary edema.
