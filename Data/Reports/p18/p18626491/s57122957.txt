                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recurrent bilateral
 pleural effusions and persistent shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis
 are noted, extensive associated with bilateral small pleural effusions, in
 part subpulmonic.  No definitive masses are demonstrated although cannot be
 entirely excluded.  There is no appreciable failure or interstitial
 abnormalities seen.  Further evaluation with chest CT might be considered.
