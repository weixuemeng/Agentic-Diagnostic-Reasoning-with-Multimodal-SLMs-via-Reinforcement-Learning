                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm limits evaluation of the
 cardiac silhouette; however, heart size appears normal with mild tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear. 
 Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Multiple healed
 rib fractures appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  
 2.  Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm may be related to prior trauma
 as evidenced by multiple healed left sided rib fractures.
