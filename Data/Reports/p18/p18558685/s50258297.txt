                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Left arm swelling after biopsy.  Question DVT or mass or
 compression.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from FDG PET imaging performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  As before, the
 left hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated in association with partial
 atelectasis of the left lower lobe basilar segments.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view depicts a parasternal mass
 effacing the usual expected anterior clear space.  Metastatic nodules are
 visible in each lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with metastatic disease.  Persistent left basilar
 atelectasis and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but no clearly acute
 findings.
