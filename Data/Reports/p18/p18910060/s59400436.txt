                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy, to assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Mild
 prominence of interstitial markings could reflect elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.  There is an area of increased
 opacification seen posteriorly at the base on the lateral view.  This is not
 definitely confirmed on the frontal image, though it could represent a region
 of atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
