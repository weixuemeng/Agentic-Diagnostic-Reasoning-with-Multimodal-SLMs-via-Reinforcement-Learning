                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and HCC with effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing right
 pleural effusion with extension into the minor fissure.  This is associated
 with substantial volume loss in the right lower lung.
 
 There is some vague increase in opacification in the left lower zone. 
 Although this is not definitely appreciated on the frontal view, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could represent an area of consolidation.
