                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatocellular carcinoma, ascites with shortness of breath and
 increasing distention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Limited CT abdomen obtained during an interventional procedure
 from ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is likely unchanged, though assessment is limited due to the
 presence of a moderate to large right pleural effusion, as noted on the prior
 CT.  There is adjacent right basilar compressive atelectasis.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable
 though the right hila is this partly obscured.  Left lung is grossly clear. 
 No left-sided pleural effusion is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion with associated right basilar
 compressive atelectasis.
