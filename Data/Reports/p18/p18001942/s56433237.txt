                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with unwitnessed fall yesterday
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta is markedly tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Calcified
 nodules within the left lower lobe appear unchanged, likely granulomas.  
 Streaky atelectasis is seen in the left lung base.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous structures are
 diffusely demineralized with mild compression deformity of to vertebral bodies
 at the thoracolumbar junction.  Soft tissue calcification adjacent to the left
 humeral head may reflect calcific tendinopathy. Deformity of the right eighth
 lateral rib appears to be new in the interval, likely a chronic rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
