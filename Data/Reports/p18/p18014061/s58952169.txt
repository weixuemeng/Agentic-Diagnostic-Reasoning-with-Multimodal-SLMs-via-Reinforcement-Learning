  rounded opacity projecting to the right of the spine is new and indeterminate
  etiology.  A lateral view may be helpful.  Stomach is distended with air.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged which may be accentuated by the low lung
 volumes in AP technique.  There is no focal consolidation seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The stomach is distended with air. Rounded
 opacity is seen over the right lower paraspinal region on the frontal view,
 which is nonspecific.  Differential considerations can include a prominent
 osteophyte, pulmonary vascular structure or paraspinal lesion.  Lateral and
 oblique views would be helpful for further evaluation and if its etiology
 remains unclear, chest CT.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 18:49 on ___
