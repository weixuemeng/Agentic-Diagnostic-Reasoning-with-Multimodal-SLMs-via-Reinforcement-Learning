 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question stroke, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a very trace pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Aortic knob calcification is seen. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, very trace
 pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Aside from this, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process seen.
