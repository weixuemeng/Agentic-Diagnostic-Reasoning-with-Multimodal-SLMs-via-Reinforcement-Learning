                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  There is an ill-defined
 opacity in the right infrahilar region.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Convex right scoliosis is mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite pneumonia. Subtle right infrahilar opacity is likely due to
 summation of vessels and rib, but short-term follow up CXR may be helpful to
 exclude early pneumonia if there are infectious symptoms.
