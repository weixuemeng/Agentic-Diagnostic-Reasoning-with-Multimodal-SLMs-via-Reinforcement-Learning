                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 including calcification of the aortic arch and slightly prominent heart size,
 although probably overall within normal limits, but with a left ventricular
 configuration.  There is no clear evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There are patchy opacities in the left lower lobe, not present
 on earlier radiographs from ___ and increased from ___,
 superimposed on streaky lingular atelectasis.  However, there are no findings
 suggestive of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal left basilar opacity, which appears superimposed on
 preexisting lingular atelectasis and probably within the medial left lower
 lobe with air bronchograms.  Differential considerations, include included
 atelectasis; in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia is not excluded,
 however.  Correlation with other patient factors is suggested.
