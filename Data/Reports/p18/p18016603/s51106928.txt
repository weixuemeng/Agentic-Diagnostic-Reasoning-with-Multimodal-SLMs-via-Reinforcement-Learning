                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, dizziness, right leg swelling and pain.  Assess for
 acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is subsegmental left mid and
 lower lung linear atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed compared to the
 radiographs from ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Aortic calcifications are re-demonstrated.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are again seen.  Heterotopic
 calcification in the left cervical region could be within the left common
 carotid artery, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
