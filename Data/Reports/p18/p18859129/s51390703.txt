                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with large SAH  // Eval for aneurismal bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the diaphragm, out of the field of view, with side port likely in the
 proximal stomach.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are likely
 accentuated by a AP portable technique.
