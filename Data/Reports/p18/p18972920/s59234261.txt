                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nasogastric tube position.  Right PICC line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a
 nasogastric tube with the tip projecting over the stomach.  The proximal side
 port is poorly visualized but likely at the GE junction.  In order to position
 the proximal side port in the stomach, it should be advanced by no less than
 3-5 cm.  A right-sided PICC is seen in the low SVC.  Compared to the prior
 exam there has been interval decrease in lung volumes which exaggerates the
 heart size and vascular caliber.  No pleural abnormalities or other relevant
 change is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Nasogastric tube with tip projecting below the diaphragm in the gastric
 bubble.  In order to have the side port in the stomach, it should be advanced
 by no less than 3-5 cm.
 
 2. Right-sided PICC in the low SVC.
