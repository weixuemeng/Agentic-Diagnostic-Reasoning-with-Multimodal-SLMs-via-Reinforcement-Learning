                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased compared with the prior study causing
 bronchovascular crowding.  Chronic interstitial disease is similar.  Patient
 has known emphysema.  There is no new focal area of consolidation to suggest
 superimposed pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion, superimposed pulmonary
 edema, or pneumothorax.  A right pectoral Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
