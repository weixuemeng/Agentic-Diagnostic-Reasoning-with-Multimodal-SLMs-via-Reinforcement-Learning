 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:43 AM
  
  
  There are diffuse reticular interstitial opacities, unchanged in appearance in
  comparison to multiple prior studies, is consistent with underlying chronic
  interstitial lung disease.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect basilar
  atelectasis. Given degree of chronic interstitial lung abnormality common is
  difficult to exclude a subtle superimposed infectious process, however there
  is no focal lung consolidations seen.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular
  congestion.  Aortic arch calcifications are unchanged.  A left-sided PICC line
  terminates in the high right atrium, unchanged since prior.  Overall, little
  interval change since ___ at 15:48.
