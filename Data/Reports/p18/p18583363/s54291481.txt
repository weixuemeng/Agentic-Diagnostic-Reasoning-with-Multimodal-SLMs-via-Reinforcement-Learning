  1. Increased lung volumes compared with the prior study with persistent
  extensive chronic interstitial lung disease, right greater than left.
  2. Increased opacity in the lateral right mid lung may be related to
  asymmetric involvement of the chronic interstitial process or mild
  superimposed consolidation, depending on the clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML, pending new chemotherapy, CHF, now with
 emesis and persistent chronic cough  // ? aspiration, effusion, volume status 
 ? aspiration, effusion, volume status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  Chronic interstitial lung disease is again seen, more
 prominent on the right.
 Area of increased opacification in the right mid zone could merely represent
 asymmetry of interstitial fibrosis, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 it would be difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia.
