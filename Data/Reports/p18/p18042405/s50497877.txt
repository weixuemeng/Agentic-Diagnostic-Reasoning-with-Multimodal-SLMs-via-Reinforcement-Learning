                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Unresponsive.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated to the left.  Right apical opacity is again
 seen, similar to prior with some volume loss.  Hazy right base opacity has
 decreased in the interval.  Plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base has
 significantly decreased with only minimal residual remaining.  There is
 streaky opacity in the left infrahilar region which may represent vascular
 structures, although an underlying consolidation or aspiration is not
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
