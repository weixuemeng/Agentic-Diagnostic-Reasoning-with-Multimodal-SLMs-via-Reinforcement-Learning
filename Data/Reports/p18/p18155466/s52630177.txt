 shortness of breath, atypical chest pain and possible pneumonia on portable
 CXR  // please assess for pulmonary edema vs pneumonia     please assess for
 pulmonary edema vs pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:48 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More focal opacity in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe persists
 and is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Linear opacity at the left base
 on the frontal view is felt to likely reflect atelectasis. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema. The heart is enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion should also be considered. A left single lead
 pacer remains in place.  Increased soft tissue in the right paratracheal
 region may represent prominent vascular structures, although lymphadenopathy
 in this area cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.
