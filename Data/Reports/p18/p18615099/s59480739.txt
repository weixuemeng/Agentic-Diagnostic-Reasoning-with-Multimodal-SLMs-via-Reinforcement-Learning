                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Wheezing more than normal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is
 again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium
 and likely right ventricle.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 most consistent with a small left pleural effusion.  Left base opacity may be
 due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although consolidation
 is not excluded.  There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are similar
 compared to ___.  There is diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Left base
 opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 although consolidation is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
