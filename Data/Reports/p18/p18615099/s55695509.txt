                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia with increased lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in right atrium and
 right ventricle, unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is similar.  There is continued mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the prior exam. 
 Small layering bilateral pleural effusions also may be slightly decreased in
 the interval.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild to moderate congestive heart failure, slightly improved in the
 interval, with layering small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 2.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 Infection cannot be excluded.
