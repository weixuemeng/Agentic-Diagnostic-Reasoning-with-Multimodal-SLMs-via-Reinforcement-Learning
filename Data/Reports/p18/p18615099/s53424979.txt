                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is near-complete resolution of
 bilateral pleural effusions seen on ___ exam.  There is no pneumothorax
 or focal consolidation.  Streaky opacity in the left juxtahilar region along
 with mild prominence of the pulmonary vascularity likely reflects mild
 interstitial edema, which is improved compared to the prior study.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is slightly widened, which is most
 likely due to low lung volumes and patient positioning.  Post-surgical changes
 related to median sternotomy and CABG are again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, improved from the
 previous exam.  
 
 2.  Near-complete interval resolution of bilateral pleural effusions since
 ___.  
 
 3.  Prominent mediastinal silhouette is most likely due to low lung volumes
 and patient's positioning.  A repeat conventional PA and lateral radiographs
 will be helpful, when tolerated.
