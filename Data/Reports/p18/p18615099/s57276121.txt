                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Failure to thrive and frequent falls.  Question pneumonia or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  A widespread
 interstitial abnormality suggests mild vascular congestion.  Although there is
 increased relative opacification of the left mid lung compared to the right,
 an asymmetric pattern of pulmonary edema has been seen on prior radiographs
 such as ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of mild-to-moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
