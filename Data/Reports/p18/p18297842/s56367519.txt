                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with T9-___ fracture s/p fusion x2 now with L
 effusion s/p chest tube placement  // assess interval change     assess
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little interval change. 
 Left chest tube remains in place with the side-port apparently within the soft
 tissues adjacent to the chest wall.  Nevertheless, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 The bilateral basilar opacifications appear less prominent on the current
 study, raising the possibility of decreasing pleural effusions and compressive
 basilar atelectasis.  However, much of this apparent change could merely
 reflect a more upright position of the patient.
