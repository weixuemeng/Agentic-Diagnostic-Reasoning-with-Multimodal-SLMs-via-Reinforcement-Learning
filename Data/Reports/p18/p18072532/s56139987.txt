                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic pancreatic cancer, now with right flank
 pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are markedly decreased, which
 accentuate the interstitial lung markings due to bronchovascular crowding. 
 Within this limitation, there is subtly increased opacification of the left
 lung base with no correlate on the lateral radiograph which most likely
 represents atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is
 accentuated in the setting of low lung volumes but likely within normal
 limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased opacification in the left lung base in the
 setting of low lung volumes, most likely represents atelectasis.
