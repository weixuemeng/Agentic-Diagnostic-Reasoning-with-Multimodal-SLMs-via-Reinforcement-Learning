                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall.  Assess for fracture or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Diffuse basilar predominant reticular
 opacities are of uncertain etiology and could reflect chronic interstitial
 lung disease, pulmonary edema, or atypical infection.  Comparison with prior
 imaging would be helpful for further assessment.  Edema seems less likely
 given the lack of hilar and cardiac enlargement.  Biapical opacities with
 elevation of the bilateral hila, left greater than right, suggests scarring
 related to prior infection, possibly tuberculosis.   There is no pneumothorax.
 The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Healed right lower rib fractures are noted; no acute fracture is evident on
 this chest examination.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Basilar interstitial opacities of uncertain etiology, though likely
 atypical infection or chronic interstitial lung disease.  Correlation with
 prior imaging would be helpful.
 2.  Biapical scarring, left greater than right, possibly due to prior
 tuberculosis exposure.  
 3.  Heart size at the upper limits of normal.  
 4.  No pneumothorax or acute fracture.
