 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with grade v splenic lac s/p embolization now
 with altered mental status  // Pulmonary etiology?     Pulmonary etiology?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 02:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film dated ___ at 22:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have diminished with patchy opacities at both bases suggestive of
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, although aspiration or
 pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is likely a layering left effusion.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. There is crowding of the vasculature given the
 low lung volumes. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to
 assess given the diminished lung volumes and patient rotation. No pneumothorax
 is appreciated.
