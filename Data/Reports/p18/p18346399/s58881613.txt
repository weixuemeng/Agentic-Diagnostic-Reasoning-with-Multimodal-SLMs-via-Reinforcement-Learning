                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mantle cell lymphoma with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left PICC line is in the right atrium and retraction by 5.4 cm is
 recommended for proper positioning.  Retrocardiac opacity has increased in
 comparison to prior study and likely represents substantial volume loss of
 left lower lobe.  There is continued pulmonary venous engorgement.
 No pneumothorax is identified but there is a small left pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 There are however lucent foci under the right hemidiaphragm which raise
 suspicion for free air under the hemidiaphragm in the proper clinical setting.
 There continues to be dilatation of the small bowel with air as noted
 previously. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Left-sided PICC line terminates in the right atrium and retraction by 5.4
 cm is recommended for proper positioning.  
 
 2. Lucent foci are noted under the right hemidiaphragm and raise suspicion for
 free air in the proper clinical setting. Correlation with symptoms is
 recommended and a CT Abodmen may be performed for further assessment if
 necessary. 
 
 3. Retrocardiac opacity on the left has increased and likely represents
 atelectasis.
 
 4. Continued gasseous distention of the small bowel with air. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 10:45 am on ___.
