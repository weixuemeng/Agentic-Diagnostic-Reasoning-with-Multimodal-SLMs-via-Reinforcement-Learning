                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post EBUS of lung mass.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  A radiolucent line in the
 middle mediastinum seen in the lateral view suggests the presence of
 pneumomediastinum.  There is small right pleural effusion.  Right perihilar
 and right lower lobe masses are again seen, better evaluated in prior CT from
 ___.  The left lung is clear.
