                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with productive cough.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including the most recent PA lateral from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A very large hiatal hernia is once again seen.  At the left lower
 lung lung there is a streaky opacity which is likely atelectasis.  The right
 lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones appear grossly intact.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess secondary to the large
 hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe adjacent to the large
 hiatal hernia, most consistent with atelectasis.
