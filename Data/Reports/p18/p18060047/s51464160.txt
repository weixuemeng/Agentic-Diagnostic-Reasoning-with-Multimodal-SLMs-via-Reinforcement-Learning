                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A markedly enlarged hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged, and the aorta remains
 markedly tortuous.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of
 the hiatal hernia, but is likely mild to moderately enlarged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Streaky atelectasis is seen within the left lower lobe
 adjacent to the hiatal hernia.  Linear atelectasis is also noted within the
 right lung base.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 otherwise demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Markedly enlarged hiatal hernia.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality seen.
