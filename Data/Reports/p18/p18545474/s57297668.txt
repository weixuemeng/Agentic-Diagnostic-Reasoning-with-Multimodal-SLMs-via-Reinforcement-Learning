                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new delirium  // r/o pna      r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 18:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right lung remains over expanded and grossly clear. Small right-sided
 pulmonary nodules on CT ___ are not appreciated on the plain
 radiograph. The appearance of left hemithorax with opacity predominantly at
 the left base and associated nodular pleural opacity is unchanged and likely
 reflects a combination of the known left basilar mass and either loculated
 pleural fluid or pleural metastasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain shifted to the left.
 Spinal hardware is seen overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
