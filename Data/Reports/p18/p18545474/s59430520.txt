                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, lung CA evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and prior
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left basilar pigtail catheter has been removed and there has been interval
 reaccumulation of loculated left-sided pleural effusion, likely with mild
 superimposed atelectasis given left-sided volume loss.  The previously seen
 left basilar pneumothorax has resolved.  Parenchymal changes related to
 emphysema appear stable from prior studies without evidence of focal
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval reaccumulation of likely loculated left pleural effusion, likely
 with mild superimposed atelectasis.
 2. No pulmonary edema.
