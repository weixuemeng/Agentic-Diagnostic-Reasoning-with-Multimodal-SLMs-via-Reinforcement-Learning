 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:03 PM
  An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carinal. Streaky bibasilar
  opacities are most consistent with atelectasis. There is no evidence of
  pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is identified. An enteric tube appears
  to terminate within the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT, in icu  // Eval tube placement     
 Eval tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A large, ___ x 5 cm elliptical opacity projecting over the left lower lobe is
 unusual. It could be a lung mass, collapse, or pneumonia, and could also be a
 fissural pleural collection.  There is no evidence of pleural fluid elsewhere
 in the left chest.  Patient positioning is not careful enough to determine
 whether there is any volume loss to suggest a component of atelectasis.  Heart
 is normal size.  Right lung is clear.  ET tube is in standard placement and a
 nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
 Unless the physicians caring for this patient know the nature of the
 abnormality, I strongly recommend CT scanning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 9:58 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
