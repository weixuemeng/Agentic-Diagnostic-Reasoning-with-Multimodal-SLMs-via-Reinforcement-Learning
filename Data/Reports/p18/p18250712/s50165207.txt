                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement, question position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are noted.  An NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen,
 though its tip is excluded from view.  The endotracheal tube is seen with its
 tip residing approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is mild lower lobe opacity, which could represent atelectasis
 or aspiration.  Small bilateral effusions difficult to exclude.  No definite
 bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tubes and lines positioned appropriately.  Mild cardiomegaly with
 probable small effusions and lower lobe opacities, likely atelectasis or
 aspiration related.
