                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes are seen on the
 current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Hazy
 bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis and potentially scarring
 particularly on the left as seen on prior.  There is no effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but likely accentuated due to lower lung volumes.   No
 acute osseous abnormality detected.  Surgical clips seen in the upper right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
