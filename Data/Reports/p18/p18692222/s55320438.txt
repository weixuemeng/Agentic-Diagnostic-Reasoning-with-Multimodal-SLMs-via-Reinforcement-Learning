                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MDS, neutropenic with wet cough, low-grade fevers, crackles in left
 lower lung, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:30 p.m.
 
 Left-sided pacemaker-type device (apparently an ICD) is present, with lead
 tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified and
 minimally unfolded.  There are some patchy opacities at both lung bases, which
 have progressed compared with ___, and which could represent pneumonic
 infiltrates.    Minimal stranding in the lingula is likely also present. 
 Right upper zones remain clear. No CHF. Minimal blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
 
 
 A small density in the right upper zone overlying the right clavicle measures
 approximately 3.8 mm and could correspond to the nodular density seen on the
 ___ CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD and cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities in both lower lobes posteriorly, that could represent
 pneumonic infiltrates and that have progressed compared with the CXR from
 ___ at 18:30 p.m. Lingular stranding likely also present.  
 
 3.  Small nodular density (3.8 mm) right upper zone, likely corresponds to
 finding on the ___ CT scan.
