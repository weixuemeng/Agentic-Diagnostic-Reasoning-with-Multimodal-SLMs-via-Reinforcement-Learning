                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Gastric outlet obstruction, question NG tube in place.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  The lower right chest and diaphragm are excluded from
 the film.
 
 COMPARISON:  No ___ chest x-ray on PACS record for comparison.
 
 An NG type tube is present -- the tip extends beneath diaphragm and overlies
 the stomach.  A sideport, if present, is not distinctly visualized, but likely
 lies in the region of the GE junction.  Possible background hyperinflation. 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No overt CHF, frank consolidation, or gross left effusion
 identified.  
 
 Single right upper quadrant clip and also a right upper quadrant stent noted.
 The stent on today's exam appears different from the catheter seen on the
 ___ chest CT.
 
 Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and the left AC and glenohumeral
 joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 NG tube tip overlying stomach.  If a sideport is present, it likely lies in
 the region of GE junction.
