                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Linear bibasilar opacities
 are most suggestive of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic
 angles may be due atelectasis or small effusions.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Degenerative changes noted in the spine. 
 Surgical clips identified in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
