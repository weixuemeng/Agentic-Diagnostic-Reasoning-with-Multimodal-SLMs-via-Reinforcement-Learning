                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Streaky posterior opacity on the lateral view suggests minor atelectasis, but
 otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no definite acute disease.
