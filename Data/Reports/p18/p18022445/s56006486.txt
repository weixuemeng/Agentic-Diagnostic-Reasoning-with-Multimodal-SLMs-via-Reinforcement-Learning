                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___ at 0:42 and 2:07.
 CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is present in standard position. An enteric tube is present with
 tip in the upper stomach and side holes at the GE junction. A left axillary
 dual lead pacemaker is noted with tips terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  A 3.5 cm metallic foreign object with two
 linear components and two curvilinear components projects in the left mid lung
 just beneath the left mainstem bronchus. The lateral scout view from the
 outside hospital CT abdomen pelvis shows this object in an unexpected
 orientation for the left lower lobe bronchus. This object is definitely
 iatrogenic and suspected to be cardiac related.
 
 The heart size is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.  There is a layering moderate right
 pleural effusion.  The lungs are well-expanded.  Pulmonary edema is mild.
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube in acceptable position. Enteric tube should be advanced by several
 centimeters to ensure position of side holes within the stomach.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate right pleural effusion.
 3.  Internal iatrogenic implement projecting over the left mid lung medially,
 suspected to be cardiac in location.  Correlation with known cardiac history
 is advised.
