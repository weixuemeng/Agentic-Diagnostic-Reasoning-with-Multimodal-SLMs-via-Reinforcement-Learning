                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with abnormal CXR @ ___ ___  // nodular
 density R base
 
 COMPARISON:  The comparison is made with prior studies including ___. 
 This study from ___ is not available this time for correlation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a base 5 mm density in the left lateral mid chest on the PA view not
 well seen on the lateral view.  I suspect that this is overlap of the caudal
 margin of the scapula and adjacent rib.  No nodular densities are seen in the
 right base as noted in the indication for the exam.  I would recommend
 obtaining the prior films for correlation.  .
 There is no pneumothorax, effusion, or CHF.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  .  A reported of the above findings was sent by the non urgent
 critical result results dashboard ___ at 10:01 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
