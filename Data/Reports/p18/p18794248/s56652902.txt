                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory distress, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. CT Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina within the
 mid thoracic trachea.  There is a left chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip
 overlying the mid SVC.  A right chest cardiac device with associated single
 lead appears in grossly appropriate configuration.  An enteric tube courses
 inferiorly with distal tip projecting below the lower limit of the radiograph.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There are diffuse, bilateral
 nearly confluent multifocal airspace opacities.  There is likely a small to
 moderate left pleural effusion.  There may be a trace/small right pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral nearly confluent multifocal airspace opacities are
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia and/or superimposed multifocal
 metastases.
 2. Small to moderate left and trace right pleural effusion.
 3. Endotracheal tube, left chest Port-A-Cath, and enteric tube in satisfactory
 position.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
