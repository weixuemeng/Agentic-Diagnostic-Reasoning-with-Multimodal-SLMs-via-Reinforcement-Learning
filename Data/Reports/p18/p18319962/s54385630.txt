                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Correlation is made to prior
 frontal view from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  On the frontal view, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits, however.  On the lateral view, there is increased density
 projecting over the anterior mediastinum in the region of the arch.  Some of
 this may be technical in nature; however, given density is greater than
 expected, and more dense than the cardiac silhouette, repeat exam is suggested
 to exclude underlying lesion in the anterior mediastinum.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased density projecting over the anterior mediastinum on the
 lateral view, this could be potentially technical in nature; however, repeat
 lateral view is suggested to reevluate, otherwise CT scan may be indicated.
