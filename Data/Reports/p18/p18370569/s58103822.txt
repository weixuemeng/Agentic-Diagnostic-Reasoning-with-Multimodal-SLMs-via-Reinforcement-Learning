                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, neck trauma.  Rule out pneumothorax, evaluate ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal portable chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube terminates in the thoracic inlet, 11 cm above
 the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip is seen in
 the gastric fundus.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits. Linear bibasilar densities likely reflect atelectasis or
 aspration.  There is no pneumothorax or pnemomediastinum. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Nasotracheal tube terminates 11 cm above the carina, consider
 advancing at least 5 cm. No pneumothorax or pnemomediastinum. 
 
 Findings discussed in person with the trauma surgeon on ___ at 2:50 PM,
