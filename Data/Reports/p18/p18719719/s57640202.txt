 INDICATION:  Leg swelling.  Assess for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size
 is top normal. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly,
 which may be due to a small pleural effusion and/or thickening.  Pacemaker
 leads project over right atrium and ventricle.  Sternotomy wires are in place
 and appear intact.  Multiple surgical clips project over cardiac silhouette. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of CHF.
