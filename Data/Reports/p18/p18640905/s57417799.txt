 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  On the lateral images there is a small
 region of consolidation in the anterior aspect of the lower lobes. Lateral
 images also demonstrate a possible nodule above the aortic arch. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small region of consolidation in the anterior aspect of the lower lobes.
 
 2. Possible nodule above the aortic arch. Old studies would be helpful for
 comparison, but if these are unavailable CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
