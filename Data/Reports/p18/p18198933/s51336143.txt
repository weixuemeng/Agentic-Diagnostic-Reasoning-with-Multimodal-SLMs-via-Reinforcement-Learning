                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 The frontal radiograph is technically limited due to AP technique,
 semi-upright positioning and suboptimal exposure factors.
 
 Heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is no evidence of congestive
 heart failure, and no definite areas of consolidation to suggest the presence
 of pneumonia.  Persistent slight blunting of left costophrenic sulcus
 posteriorly which appears chronic compared to prior studies and favors pleural
 thickening over a small effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited radiograph demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia.
