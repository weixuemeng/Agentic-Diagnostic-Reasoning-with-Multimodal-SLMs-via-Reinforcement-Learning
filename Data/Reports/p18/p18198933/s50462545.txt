  Limited study (particularly lateral views given patient's inability raise his
  arms). Retrocardiac opacity is more pronounced than on prior studies but not
  well assessed on the lateral, and could reflect pneumonia. Right lung is clear
  without findings to suggest edema. Small left pleural effusion. Bilateral
  humeral fracture deformities again noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate persistent
 cardiomegaly.  An area of consolidation is present in the left retrocardiac
 region, and could potentially represent developing focus of pneumonia, given
 clinical suspicion for this entity.  There is also a probable small left
 pleural effusion.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of
 abnormalities involving the proximal right humerus which have previously been
 diagnosed as acute fracture superimposed upon chronic injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left retrocardiac consolidation concerning for developing
 pneumonia.  Probable small parapneumonic effusion.
