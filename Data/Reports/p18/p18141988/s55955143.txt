                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever and low white
 blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are
 slightly low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis seen.  Retrocardiac
 opacity could relate to atelectasis, although an early consolidation cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable and
 unremarkable.
