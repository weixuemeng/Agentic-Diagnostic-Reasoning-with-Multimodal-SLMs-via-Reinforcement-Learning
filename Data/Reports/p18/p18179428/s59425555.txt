                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest is reviewed.  There is a right-sided chest tube with tip
 terminating in the lung apex.  There is subcutaneous edema near the entry site
 of the chest tube. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which
 appears worsened compared to the prior study. There is a small right effusion
 with bibasilar opacities, more pronounced on the right.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax grossly detected. No
 displaced fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right pleural effusion with bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis,
 though aspiration or contusion is not excluded. No pneumothorax grossly
 detected.
