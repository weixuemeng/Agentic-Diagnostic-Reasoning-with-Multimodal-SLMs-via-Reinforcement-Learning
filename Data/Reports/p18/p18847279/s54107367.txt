                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is further
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, some of which may relate to lower lung
 volumes.  In addition, there is pulmonary edema as suggested clinically. 
 Small pleural effusions are probably present bilaterally.
 
 The overall appearance is somewhat limited due to scattered radiation related
 to the size of the patient.  Of incidental note is a right total shoulder
 arthroplasty.
