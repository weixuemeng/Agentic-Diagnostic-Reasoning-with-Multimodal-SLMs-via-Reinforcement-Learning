 level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over the distal SVC.

 the abdomen and pelvis performed earlier today.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  The size the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 unchanged.
