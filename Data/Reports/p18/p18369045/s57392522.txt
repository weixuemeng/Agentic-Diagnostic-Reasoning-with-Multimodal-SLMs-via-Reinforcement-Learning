 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with conspicuity of vascular markings,

 projecting over the cardiophrenic angle, unchanged since at least ___.  No
 other focal opacities are seen.  The cardiac size is top normal.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
