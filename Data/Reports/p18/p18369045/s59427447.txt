                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia and crackles.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ as well as chest CT from that day
 and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Focal opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is compatible
 with fat pad identified on prior CT.  More vertically oriented opacities seen
 laterally in the right lung may be due to atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation worrisome for infection.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications identified at the aortic arch. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation without superimposed acute consolidation.
