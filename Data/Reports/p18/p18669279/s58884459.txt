                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypertension.  Question effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  There is left basilar opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm compatible with effusion with possible underlying airspace
 disease.  Given lower lung volumes on the current exam, the lungs elsewhere
 remain grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially stable as are the
 osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with a new left-sided effusion with possible
 underlying atelectasis or airspace disease.
