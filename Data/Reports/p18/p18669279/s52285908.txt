                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, status post thoracocentesis, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after left
 thoracocentesis.  There is no evidence of left pneumothorax.  The pre-existing
 left pleural effusion has substantially decreased in extent.  A small pleural
 effusion, limited to the costophrenic sinus, is still present.  Minor
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the
 right lung are unremarkable.
