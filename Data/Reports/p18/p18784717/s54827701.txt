 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart size is top
 normal but unchanged.  Large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are again seen.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 could suggest a trace left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Compression deformity of a lower
 thoracic vertebral body is age indeterminate.  A VP shunt catheter is seen
 coursing along the right neck and anterior right chest wall. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and possible small left pleural effusion.  Age
 indeterminate compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
