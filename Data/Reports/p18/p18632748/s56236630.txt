                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible posterior transient ischemic attack and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is an irregular density that is new
 over the short interval projecting over the left upper lobe but only on the
 frontal view suggesting an artifact; a repeat view was performed with a hair
 clip removed, showing the area to be clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.
