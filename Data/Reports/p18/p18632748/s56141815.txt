                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is subtle
 opacity seen over the right lower lung, which could represent a very early
 right lower lobe pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with an
 unfolded thoracic aorta again noted.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the right lung base could represent an early
 right lower lobe pneumonia.
