 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with increased engorgement of ill-defined vessels
 consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  However, there is also
 some coalescence of opacification, especially at the left base (though some of
 this could represent overlying soft tissues) that would be worrisome for
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Cervical fusion device is again seen.
