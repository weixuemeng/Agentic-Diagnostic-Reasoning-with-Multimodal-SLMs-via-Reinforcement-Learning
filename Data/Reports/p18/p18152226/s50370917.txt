                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT, evaluate placement of NGT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ and
 CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new NG tube courses through a tortuous esophagus and terminates below the
 diaphragm, likely within the gastric fundus.  The side port remains within the
 distal esophagus and the tube should be advanced approximately 8 cm for
 optimal placement.  Decreased lung volumes compared to the recent prior study
 are associated with increased bibasilar opacities likely a combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Superimposed consolidation is possible.  A
 curvilinear calcific density along the right heart border corresponds to a
 calcified ascending aorta and based on comparison to the ___ CTA.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New NG tube terminates in the proximal stomach and should be advanced 8 cm
 for optimal placement.
 2. Increased bibasilar opacification likely related to decreased lung volumes
 and a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Superimposed
 consolidation is possible.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:20 AM, 1 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
