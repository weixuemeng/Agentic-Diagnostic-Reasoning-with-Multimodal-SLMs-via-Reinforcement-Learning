                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inferior aspect of the left hemithorax is not fully included on the image.
 Given this, small bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to exclude, as is
 left basilar atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and not
 fully imaged.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study as the inferior left hemithorax is not fully included on the
 image.  Difficult to exclude small pleural effusions.  Mildly enlarged cardiac
 silhouette is not fully imaged.  Relatively low lung volumes.
