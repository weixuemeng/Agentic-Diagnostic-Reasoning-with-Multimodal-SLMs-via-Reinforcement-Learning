  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity, which could represent atelectasis or
  consolidation. Apparent mediastinal widening which could be related to
  positioning, but can be further assessed if clinically indicated.  Consider
  repeat exam with PA and lateral views at full inspiration and upright position
  to confirm findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with left flank pain.  Question acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT abdomen and pelvis from the same
 day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent
 cardiomegaly, which is likely accentuated by AP technique.  There is apparent
 widening of the mediastinum, more pronounced as compared to prior exam, which
 could be attributed to potentially semi-supine positioning accentuating
 mediastinal fat.  The lungs are reasonably aerated allowing for
 underpenetration.  There is no pneumothorax, large effusion, or congestion. 
 There is ill defined retrocardiac opacity, which likely represents
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity, likely represents atelectasis
 as the CT of the abdomen and pelvis from the same day demonstrated clear
 lungs. Apparent mediastinal widening which could be related to positioning,
 but can be further assessed if clinically indicated.  Consider repeat exam
 with PA and lateral views at full inspiration and upright position to confirm
 findings.  
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ ___ phone at 10 p.m. on ___.
