                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pressure, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Opacity
 at the right cardiophrenic angle likely reflects crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  There may be bronchial wall thickening in the
 lower lobes.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
