                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall  // ? ptx, effusion, consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  NONE.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is normal size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.  Lungs are symmetrically expanded
 and clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Bones are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
 
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
