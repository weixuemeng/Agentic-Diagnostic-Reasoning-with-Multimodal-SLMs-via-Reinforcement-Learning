                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post bicycle crash, landed on
 right side, tension pneumothorax on scene, status post thoracocentesis and
 chest tube placement.  Assess for right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 Assess pneumothorax after placement of chest tube on water seal.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained on ___.  There is poor inspirational effort on
 today's examination, resulting in higher position of diaphragms and thereto
 related crowded appearance of pulmonary structures.  A right-sided chest tube
 remains in unchanged position, terminating in the apical area.  No
 pneumothorax can be identified.  The findings are unchanged in comparison with
 the preceding study.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Moderately
 congestive vascular pattern exists as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of pneumothorax with
 right-sided chest tube in place.
