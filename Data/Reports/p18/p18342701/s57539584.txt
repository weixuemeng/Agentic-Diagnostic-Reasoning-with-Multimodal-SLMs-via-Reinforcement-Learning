                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sudden onset shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities within the lung bases are
 consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.  There is evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion and central venous engorgement though no overt
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions are evident. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Top normal size of
 the cardiac silhouette may be partly related to the AP technique though could
 also be secondary to developing pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is evident.
 A large-bore left-sided hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium,
 unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema.  No large
 effusions.
 2.  No confluent consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
