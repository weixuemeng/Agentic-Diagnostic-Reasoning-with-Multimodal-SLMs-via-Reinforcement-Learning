                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates within the right
 atrium, unchanged.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits, and the heart size is normal.  Lungs are clear and remain
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal
 blunting of the left posterior costophrenic sulcus on the lateral view may
 suggest a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the right upper quadrant
 of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible tiny left pleural effusion.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
