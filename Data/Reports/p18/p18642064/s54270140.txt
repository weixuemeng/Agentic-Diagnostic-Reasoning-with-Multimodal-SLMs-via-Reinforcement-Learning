 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:55 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fall, question fracture.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 An AP upright and lateral image of the chest were obtained on ___ at
 12:55 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with a stably enlarged
 cardiac silhouette, which most likely reflects cardiomegaly, although
 pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There has been interval extubation and removal of a right internal
 jugular central line.  Lungs remain relatively lower in volume.  No focal
 airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  There are left-sided
 healed rib fractures involving the fifth and sixth posterolateral ribs.  No
 pulmonary edema is appreciated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
