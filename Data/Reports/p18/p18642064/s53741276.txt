                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated, sedated patient, with pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Severe pulmonary edema is only minimally improved.  Worse consolidation
 persist in the right upper lobe, consistent with asymmetric edema; I recommend
 evaluation of the mitral valve.
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Large right and moderate-to-large left pleural
 effusions are grossly unchanged along with difference in positioning of the
 patient.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium.  ET tube is in
 standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
