 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 4.7 cm above the carina.  Right IJ line tip has been
 pulled back slightly and is now just above the cavoatrial junction.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right and bilateral alveolar,
 slightly nodular infiltrate.  There is dense retrocardiac opacity, consistent
 with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  The overlying impression is that of
 worsening CHF.  An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
