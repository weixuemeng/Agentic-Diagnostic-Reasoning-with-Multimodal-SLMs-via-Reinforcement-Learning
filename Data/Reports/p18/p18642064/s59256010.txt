                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory distress with possible ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 substantial decrease in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  The
 rapidity of the course suggests that this primarily represented pulmonary
 edema.  However, some element of superimposed pneumonia or ARDS would have to
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
