 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams  // please eval for infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there is central pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema.No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable given differences in technique and
 inspiration..
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there may be central vascular engorgement, mild vascular congestion without
 overt pulmonary edema.  No lobar consolidation.
