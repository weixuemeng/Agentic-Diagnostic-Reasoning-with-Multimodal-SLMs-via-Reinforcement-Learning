                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Concern for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ (same day) at 1 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning, similar to prior study.  Suspect background COPD, with
 prominent cardiomegaly, though the cardiac contours are difficult to assess
 due to patient rotation.  There is upper zone redistribution, similar to the
 prior study, without overt CHF.  There is atelectasis at the left base, also
 similar to the prior study.  Possibility of small effusions is difficult to
 exclude.  Radiopaque segment of tubing overlies the upper abdomen immediately
 to left of midline, not fully evaluated.  No obvious pneumothorax is detected.
 Clips again seen overlying the neck bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall similar to film obtained at 1 a.m. the same day.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
