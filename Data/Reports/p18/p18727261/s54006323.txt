                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post bronchoscopy and biopsy.  Admitted
 for low saturation.  Evaluation for atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is
 opacification of the right middle lobe, which obscures the right heart border.
 This likely represents known right lung mass obstructing the right middle lobe
 bronchus with associated right middle lobe collapse.  The left lung is grossly
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right lower tracheal
 adenopathy is present.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Right middle lobe collapse secondary to known obstructing right
 lung mass.  Right paratracheal adenopathy.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ page at
