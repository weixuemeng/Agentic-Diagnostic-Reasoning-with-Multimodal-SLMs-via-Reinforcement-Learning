                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with lung CA, COPD, worsening dyspnea/hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath resides over the
 right chest wall with catheter tip in the low SVC region. Upper lobe lucency
 is compatible with known emphysema. There is a linear scarring in the right
 lower lung. Left lung base is poorly assessed on the frontal projection with
 mild bronchiectasis noted on the lateral view. Difficult to exclude a lower
 lobe pneumonia given underpenetrated technique on the frontal view. No large
 effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with emphysema and linear scarring in the right lower lung. No
 overt signs of pneumonia though evaluation is limited.
