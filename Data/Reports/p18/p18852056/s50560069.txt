                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with possible MAC, RUL nodules  // can these
 opacities be seen on CXR for monitoring?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest CT.
 Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  Two discrete nodules in the right upper lobe measure
 up to 7 mm and are better characterized on same-day CT as infectious nodules
 due to mycobacterial infection.  Reticular opacities in this area likely
 reflect bronchiolar wall thickening and mild bronchiectasis, better
 characterized on same-day CT.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Two discrete right upper lobe nodules are consistent with atypical
 mycobacterial infection, better characterized on same-day CT.
 2. Reticular opacities, predominantly within the right upper lobe, suggest
 bronchiolar wall thickening and mild bronchiectasis, better characterized on
 same-day CT.
