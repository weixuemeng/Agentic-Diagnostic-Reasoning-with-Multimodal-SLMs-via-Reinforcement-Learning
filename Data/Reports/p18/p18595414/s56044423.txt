                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable allowing for improved lung volumes
 on the current study compared with prior, within normal limits.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  New since the prior exam has a left mid lung hazy opacity which
 is concerning for developing infection.  Equivocal linear opacity in the right
 mid lung may reflect platelike atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a left
 pleural effusion.  Suggestion of right mid and lower lung lateral pleural
 thickening was not clearly seen on the prior, however this may be due to
 inter-examination differences in technique, possibly focal pleural thickening
 or trace pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left mid lung pneumonia.
 2. Right lateral pleural thickening versus a trace right pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 1:36 PM, 10 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
