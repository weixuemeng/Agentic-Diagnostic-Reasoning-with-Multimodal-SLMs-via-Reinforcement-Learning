                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after VATS due to pulmonary
 nodules and history of a gastric adenocarcinoma.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ obtained at 8:51 p.m.
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax appears to be unchanged.  No changes noted in
 the rest of the examination including cardiomediastinal silhouette, pulmonary
 nodules, and bibasal atelectasis, although slight improvement in the right
 basal aeration demonstrated.  Minimal amount of pleural effusion is most
 likely present.
