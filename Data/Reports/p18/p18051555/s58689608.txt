 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 There is a very small right pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  Right
 surgical chain is noted.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Multiple
 lung nodules are better seen in prior CT.  Atelectasis in the lower lobes have
 improved, still larger on the left side.  There is no pleural effusion.
