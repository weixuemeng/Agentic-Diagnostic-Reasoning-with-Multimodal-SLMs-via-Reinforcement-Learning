                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is obliquity of the patient on all
 images, which somewhat obscures detail.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper
 limits of normal in size and there is some tortuosity of the aorta.  No
 definite pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  There
 is some elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour on all images.
