                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever and s/p central line  // eval central line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a left-sided internal jugular central venous line with
 the tip projecting over the expected location of the superior SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are mildly decreased leading to crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Mild-pulmonary edema and central pulmonary
 vascular congestion is grossly unchanged.  Probable trace right pleural
 effusion.  Bibasilar opacities are noted which likely represent atelectasis. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Status post left IJ CVL placement.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection is difficult to exclude.
