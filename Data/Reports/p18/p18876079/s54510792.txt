 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction/ right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen although a very trace pleural effusion is difficult
 to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Retrocardiac opacity best seen on the lateral view could be due to
 atelectasis or vascular structures, however, consolidation is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
