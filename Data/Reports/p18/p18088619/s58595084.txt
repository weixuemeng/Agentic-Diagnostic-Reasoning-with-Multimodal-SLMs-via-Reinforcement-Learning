                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dementia, found walking outside. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal cardiac
 silhouette allowing for low lung volumes but vascular engorgement ant and mild
 basal edema reflect cardiac decompensation.  The thoracic aorta is unfolded
 with dense arch calcifications.  The lung volumes are low, accentuating
 bronchovascular crowding.  However, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild heart failure. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by
 telephone at the time of report approval.  Low lung volumes.
