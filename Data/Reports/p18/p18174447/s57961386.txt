                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Long history of tobacco abuse, evidence of lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of high lung volumes, associated with minimal decrease in right apical lung
 structure and flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  Overall, these findings would
 be consistent with pulmonary emphysema and mild overinflation.
 
 Unchanged bilateral apical thickening with minimal dot-like calcifications. 
 No other acute parenchymal change, in particular no evidence of recent
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
