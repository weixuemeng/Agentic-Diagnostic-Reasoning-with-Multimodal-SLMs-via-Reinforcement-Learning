                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the thorax is slightly limited by patient rotation and low lung
 volumes.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Multiple remote left-sided rib fractures are again noted, and spinal fusion
 hardware spanning the cervicothoracic junction as well as within the lumbar
 spine is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the upper SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
