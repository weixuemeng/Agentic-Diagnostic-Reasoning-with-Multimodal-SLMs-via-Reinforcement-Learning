                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with nonprod cough and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity is noted in the left
 lung base, which may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  Right
 lung is clear.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present, though the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
