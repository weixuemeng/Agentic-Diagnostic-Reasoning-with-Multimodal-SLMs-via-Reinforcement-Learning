                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain since yesterday.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  A vague opacity to the left
 of the left heart border in the left lower lung could represent atelectasis,
 though technique is suboptimal.  The right lung is clear.  No bony
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the left lateral lung base could be artifactual
 or due to atelectasis.  Consider repeat with more optimized inspiratory effort
 to resolve this finding.
