                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier the same day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, repeat requested with better inspiratory effort
 with concern for left lower lobe opacity.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The previously
 detected opacity in the left lower lobe has essentially resolved with minimal
 linear density in its place likely representing atelectasis.  No definite
 signs of pneumonia or CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
