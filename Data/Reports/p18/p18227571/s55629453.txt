                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are correlated to CT abdomen
 and pelvis from ___.  There is blunting of the left lateral and
 posterior costophrenic angle.  This is thought to represent only small
 effusion with possible component of pleural thickening or scarring. There is
 increased opacity projecting over the left lower lung which is likely in part
 due to calcified pleural plaques better seen on CT scan from ___. 
 The right lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Triple-lead
 pacing device along the left chest wall is noted as well as median sternotomy
 wires.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided pleural thickening and calcifications better seen on
 prior CT scan with possible underlying pleural effusion.  No definite
 underlying acute cardiopulmonary process.  Cardiomegaly.
