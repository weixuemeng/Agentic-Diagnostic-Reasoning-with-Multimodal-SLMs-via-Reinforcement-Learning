 INDICATION:  ___-year old man with glioblastoma, AMS and fever.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Increased opacities at the left
 lung base obscure the left cardiac border and are concerning for an infectious
 process involving the lingula.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. No definite pneumothorax. Left
 infusion port catheter is in unchanged position. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased left lung base opacities are concerning for an
 infectious process involving the lingula in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Close followup is recommended.
