                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GBM with fever, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 which may accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar
 opacifications, more prominent on the right, most likely reflect atelectasis. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia.
 
 The enteric tube has been removed.  The left central catheter again extends
 only to the brachiocephalic vein.
