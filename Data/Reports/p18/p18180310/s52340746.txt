                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient with glioblastoma and worsening encephalopathy,
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right PICC tip is in the
 upper-to-mid SVC.  Low lung volumes are unchanged.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm are stable.  Opacities in
 the left base have increased, more so laterally, worrisome for an infectious
 process given the clinical symptoms.  If any, there is a small left effusion.
