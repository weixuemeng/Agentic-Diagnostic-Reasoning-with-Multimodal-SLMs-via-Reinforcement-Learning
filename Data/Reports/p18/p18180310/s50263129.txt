                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration, to assess for consolidation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the outermost portion of the
 left hemithorax has been excluded from the image.  Again, there are low lung
 volumes with bibasilar atelectatic changes.  No definite pneumonia.
 
 Central catheter remains in unchanged position with possible kink in its most
 proximal portion.
 
 The proximal humerus on the right is visualized on this study and shows some
 amorphous calcifications, which could represent old healed bone infarct or
 even an enchondroma.
