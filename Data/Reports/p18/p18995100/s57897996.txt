                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bypass surgery, follow up
 atelectasis versus fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with three postoperative portable chest
 examinations of ___, ___, and ___ as well as the preoperative chest
 examination of ___.  On next previous portable examination
 identified mild and moderate-to-severe atelectasis on the lung bases have
 improved; however, the lateral view identifies a persistent left lower lobe
 infiltrate - atelectasis in the posterior segment.  Pleural effusion is
 minimal, as the posterior pleural sinus is only mildly blunted.  No other new
 infiltrates are seen.  All previously identified postoperative chest tubes
 have been removed.  When comparison is made with the preoperative PA and
 lateral chest examination, there is moderate postoperative enlargement of the
 heart contours consistent with the recent cardiac bypass surgery.  The
 pulmonary vascular pattern has not changed significantly, so that the question
 for fluid overload can be negated.  Basal atelectasis - infiltrates, more
 marked on the left base, are in regression and should not be related to fluid
 overload.  No pneumothorax is identified on either side.
