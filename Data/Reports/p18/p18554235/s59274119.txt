                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F intubated, transferred from OSH  // eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is 3.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube traverses below the
 diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach. The heart size is normal.
 There is mild left basilar atelectasis. Note is made of mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable. In the mid left hemithorax, there is an ill-defined opacity.
 There may be a small left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Enteric and ET tube are in appropriate position.
 2. Opacity in the mid left lung is concerning for pneumonia.  Left lung base
 consolidation may be atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
