 HISTORY:  ___ year-old female with fever, on chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lungs are clear.  Vague
 increased opacity at the left lung base only on the frontal view only is
 likely due to overlying soft tissues and confluence of shadows.  There is no
 effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Lower thoracic
 vertebroplasty changes are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
