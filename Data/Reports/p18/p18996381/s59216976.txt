                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemopneumothorax, chest tube on right  // eval
 hemopneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Lateral view of the chest from ___ at 07:21. No
 frontal view was provided.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of the right chest tube which terminates
 near the apex.  A small right pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There is a large
 right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally. Right basilar
 opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis. There is no mediastinal
 shift. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Left lung
 is essentially clear aside from minimal atelectasis at the left base.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube in place with small right apical pneumothorax.  Large
 pleural effusion (reportedly hemothorax) on the right, a component which is
 loculated laterally.  Right basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
