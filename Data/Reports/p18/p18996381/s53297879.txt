                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R VATS blebectomy  // ? ptx, tubes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 14:32
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in the left
 lung. However, gastric overinflation is newly occurred.  On the right, a new
 chest tube has been inserted.  This has caused clearing of the pre-existing
 right pleural effusion.  The minimal right postsurgical pneumothorax is
 unchanged. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists.
