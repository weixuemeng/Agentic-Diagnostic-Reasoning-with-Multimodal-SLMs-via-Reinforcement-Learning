 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to pleural
 thickening or very trace pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over the left
 aspect of the mediastinum.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
