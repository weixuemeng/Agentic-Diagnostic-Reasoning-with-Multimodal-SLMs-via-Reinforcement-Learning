                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP image of the chest was reviewed. ET tube and enteric
 tubes are in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Linear
 opacities at both lung bases, left greater than right, may represent
 atelectasis.   As the pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, these linear
 opacities may also represent a small amount of edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Support devices in standard positions.  
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis or developing edema. Repeat study recommended for
 continued assessment.
