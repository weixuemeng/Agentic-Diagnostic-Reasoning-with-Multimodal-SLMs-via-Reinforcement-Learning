                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with mental status change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal with a left ventricular
 predominance.  Aorta is slightly unfolded. Widening of the right paratracheal
 stripe may reflect tortuous vessels but lymphadenopathy is not excluded. No
 pulmonary edema is present. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is of unknown
 chronicity. Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, of unknown chronicity.  Widened right paratracheal stripe could
 reflect tortuous vessels though underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded.
 Consider repeat chest radiographic examination with improved inspiratory
 effort or chest CT.
