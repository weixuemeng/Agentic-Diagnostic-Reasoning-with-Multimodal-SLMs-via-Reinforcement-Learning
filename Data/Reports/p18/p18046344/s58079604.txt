                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post cholecystectomy, ERCP ___ now with
 severe pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, concern for pancreatitis,
 retained stone  // evaluate for at left pleural effusion, intra-abdominal free
 air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by low lung volumes and rotation of the
 patient.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Focal opacity is
 demonstrated within the medial right lung base which may reflect an area of
 atelectasis, but aspiration is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Gaseous distention of bowel loops are
 seen in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to patient rotation and low lung volumes.  Focal right medial
 lung base opacity which may reflect an area of atelectasis, but aspiration is
 not excluded.  No subdiaphragmatic free air or evidence for left pleural
 effusion.
