                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent oxygen requirement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  Bilateral
 interstitial opacities have potentially improved in the interim, consistent
 most likely with resolution of pulmonary edema.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal interstitial prominence still present that might be consistent with
 residual of interstitial pulmonary edema.
