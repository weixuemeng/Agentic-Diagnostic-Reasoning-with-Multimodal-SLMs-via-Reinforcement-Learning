                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  HIV, cough, chills, and right-sided rhonchi.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  On the
 lateral view, patchy posterior basilar opacity is seen, which could be due to
 pneumonia, not appreciated on the frontal view.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
