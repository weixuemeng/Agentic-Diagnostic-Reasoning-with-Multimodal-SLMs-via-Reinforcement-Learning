                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion, now s/p pleurex and
 chest tube  // bleeding? pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 INTERVAL REMOVAL OF ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE. LEFT CHEST TUBE REMAINS IN PLACE, WITH
 SMALL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND PROBABLE SMALL LOCULATED PNEUMOTHORAX ADJACENT
 TO THE CHEST TUBE. IMPROVING CONFLUENT OPACITY IN LEFT RETROCARDIAC REGION,
 BUT DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FOCUS OF AIRSPACE OPACITY IN THE LEFT APEX.
 CONSIDERING THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT, THIS MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS ACUTE
 ASPIRATION. FOLLOWUP RADIOGRAPHS MAY BE HELPFUL TO EXCLUDE DEVELOPING
 PNEUMONIA IN THIS REGION.
