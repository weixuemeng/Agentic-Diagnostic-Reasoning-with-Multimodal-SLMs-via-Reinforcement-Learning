                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Episode of unresponsiveness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Calcified
 left mid lung subcentimeter pulmonary nodule again seen, likely related to
 calcified granuloma.  There is a 6-mm nodular opacity projecting in the region
 of the anterior right fifth rib, which was not clearly seen on multiple recent
 prior studies and may be artifactual.  Oblique radiographs would help in
 confirmation.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
