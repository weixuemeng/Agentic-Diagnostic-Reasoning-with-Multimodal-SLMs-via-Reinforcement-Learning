                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with difficulty speaking.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study was not made available for my interpretation until
 today, ___.  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base is likely due to overlapping vascular
 structures.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  CT is more sensitive for
 detection of mass lesions.
