                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for fluid overload before transfusing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with engorgement of
 indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  The left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen, suggesting volume loss
 in the left lower lobe and possible left effusion.
