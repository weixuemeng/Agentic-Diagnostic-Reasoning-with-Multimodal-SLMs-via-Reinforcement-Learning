                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Status post CVA,
 PEA arrest.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was reviewed in comparison with most
 recent radiograph acquired ___ hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.3 cm from the carina and is
 appropriately positioned.  Orogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm; however, its distal end is of radiographic view.  Right internal
 jugular line extends to upper SVC.
 
 Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart, bilateral perihilar haze, prominent right
 pulmonary artery and diffuse lung haziness obscuring the bronchovascular
 marking suggest moderately severe pulmonary edema.  There are presumed small
 bilateral effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderately severe pulmonary edema.
