                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Right IJ has been removed.  Tracheostomy
 tube is in standard position.  There are persistent low lung volumes. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has increased.  Bilateral pleural effusions are more
 conspicuous than in prior study; this could be due to difference in
 positioning of the patient and are larger on the left side.  Bibasilar
 atelectases are grossly unchanged.
