                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with trachea, left lung opacities, interval
 changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderately diffuse left lung opacities have worsened whereas diffuse and mild
 right lung opacities are unchanged.  Top normal heart size is similar but over
 last 24 hours there is widening of the upper mediastinum and pulmonary hila
 suggesting increased mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased
 retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is also worse.
 Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Right PICC line tip is at lower
 SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Tracheostomy tube is in position.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Asymmetric left side more than right diffuse lung opacities,
 unchanged on the right side and worse on left, and widening of the upper
 mediastinum and prominent pulmonary vasculature which is new since ___
 suggest worsening of moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema .  Presumed small
 left pleural effusion is unchanged and left lower lung atelectasis has
 worsened over the same duration.
