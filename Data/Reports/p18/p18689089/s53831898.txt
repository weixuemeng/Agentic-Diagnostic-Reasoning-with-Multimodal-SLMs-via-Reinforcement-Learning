                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient is status post transduodenal ampullary resection with
 left pleural effusion.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Evaluation is limited
 due to patient's body habitus.  Lung volumes are low.  Left costophrenic angle
 is obscured, suggestive of small left pleural effusion and/or atelectasis,
 unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears widened, unchanged, which
 is likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax. 
 Interval removal of the nasoenteric tube.  Fixation hardware in the lower
 lumbar spine is noted.  The left shoulder joint prosthesis is in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison with ___ exam, there is no significant interval change in
 obscuration of left costophrenic angle, which likely represents small pleural
 effusion and/or atelectasis.
