                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with copd POD ___ s/p knee replacement  //
 increasing o2 requirement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and a new right perihilar
 opacity, likely due to asymmetrical edema, although aspiration and infectious
 pneumonia are additional considerations in the appropriate clinical settings. 
 Pre-existing bibasilar opacities have slightly improved in the interval and
 small bilateral pleural effusions are apparently new.
