                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia, renal failure. Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph was obtained.  There is diffuse airspace
 opacity within the lungs, radiating from the hila, most consistent with severe
 pulmonary edema.  The heart size is difficult to assess. The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  No definite pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary airspace opacity which may reflect severe
 pulmonary edema.
