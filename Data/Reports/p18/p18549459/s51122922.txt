 AP CHEST, 6:28 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema and hypoxemia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 8:19 a.m.
 
 The moderately-severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality only in the lower
 lungs has not changed appreciably since intubation.  Strong suggestion of,
 even with cavities, raises the possibility of septic emboli or other
 disseminated infection.  Heart size is top normal and mediastinal vasculature,
 which was minimally distended earlier, is no longer, and the pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Pleural effusion is small on the right, if any. 
 Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.  No
 pneumothorax.
