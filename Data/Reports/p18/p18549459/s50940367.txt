                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pain at insertion site of left tunneled internal jugular catheter
 with left hand swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lumen left internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminating in the upper atrium, as before.  The course of the catheter
 appears unchanged.  The heart is normal in size.  There is increased
 interstitial opacification, suggesting mild vascular congestion.  In the left
 lower lobe, a prominent flat but prominent opacity is most suggestive of
 atelectasis, although an infectious process is difficult to entirely exclude. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of central venous catheter.  Mild vascular
 congestion.  New left lower lobe opacification, not entirely specific, but
 most suggestive of atelectasis.
