                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal
 right atrium.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuates the size of the
 cardiac silhouette which is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There is mild crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  No pulmonary edema is detected.  Streaky and patchy left basilar
 opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky and patchy opacities in the left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
