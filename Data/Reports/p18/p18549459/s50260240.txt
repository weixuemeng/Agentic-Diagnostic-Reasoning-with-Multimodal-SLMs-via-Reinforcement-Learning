                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ESRD presents with hyperglycemia + lethargy. 
 // Possible infiltrate in L ling on ___.  Confirm possible pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 02:08, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes persists.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is re- demonstrated with probable mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, and are not substantially changed in the interval.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or definite large pneumothorax is seen. 
 Please note that the lung apices are somewhat obscured by the patient's neck
 soft tissues projecting over these regions.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with no substantial interval change from the previous exam. 
 Probable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis.
