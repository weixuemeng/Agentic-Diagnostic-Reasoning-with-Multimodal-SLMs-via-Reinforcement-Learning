                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of end-stage renal
 disease on dialysis, eight days, lower extremity edema, question fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of previously seen left-sided central venous dialysis
 catheter.  There has also been interval decrease in fluid overload, with the
 pulmonary vasculature now appearing within normal limits.  Projecting over the
 anterior right third rib, there is an ill-defined opacity which could be
 artifactual, although an early focus of consolidation is not excluded.  The
 remainder of lungs is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease/resolution fluid overload.  Ill-defined small
 opacity projecting over the anterior right third rib, measuring approximately
 1.2 cm, seen not clearly seen on prior studies, although an early focus of
 developing consolidation is not excluded.  Recommend followup to resolution.
