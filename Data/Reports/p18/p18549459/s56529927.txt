                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lumen of
 right-sided dialysis catheter is seen with leads extending to the cavoatrial
 junction and right atrium.  The cardiac silhouette remains top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable and unremarkable.  Slight
 prominence of the hila suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
