                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Marked interval improvement in bilateral diffuse alveolar
 opacities, consistent with resolving pulmonary edema in the setting of recent
 dialysis.  Residual edema affects the left lung to a slightly greater degree
 than the right.  Cardiac size has slightly decreased in size in the interval,
 and azygos vein distention has slightly decreased as well.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions persist.
