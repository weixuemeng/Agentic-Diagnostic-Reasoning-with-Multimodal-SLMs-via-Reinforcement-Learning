                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  There is a partially imaged ovoid lucency projecting over the medial
 proximal left humeral shaft, measuring approximately 5.4 X 0.9 cm.  This
 finding is not well assessed on this study and it is unclear whether this
 artifactual or a lucent bone lesion.  It is unlikely related to patient's
 trauma, however, recommend dedicated imaging of the left humerus, either today
 or in the near future for further evaluation (if this finding is not already
 known and imaged elsewhere).
