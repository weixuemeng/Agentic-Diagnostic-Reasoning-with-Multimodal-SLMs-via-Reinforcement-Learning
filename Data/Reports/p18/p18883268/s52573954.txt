                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, for pre-discharge evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Bibasilar opacification persists, more prominent on the left, with blunting of
 the costophrenic angles consistent with small pleural effusions.
