 left pleural effusion.  The lungs are otherwise clear, with interval
 improvement in interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are notable only for
 calcification of the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged moderate right and small left pleural effusion without
 evidence of pneumonia, and interval improvement in interstitial edema.
