                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  AV graft thrombosis, on hemodialysis.  Evaluate for possible
 fluid overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:  There is a small-to-moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. 
 There is little evidence of significant fluid overload apart from this, and
 there is no good evidence of peribronchial cuffing, no significant upper lobe
 blood venous diversion.  The left costophrenic sulcus appears reasonably
 sharp.  Heavy vascular calcification is noted.  There may be mild pulmonary
 hyperinflation.  Findings suggestive of syndesmophyte formation within the
 thoracic spine.  Heavy tracheobronchial calcification also seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Right-sided pleural effusion.  Otherwise, little evidence of
 fluid overload.
