                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Moderate mitral stenosis/ regurgitation, hypertension, atrial
 fibrillation, CHF admitted for dyspnea and chest pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged with tortuous, mildly calcified
 thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild cephalization
 of pulmonary vasculature without frank interstitial edema.  There is a
 moderate left-sided pleural effusion and a small right-sided effusion with
 adjacent compressive atelectasis.  There is prominent anterior calcification
 of the pericardium suggestive of constrictive pericarditis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, evidence of constrictive pericarditis with left
 moderate and small right pleural effusions.  No overt pulmonary edema.
