 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rheumatic heart disease, mixed mitral valve disease.  Dyspnea on
 exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pleural
 effusions have slightly improved, notably on the left.  However, bilateral
 effusions are still present.  There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases,
 notably on the left, but no other parenchymal opacities, notably
 non-suggesting pneumonia.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be
 enlarged.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
