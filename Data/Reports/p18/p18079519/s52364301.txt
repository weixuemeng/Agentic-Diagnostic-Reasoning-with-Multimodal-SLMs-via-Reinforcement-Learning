                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, post-operative day 3 post mitral valve
 replacement, chest tubes removed, evaluate for effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained six hours earlier during the same day.  During the latest
 examination interval, the bilateral chest tubes have been removed.  There
 remains a tiny less than 1 cm wide apical pneumothorax on the right side, but
 this finding has not increased after the chest tube removal.  No evidence of
 remaining pneumothorax on the left side.  The heart size appears unchanged and
 so is the position of the metallic components of the mitral valve prosthesis. 
 Comparison is also performed with the pre-operative chest examinations of ___ and ___.  The remaining heart size similar to what existed
 before.  The pulmonary congestive pattern has clearly improved with less
 marked distention of the pulmonary vasculature and absence of upper zone
 re-distribution pattern.  Also the pre-operatively existing pleural effusions
 have diminished whereas the evidence of pericardial calcifications in the
 lower and anterior area remains unchanged.  Persistent tiny right apical
 pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  No other new pulmonary abnormalities
 are noted. Almost complete disappearance of pleural effusions.
