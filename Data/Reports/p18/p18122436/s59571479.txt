 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.

 In comparison to chest x-ray from ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again seen are scattered areas of parenchymal scarring and
 predominantly left-sided subcentimeter calcified nodules, unchanged.  There is
 no evidence of new focal lung consolidation.  Hazy opacification of the
 lateral inferior lungs likely relates to overlying soft tissue.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes
 are stable and within normal limits.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Stable chronic findings, as detailed above.
