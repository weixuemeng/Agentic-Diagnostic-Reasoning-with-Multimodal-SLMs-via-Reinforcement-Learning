                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Heterogeneous,
 peribronchial densities are present in the right upper lung of unclear
 chronicity.  There are multiple, scattered, calcified appearing nodules
 bilaterally as well as multiple areas of scarring.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Heterogeneous peribronchial densities in the right upper lung of unclear
 chronicity which may represent infection or a chronic fibrotic process. 
 Comparison to recent examination, if available would be helpful.  If there is
 no prior available, further evaluation can be obtained with dedicated chest
 CT.
 
 2. Scattered parenchymal scarring and calcified appearing nodules of varying
 sizes which is likely chronic.  Comparison to prior examination for stability
 would be helpful.
