                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p right crani, s/p dobhoff placement.  //
 s/p Dobhoff placement      s/p Dobhoff placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to study of ___, this and placement of a Dobhoff tube
 with the opaque portion distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Nevertheless,
 it could be pushed forward several cm for optimal position.  The bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications appear less prominent, though this study was focused
 on the abdomen and a repeat chest x-ray would be necessary to properly
 evaluate the heart and lungs if clinically warranted.
