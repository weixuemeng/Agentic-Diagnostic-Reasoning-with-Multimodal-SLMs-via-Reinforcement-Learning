                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pressure, scrotal edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There
 is moderate pulmonary edema.  More focal opacities within the right medial
 lung base, retrocardiac region, and left upper lung field could reflect areas
 of infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal
 areas of opacification in the left upper lung field and both lung bases could
 reflect areas of pneumonia and followup radiographs are recommended after
 diuresis.
