                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with poorly controlled diabetes,
 evidence of diabetic nephropathy and CHF, preserved ejection fraction, who
 presents with left lower extremity dry gangrene following a chemical burn in
 ___, status post debridement, large effusion seen on recent CT scan,
 evaluate for CHF and pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Hazy basal densities
 obscure portions of cardiac contours.  However, at least moderate cardiac
 enlargement is likely to exist.  The pulmonary vasculature is congested with
 significant perivascular haze throughout.  On the left side, the diaphragm is
 obscured and the lateral pleural sinuses blunted, suggestive of pleural
 effusion.  The right-sided lateral pleural sinus is clear.  There is crowded
 appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the bases suggestive but not
 conclusive for bilateral pleural effusions.  A chest lateral projection would
 be helpful to clarify the question concerning the patient's bilateral pleural
 effusion.  Right-sided PICC line is again noted and still reaches rather far
 into the cardiac silhouette and pull back of the lumen by about 4 cm is
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and probably posterior
 located pleural effusions.  These findings matches those suggested by a recent
 abdominal CT.  Single AP chest view has limitations to identify
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions in the posterior compartments.
