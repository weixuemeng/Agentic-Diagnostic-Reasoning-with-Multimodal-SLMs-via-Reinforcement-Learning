                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous two-view
 chest x-ray from ___.  Exam is slightly limited secondary to
 patient body habitus.  There is hazy increased opacity at the left lung base
 which is likely due to overlying soft tissues and prominent pericardial fat
 pad.  There is no evidence of consolidation or effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Left shoulder arthroplasty is again seen
 in addition to hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
