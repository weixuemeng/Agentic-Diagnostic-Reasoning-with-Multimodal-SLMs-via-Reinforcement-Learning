                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  There is
 prominence of interstitial markings and a possible retrocardiac opacification.
 The heart is mildly enlarged and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Possible retrocardiac opacity could be prominent vessels but
 consolidation is not excluded and could represent pneumonia in the appropriate
 clincal setting. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence of
 the interstitial markings reflects normal physiological changes in this
 pregnant patient.
