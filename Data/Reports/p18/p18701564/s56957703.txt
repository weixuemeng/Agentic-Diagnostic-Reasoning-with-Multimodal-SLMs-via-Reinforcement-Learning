                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p mini MVR  // eval for pneumothorax with CT on
 waterseal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular sheath terminates in the upper SVC. A Swan-Ganz
 catheter terminates in the right ventricular outflow tract.  An endotracheal
 tube and enteric tube have been removed.  Right-sided chest tube is in stable
 position.
 
 No definite pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac silhouette is minimally
 enlarged, but stable from ___.  Diffusely increased density throughout the
 right lung and left lung (to a lesser degree) is likely related to the
 patient's recent extubation and a decrease in lung volumes. The stomach is
 overinflated status post enteric tube removal. No focal consolidation is
 identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite pneumothorax seen.  Increased density throughout the lungs is
 likely related to recent extubation and lower lung volumes.
