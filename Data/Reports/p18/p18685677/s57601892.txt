                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer and two brain mets, status
 post resection, now with fevers and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes on the frontal view.  Evidence of volume loss in
 the right upper lung is again seen, without retraction of the right hilum
 consistent with prior history of right upper lobectomy, similar in appearance
 as compared to the prior study, given differences in inspiration.  The left
 lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change given differences in lung volumes.
 Again seen postoperative changes involving the right hemithorax.
