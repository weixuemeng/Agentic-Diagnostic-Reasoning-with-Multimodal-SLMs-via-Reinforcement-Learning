 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently placed endotracheal tube is in standard position, with tip
 terminating about 4 cm above the carina.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits and without change.  New patchy bibasilar opacities
 probably represent atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are also evident, as well as moderate
 gastric distention in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
