                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on chemotherapy. 
 New cough, rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is an area
 of opacification that partially obscures the left heart border which is not
 well seen on the previous portable radiograph and is not confirmed on the
 lateral view of this study.  This finding may represent epicardial fat pad. 
 There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 previously seen Port-A-Cath and sternotomy wires are unchanged in position.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Opacification partially obscuring the left heart border may
 represent epicardial fat pad.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.
