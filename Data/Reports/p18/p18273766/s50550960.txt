                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and aortic
 valve replacement.  Heart is mildly enlarged, but stable in size.  Partial
 obscuration of the right heart border is similar in appearance to a chest
 radiograph from ___ and corresponds to an area of focal
 atelectasis or scarring in this region on prior PET-CT of ___. 
 Streaky linear areas of opacity corresponding to areas of bronchial wall
 thickening and linear atelectasis on prior CT are also similar.  No new areas
 of consolidation are evident within the lungs to suggest an acute pneumonia,
 and there are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
