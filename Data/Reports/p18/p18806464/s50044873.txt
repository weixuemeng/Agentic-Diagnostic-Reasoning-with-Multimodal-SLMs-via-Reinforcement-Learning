 reflect loculated pleural effusion versus lung consolidation.  Small amount of
 basal pleural effusion is demonstrated.  There is also basal opacity
 concerning for infectious process.  In the absence of the prior recent studies
 for comparison, no conclusions regarding the dynamic changes can be drawn.  
 
 Small amount of right pleural effusion is present as well.
