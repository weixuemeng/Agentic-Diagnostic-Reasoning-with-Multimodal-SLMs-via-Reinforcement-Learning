                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 much better inspiration.  Indeed, there is some flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms raising the possibility of chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size in a patient who has had
 previous CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  There is, however, some relatively coarse
 markings seen in the retrocardiac region.  It is unclear whether this could
 reflect some development of interval fibrosis or atelectasis.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could possibly represent a focus of
 developing infection.
