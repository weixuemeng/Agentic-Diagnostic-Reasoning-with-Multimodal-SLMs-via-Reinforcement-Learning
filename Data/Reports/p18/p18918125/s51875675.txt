                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 has been interval removal of a right PICC.  There is evidence of prior CABG
 including intact midline sternotomy wires and scattered mediastinal surgical
 clips.  Lung volumes are low, decreased compared to the prior study from
 ___.  There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Additionally, there are new dense opacities at
 the left lung base, possibly related to prominent vascular structures,
 although pneumonia is not excluded.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is not significantly changed.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Heterogeneous left lower lung opacities could be partially related to
 prominent pulmonary vasculature, although infection in this region is not
 excluded.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
