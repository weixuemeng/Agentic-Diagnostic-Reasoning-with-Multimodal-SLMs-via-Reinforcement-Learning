                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:11 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease.
 
 Coronary artery disease.  Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Although the right lower lobe is abnormal, its appearance has changed very
 little since ___ and it has been a site of recurrent peribronchial
 infiltration over the years.  Presence of new septal lines at the right base
 and persistence of those on the left suggests there may have been intercurrent
 pulmonary edema, probably resolving, since heart size is normal and
 mediastinal veins are not dilated.  Dialysis catheter ends in the right
 atrium.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Overall, findings do not
 suggest pneumonia or even appreciable aspiration.
