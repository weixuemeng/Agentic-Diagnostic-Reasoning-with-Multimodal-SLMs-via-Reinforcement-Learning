                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain.  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the upper right atrium.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for small
 differences in technique.  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence for free air. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or free air.
