 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient has been extubated since the previous exam.  The right
 hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.  There is a new retrocardiac
 density with volume loss, mostly compatible with atelectasis.  There is also a
 mild right lung base atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  New very mild left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Progression of the left lower lung atelectasis without other significant
 change.
