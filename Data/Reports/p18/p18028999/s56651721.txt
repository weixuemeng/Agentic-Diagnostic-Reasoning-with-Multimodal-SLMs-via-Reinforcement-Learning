                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 probably within normal limits within the limitations of technique.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is obscured suggesting a retrocardiac opacity and there is an
 accompanying pleural effusion which is hard to quantify.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity, not specific; although a pneumonia is difficult to
 exclude, commonly this type of appearance is associated with left basilar
 atelectasis.  Coinciding pleural effusion on the left.
