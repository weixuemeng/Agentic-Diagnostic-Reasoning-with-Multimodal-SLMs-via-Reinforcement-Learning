                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 08:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from
 the prior study.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable
 from the prior exam.  A left basal opacity is similar in character to the
 prior radiograph and likely represents a layering left pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax identified. The osseous
 structures are grossly normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity is consistent with a small to moderate left layering
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Infection in that area should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
