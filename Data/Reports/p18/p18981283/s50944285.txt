                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia  // evaluate
 for pleural effusion, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval increase in
 size of the layering bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
 There has been interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax. A left subclavian Port-A-Cath ends
 at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase in size of the layering bilateral pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Pneumonia would be obscured, if it was present.
 Recommend conventional PA and lateral radiographs for further assessment, or
 CT, if there is concern for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Interval increase in pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   These findings were discussed with Dr.  ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 9:21am on ___, approximately 90 minutes after discovery.
