                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulm effusion, pneumonia  // eval for
 interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the bases,
 consistent with substantial pleural effusions and underlying volume loss, is
 less prominent. However, this could well merely be a manifestation of a more
 upright position of the patient as indicated in the technologist note. As on
 the previous study, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult
 to exclude a superimposed pneumonia.
 The upper lungs are clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
