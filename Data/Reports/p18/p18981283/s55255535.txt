                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PMHx of Crohns s/p colectomy w/end
 ileostomy, PSC/AIH s/p OLD ___ on cyclosporine, hepatopulmonary syndrome on
 ___L baseline O2, fibromyalgia, and multiple recent admits here for pulm
 effusions, fluid overload and fever x 1. s/p thoracentesis in ICU on ___.  //
 Change in pleural effusion?   Change in pleural effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at
 the right base, consistent with re-accumulation of pleural fluid and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Increased retrocardiac opacification with
 poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the
 lower lobe and possible pleural fluid.  There is some engorgement of ill
 defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
