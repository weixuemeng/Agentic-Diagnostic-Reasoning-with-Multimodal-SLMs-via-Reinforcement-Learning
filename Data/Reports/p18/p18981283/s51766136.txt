                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath catheter remains in unchanged position, likely
 terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A right sided pleural effusion is
 unchanged. There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable right-sided pleural effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, a superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
