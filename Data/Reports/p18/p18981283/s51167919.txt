                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates immediately above the cavoatrial junction.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a new
 large lobular pleural-based opacity occupying the left mid to lower hemithorax
 suggesting an extensive loculated pleural effusion. There is a small
 free-flowing pleural effusion on the right although the right pleural effusion
 has decreased. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. Surgical clips project over
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest extensive new loculated pleural effusion in the left
 hemithorax. If needed clinically, evaluation with chest CT, preferably with
 intravenous contrast if feasible, could be helpful to assess further.
