                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness and hyperglycemia. Rule out an acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. Patchy opacity at the left lung base, best appreciated on the
 lateral view, is presumably atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged and unchanged. There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema. The aorta is calcified and tortuous, which results in
 rightward bowing of the trachea. Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar
 structures are unremarkable. Severe degenerative changes involve the
 glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
