                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right crackles, pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart
 is normal in size.  Minimal prominence of the right pulmonary hilum appears
 essentially stable allowing for slight differences in technique and may be
 slightly magnified given technique.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the
 aortic knob noted.  Bony structures are intact.  Arthropathy of the right AC
 joint is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Mild prominence of the right
 pulmonary hilum is likely attributable to technical factors, though consider a
 dedicated PA and lateral view to more fully assess.
