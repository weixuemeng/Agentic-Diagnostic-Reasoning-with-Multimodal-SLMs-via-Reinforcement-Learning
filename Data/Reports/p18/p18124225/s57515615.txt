                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left pneumothorax status post anterior
 pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph obtained same day approximately 3 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to radiograph obtained 3 hr prior, there is been interval
 placement of a left anterior pigtail catheter. Previously seen left
 pneumothorax is decreased in size though persistent. Low lung volumes as well
 as bibasilar streaky opacities are again identified, likely reflective of
 atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance.
 There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left anterior pigtail catheter. Prior seen left
 pneumothorax persistent though decreased in size.  No pleural effusion.
