                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fevers // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited by the patient body habitus.  Lung volumes are low. Increased
 interstitial markings reflects mild-to-moderate moderate moderate pulmonary
 edema.  No definite focal consolidations suggest a large pneumonia in
 background of edema and limited exam. No effusion or pneumothorax.   Minimal
 larger heart is also overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and moderate pulmonary edema.  A superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be excluded with these limitations.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Close follow-up with radiographs to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia if clinical concern is high.
