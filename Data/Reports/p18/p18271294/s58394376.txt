                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stab injury to the left flank.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A trauma board limits evaluation of these radiographs.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of
 the pulmonary vasculature.  The lungs are clear.  There is no definite
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions are seen.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Mediastinal contours are normal.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, of unknown chronicity.  No definite free air is seen within the
 abdomen on the supine radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 2.  No definite pneumoperitoneum, although evaluation is limited by supine
 technique.
