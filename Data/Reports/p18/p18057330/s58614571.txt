                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with diabetes, MI status post CABG, hypertension,
 now with new oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The study is suboptimal due to
 patient's positioning and exclusion of the portion of the right lateral chest.
 Since the prior study, there is mild enlargement of bilateral pleural
 effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left with compressive
 atelectasis of the lung bases.  The cardiomediastinal contours are stable, but
 less well evaluated on the current study.  Two disrupted upper sternotomy
 wires are unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral large effusions, slightly
 worse since the prior study with compressive bibasilar atelectasis.
