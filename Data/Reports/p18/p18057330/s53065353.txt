                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen
 bilaterally.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle and silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm suggestive of bilateral effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears enlarged, likely slightly accentuated by low inspiratory effort. 
 Median sternotomy wires are noted, now with a fracture of the top two wires. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of congestive failure with mild pulmonary
 edema and bilateral effusions.  Component of superimposed infection should be
 considered based on a clinical basis.
