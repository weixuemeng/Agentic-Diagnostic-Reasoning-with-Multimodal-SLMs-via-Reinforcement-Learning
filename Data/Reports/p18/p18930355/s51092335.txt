                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A moderate sized right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged compared
 to the prior exam.  Right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  Left lung base is not imaged in its entirety,
 but where seen, there is likely a retrocardiac opacity which may reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again demonstrated with associated
 calcifications.  No pneumothorax is identified, and no large left pleural
 effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent moderate size right pleural effusion. Bibasilar airspace opacities
 may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.
