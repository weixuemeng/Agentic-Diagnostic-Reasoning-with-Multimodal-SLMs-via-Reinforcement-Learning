                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Possible seizure, history of aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-erect frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 The lateral view was suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  Given this,
 there are low lung volumes.  There is a marked large right pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Left
 base retrocardiac opacities could relate to atelectasis, although underlying
 consolidation or small pleural effusions are not excluded.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess
 due to bibasilar opacities.  The aortic knob is calcified.
