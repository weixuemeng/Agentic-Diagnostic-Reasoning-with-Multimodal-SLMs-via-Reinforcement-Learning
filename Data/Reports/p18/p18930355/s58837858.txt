                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia and respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared to the most recent prior, there
 are new diffuse parenchymal opacities, septal thickening, and enlargement and
 indistinctness of the hila, findings compatible with superimposed severe acute
 pulmonary edema.  Consolidation within the right base secondary to probable
 pneumonia appears denser due to overlying edema.  There are increasing
 bilateral effusions.  Probable left basilar atelectasis is similar.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New superimposed severe pulmonary edema in a patient with known probable
 right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate-to-large.
