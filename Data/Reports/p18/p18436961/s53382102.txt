                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are low, which accentuates the size of the
 cardiac silhouette and prominence of the mediastinum.  Given this, the cardiac
 silhouette is likely stable.  There is slightly increased prominence of the
 right mediastinum, adjacent to level of right mainstem bronchus which may
 relate to low lung volumes vs unfolded and prominent ascending aorta vs lymph
 nodes.  There is increased airspace opacity in the left lung base on the
 frontal radiograph which may correspond to increased density projecting over
 the lower lobe on the lateral radiograph.  No significant pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The trachea is slightly deviated to the right from
 the prominent, unfolded thoracic aorta.  There is no free air beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Airspace opacity involving the left lower lobe may represent developing
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context. 
 
 2. Slight prominence of the right mediastinum may relate to low lung volumes,
 an unfolded ascending aorta or, alternatively, a soft tissue density such has
 lymphadenopathy.  Findings can be further evaluated on nonurgent chest CT.
