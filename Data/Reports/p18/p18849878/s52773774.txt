                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased weakness of unclear etiology, undergoing an infectious
 workup.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There may be slightly increased opacity of the right upper lobe,
 and there is diffusely increased opacity at on the lateral view, but these may
 be secondary to poor inspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacity of the right upper lobe on frontal view and diffusely
 increased opacity on lateral view may be secondary to poor inspiration. 
 Repeat frontal and lateral chest radiographs with an emphasis on inspiration
 may be helpful.
