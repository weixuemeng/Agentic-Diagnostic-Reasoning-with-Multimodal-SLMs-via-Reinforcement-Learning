                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Continued bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases, more prominent on the right.  The lucency in the upper mediastinum at
 the thoracic inlet again is seen, most likely reflecting dilatation of the
 trachea.  CT would be necessary if there is concern for a post-surgical
 complication.
