                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New chest tube removal, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 right-sided chest tube without development of pneumothorax.   Otherwise,
 examination is unchanged with bibasilar opacifications, right greater than
 left, likely reflecting atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  A post-thoracotomy
 rib fracture identified on the right.  Endotracheal tube has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube without development of
 pneumothorax.  Otherwise unchanged exam.
