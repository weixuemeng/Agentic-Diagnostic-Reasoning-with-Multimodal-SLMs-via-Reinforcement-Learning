                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT is available from ___, which showed tracheomegaly.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  The lung volumes are low with streaky
 basilar opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis.  Airways are not well
 assessed on this examination.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities and volume loss, most suggestive of
 atelectasis.
