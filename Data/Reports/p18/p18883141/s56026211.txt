                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post tracheobronchoplasty.  Check interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 As compared to prior, there is interval decrease in bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There are lenticular opacities at the right lung base which may
 represent areas of discoid atelectasis.  Small amounts of pleural fluid may
 still be present.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base.  Heart size
 is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lucency in the upper mediastinum above
 the level of thoracic inlet is unchanged and as before may reflect dilatation
 of trachea.
