                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with tracheobronchomegaly, multiple
 prior pneumonias status post bronch on ___, and worsening dyspnea. 
 Study requested for evaluation of pneumonia and/or other acute processes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTA and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung
 volumes remain low. There is increased retrocardiac density and increased
 density at the right lung base, most suggestive of atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Retrocardiac and right lung base densities, most suggestive of atelectasis.
 However, close monitoring is recommended. 
 
 2. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
