                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of intubated, question
 ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates just above the level of the carina, approximately 1 cm, and
 should be withdrawn by approximately 2 cm.  This finding and recommendation
 was discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:05 p.m. on ___ via telephone.
 Pulmonary edema is present, asymmetric, right greater than left, which may be
 neurogenic in origin.  The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on
 the image.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified
 and tortuous.  Nasogastric tube is seen, distal aspect not included on the
 image, but seen to course below the level of the diaphragm into the expected
 location of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low endotracheal tube, as above, recommend withdrawal by 2-3 cm.
 2.  Pulmonary edema, asymmetric, right greater than left, may be neurogenic in
 origin.
