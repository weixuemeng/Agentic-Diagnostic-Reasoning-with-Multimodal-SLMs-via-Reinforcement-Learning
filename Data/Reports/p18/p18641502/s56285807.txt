                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with bilateral lower extremity
 and scrotal edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.  The
 heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with
 calcification of the aortic knob noted.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 There is minimal atelectasis in the right lung base.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is visualized.  There are no pleural effusions.  Deformity of
 the right lateral 7th rib is likely related to a pathologic fracture through
 an osseous metastasis, unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 otherwise demonstrated.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild right basilar atelectasis.  Deformity of the right lateral 7th rib likely
 reflects a pathologic fracture through a known osseous metastasis, and appears
 unchanged.
