                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with active upper GI bleed requiring intubation
 and central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating at least 2.5 cm from the
 carina; however, neck is in flexion and position probably represents lowest
 point at expiration.  Right-sided large caliber catheter sheath is seen
 entering the right IJ and terminating within the upper SVC; there is severe
 kinking at its proximal end.  There are low lung volumes bilaterally, with
 bronchovascular crowding and diffuse haziness with perihilar fullness
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in
 size.  No pleural effusion is appreciated.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating at least 2.5 cm from the
 carina while neck is in flexion.  Right-sided catheter sheath is seen entering
 the right IJ and terminating within the superior vena cava.  Proximal end of
 this sheath is kinked.
 
 These findings were discussed with nurse, ___, at 3:05 p.m. by ___
 ___ via phone.
