                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Right subclavian central line, evaluation of position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new right-sided central venous access line.  The course of the line is
 unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC.  The previous
 right-sided central access line has been removed.  The nasogastric tube and
 the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position.
 
 The bilateral pleural effusions have minimally decreased, as have the
 severities of the accompanying areas of atelectasis.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged appearance of the hilar and mediastinal
 structures.
