  subtle patchy right upper lung opacity, also on prior.  in this patient with
  COPD/emphysema, if this has not been previously worked up, recommend nonurgent
  chest CT to assess for underlying lesion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, COPD, on home oxygen, at baseline.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 significant interval change since the prior study.  Subtle opacity is again
 seen projecting over the right upper lung, which is similar as compared to the
 prior study, slightly more apparent as compared to ___.  Given likely
 pulmonary emphysema in this patient, recommend followup chest CT for further
 evaluation.  Relative lucency projecting over the left upper-to-mid lung
 likely relates to pulmonary emphysema.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms consistent with COPD.  Right basilar opacity is
 slightly less confluent as compared to the prior study.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity projecting over the right upper lung in this
 patient with pulmonary emphysema, if this has not been further worked up,
 recommend non-urgent chest CT for further evaluation.  No definite new focal
 consolidation.
