 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary
 edema.  At the medial basal aspects of the right lung, a small region of
 peribronchial increase of interstitial structures is seen.  This could reflect
 local bronchiectasis.  Minimal scarring at the right upper lobe base.  No
 acute changes such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  No pleural effusions. 
 Bilateral apical thickening that is symmetrical in appearance.
