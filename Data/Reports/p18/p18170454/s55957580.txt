                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, congestive heart failure with hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, with vascular stents noted
 in the anterior mediastinum.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  Diffuse ill-defined nodular opacities are again noted,
 right greater than left, which appear perhaps minimally improved compared to
 the prior chest radiograph.  Bibasilar streaky opacities could reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may indicate
 pleural trace pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse ill-defined nodular opacities, slightly improved compared to the
 prior chest radiograph study.  Differential considerations include Langerhans
 cell histiocytosis if the patient is a smoker, infection including fungal
 organisms, or other inflammatory process.  Comparison with any prior chest CT
 imaging is recommended since ___, and if this has not been
 performed, then HRCT of the chest can be obtained for further assessment. 
 
 2.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are more focal compared to the prior study
 and could reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
