                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The lungs are
 hyperinflated. Opacity in the right medial lung is likely due to confluence of
 shadows, but could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Moderate aortic tortuosity is unchanged.
 Mediastinal silhouette with wires projecting over the manubrium are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right middle opacity may be early pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting. No edema or effusion.
 
 Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 7:55
 p.m., ___.
