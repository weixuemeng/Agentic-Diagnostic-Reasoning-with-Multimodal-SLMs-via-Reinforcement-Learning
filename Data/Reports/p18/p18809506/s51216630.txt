                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  An ___-year-old woman with dyspnea and lower extremity swelling,
 evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Surgical clips from prior thyroid surgery are again seen overlying the upper
 trachea.  Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable, demonstrating a tortuous thoracic aorta. In comparison
 to prior radiograph, there is a poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.
 Mild central and diffuse interstitial prominence potentially represents
 bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes. There is no focal
 lung consolidation. There is a trace right pleural effusion. There is no left
 pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild levoscoliosis of the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild central and diffuse interstitial prominence, potentially due to
 bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lungs volumes. Trace right
 pleural effusion. No focal consolidation.
