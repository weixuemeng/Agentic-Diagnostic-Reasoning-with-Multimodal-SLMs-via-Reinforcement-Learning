                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The bones are diffusely sclerotic worrisome for prostate cancer metastatic
 disease.  Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Diffuse heterogeneous
 osseous sclerosis suggests prostate cancer metastatic disease.
