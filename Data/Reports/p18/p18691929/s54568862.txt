                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L VATS wedge biopsy, CT removed  //
 Post-pull
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:41
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the left chest tube is been removed.  There is a
 new faint focal opacity at the left base laterally, measuring approximately
 2.7 cm in diameter which could reflect localized pleural fluid or pulmonary
 contusion.  No gross effusion and no obvious pneumothorax is detected. 
 Probable atelectasis at the left lung base.  The left hemidiaphragm is
 elevated, similar to prior.  Subcutaneous emphysema along the lower left chest
 wall is slightly increased.
 
 There is some residual atelectasis in the right mid zone, but upper zone
 atelectasis has cleared.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic
 region.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle but no gross
 effusion.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chest tube removed.  Small focal opacity left lung base laterally probably
 related to the chest tube site.  Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
 No obvious pneumothorax or gross effusion.
