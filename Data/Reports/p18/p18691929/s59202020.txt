                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, on chemo  // Evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  Right base opacity
 most likely relates to atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. No pleural effusion
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis/ scarring.  Increased opacity at the right lung base
 felt to more likely relate to atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
