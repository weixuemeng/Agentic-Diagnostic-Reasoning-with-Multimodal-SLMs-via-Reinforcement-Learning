                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated, slightly limiting the evaluation.  Multiple sternal
 wires and a cardiac valve are present.  There is no large consolidation and no
 pneumothorax. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could be
 due to a small left pleural effusion. The heart size is within normal limits. 
 Moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation. Equivocal small left pleural effusion, with
 examination limited by patient rotation.
