                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in an intubated patient.
 
 COMPARISON:  Torso radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and intact sternal wires.  There
 is moderate cardiomegaly and marked atherosclerotic calcification.  Increased
 bilateral opacities and obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with increased mild pulmonary edema and probable small pleural
 effusions, superimposed on background interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased mild pulmonary edema and probable small pleural effusions
 bilaterally, superimposed on background interstitial lung disease.
