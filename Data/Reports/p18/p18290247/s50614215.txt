                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Low lung volumes results in
 crowding of bronchovascular markings.  No overt pulmonary edema is present. 
 Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
