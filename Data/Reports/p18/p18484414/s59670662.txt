                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 There are good inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 There is very slight accentuated kyphosis in the upper/mid thoracic spine,
 with a combination of slight disc space narrowing anteriorly and possible
 minimal anterior wedging of a mid-thoracic vertebral body, ? T7.   No
 displaced rib fracture is detected on these lung-technique films.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1) No acute pulmonary process identified. In particular, no pneumothorax is
 detected. 
 
 2) Subtle changes in the thoracic spine, detailed above.
