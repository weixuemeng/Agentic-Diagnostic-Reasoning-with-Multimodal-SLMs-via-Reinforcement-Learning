                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p AAA repair  // eval for dobhoff tube tip
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___:41.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette unremarkable and unchanged.
 Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis may have improved slightly, and previous
 moderate left pleural effusion is smaller.
 
 A chin is flexed, so the proximity of the ET tube tip a to the carina,
 approximately 2 cm, is probably acceptable.
 
 Feeding tube, without awire stylet, passes into the stomach and out of view. 
 Right pleural drainage tube is still fissural, but I see no pneumothorax or
 evidence of pleural fluid accumulation in the right chest.
