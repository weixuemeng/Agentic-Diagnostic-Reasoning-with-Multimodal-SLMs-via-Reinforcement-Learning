                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe COPD and parapneumonic effusion with
 chest tube in place. Now with severe pain at chest tube site.  // Please
 evaluate for migration of chest tube, hemothorax, etc.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright frontal portable view radiograph chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right lung base pigtail catheter projects in unchanged location with a
 stable small right pleural effusion.  Volume loss of the right lung has
 increased with near complete right lower lobe opacification likely combination
 of consolidation and collapse.  Retrocardiac consolidation has increased. 
 Marked pulmonary arterial enlargement with mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or significant left-sided pleural
 effusion.  A right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 gaseous distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged position of right-sided chest tube compared with recent prior
 studies with an unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 2. Increasing opacification of bilateral lung bases is likely a combination of
 consolidation and collapse, either worsening pneumonia or aspiration in the
 setting of gaseous gastric distention.
