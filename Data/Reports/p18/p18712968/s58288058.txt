 Right hemi thorax is now completely opacified, and the trachea an upper

 has improved.  Pulmonary arteries are chronically enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right pigtail pleural drainage catheter still in place.  Right PIC line ends
 close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Findings were discussed by
