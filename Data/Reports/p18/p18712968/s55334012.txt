                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hepatocellular
 carcinoma after TACE yesterday and with history of pulmonary hypertension.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including right hilar and left
 hilar enlargement, consistent with massive pulmonary hypertension.  Lungs are
 overall clear.  Note is made of the presence of small amount of left pleural
 effusion and adjacent opacity that might potentially reflect atelectasis with
 subsequent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Left lower lobe partial atelectasis.
 
 Massive pulmonary hypertension.
