 evaluate for et tube placement, acute intrathoracic process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently 12:57 today.
 
 This radiograph was taken following bronchoscopic extraction of bronchial
 secretions, and placement of an ET tube in standard position.  Right middle
 lobe is partially aerated, but there is still complete collapse of the upper
 and lower lobes.  Downward bulging of the minor fissure suggests either
 bleeding in the upper lobe or mid fissural pleural collection.  Solitary
 pigtail pleural drainage catheter is still in place.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Left lung shows expected vascular congestion but is otherwise
 clear.  Heart is unchanged, moderately enlarged.  Pulmonary arteries are
 chronically enlarged.
 
 Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT scanning, with contrast agent if the patient can
 tolerate it, to localize fluid collections in the right hemi thorax,
 particularly blood, and assess the patency of the bronchial tree.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 3:57 PM, ___ min after the initial 2 pages placed immediately after
