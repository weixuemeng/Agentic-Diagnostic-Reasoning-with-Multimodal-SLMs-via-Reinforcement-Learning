                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left chest
 tube has been removed and there is no definite pneumothorax.  Right chest tube
 remains in place and there may be a minimal residual of pneumothorax on this
 side.  Otherwise, little change.
