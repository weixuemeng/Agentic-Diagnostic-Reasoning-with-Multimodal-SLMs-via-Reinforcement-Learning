 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight
 retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis.  There has been marked
 interval improvement in bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with
 improving pulmonary edema.  The mediastinum remains widened, although has
 decreased slightly in size as compared to the prior.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  A chest tube projects over the right
 hemithorax. There is a stent in the decending thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked interval improvement in now interstitial pulmonary edema.
