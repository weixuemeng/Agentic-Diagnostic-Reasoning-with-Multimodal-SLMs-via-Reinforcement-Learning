                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fevers and persistent pneumonia
 despite antibiotics.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate increased
 opacification of the left lower lobe since the prior study, consistent with
 worsening pneumonia.  The previously described subtle hazy opacity in the
 right lower lung is not as well visualized on today's exam.  The heart size is
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased consolidation in the left lower lobe, consistent with
 worsening pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs to document resolution after
 treatment are recommended.
