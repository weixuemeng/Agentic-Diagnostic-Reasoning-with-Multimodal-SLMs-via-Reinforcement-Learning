                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, rib pain, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large area of left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Subtle
 patchy opacity projecting over the right lung base at the level of where the
 anterior right sixth and posterior ninth ribs overlap may be due to
 overlapping structures; however, second small focus of consolidation is not
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen, although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to
 exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left lower lobe pneumonia.  Possible smaller focus of
 opacity in the right lung base, which could be due to overlapping structures
 or additional small focus of infection.  Recommend followup to resolution.
