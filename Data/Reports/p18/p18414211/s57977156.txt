                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L pleural effusion.  // Improvement of
 pleural effusion?      Improvement of pleural effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the hemidiaphragms and
 costophrenic angles are quite well seen posteriorly on the lateral view.  This
 suggests substantial improvement in the pleural effusions.  The blunting of
 the costophrenic angles on the frontal view could represent merely pleural
 thickening.
 No evidence of cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, or acute focal pneumonia.
