                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute-on-chronic renal failure, now fever, altered mental status and
 wheezing.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  This appears
 slightly worse compared with ___, with progressive obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is upper zone redistribution, similar to the prior film,
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  Doubt interstitial edema.  On the
 right, there is atelectasis at lung base, but no focal infiltrate or gross
 effusion.  A dual-lumen catheter is present, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse
 than on ___.  The differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate. 
 Small left effusion cannot be excluded.
