 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with epigastric pain and flushing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs and pleural spaces are clear without evidence of
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  Mild retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Heart size is within normal limits.  Osseous structures are
 intact.
