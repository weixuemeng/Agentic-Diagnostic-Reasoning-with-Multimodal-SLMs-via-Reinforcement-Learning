                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M HTN s/p cardiac arrest  // line placement RIJ CVC
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph at 01:24, a right internal
 jugular catheter has been placed, with tip terminating in the mid superior
 vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Note is made of apparent coiling of
 the proximal aspect of a nasogastric tube in the upper cervical region, which
 may be internal or external to the patient.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 improving bilateral alveolar perihilar edema and apparent decrease in size of
 a layering right pleural effusion.
