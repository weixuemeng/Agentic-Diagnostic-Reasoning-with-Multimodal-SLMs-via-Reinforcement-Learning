                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:24
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bleed status post endotracheal tube,
 check position.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 8:27.
 
 Two portable supine images of the chest dated ___ at 5:24 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  On the initial image, the endotracheal tube only lies 1 cm above the
 carina, but on the second image, the endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above
 the carina in satisfactory position.  The left internal jugular central line
 and right internal jugular large-bore catheter are unchanged in position. 
 Overall, the interstitial edema has resolved and there is improving aeration
 at the left lung base, although possibly a layering left effusion is present. 
 No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 diminished given supine technique.  The heart remains stably enlarged.
