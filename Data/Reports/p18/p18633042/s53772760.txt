                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, rule out worsening infection.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 8:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A large-bore right internal jugular catheter remains in place with its tip
 projecting over the right atrium, but unchanged.  Left internal jugular
 central line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  Interval extubation and removal
 of the nasogastric tube.  Improving aeration at the left base with an
 associated pleural effusion consistent with resolving partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascularity appears somewhat more ill-defined and
 therefore likely reflects superimposed component of mild interstitial edema.
 No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in rotation.
