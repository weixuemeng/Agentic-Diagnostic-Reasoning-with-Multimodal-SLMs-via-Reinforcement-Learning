                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening neuro exam, evaluate for fluid overload, SAH.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off, film.  An ETT is
 present, tip approximately 3.4 cm above the carina.    A right-sided large
 bore central line is present, tip over upper right atrium.  
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The possibility of a small left
 effusion cannot be excluded.  There is mild upper zone redistribution, but no
 overt CHF.  On the right, no CHF or gross effusion.  Possible minimal blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle.  On the current film, there is suggestion of
 left-sided volume loss that has increased compared with the prior film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Tubes and lines, including ETT, in satisfactory position.
 2) Left lower lobe collpase and consolidation again seen. Suspect some
 interval left-sided volume loss.Possible small L>R effusions.
 3) Mild UZRD, but no overt CHF.
