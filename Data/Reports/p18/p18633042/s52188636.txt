                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis status post CVA and cranial
 decompression. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube is 2.5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube is seen with
 its tip in a decompressed stomach.  A previously seen left internal jugular
 line is in the proximal SVC and unchanged.  Also seen is a large-bore right
 internal jugular catheter that overlies the right atrium and is unchanged.  
 
 There is generalized vascular engorgement consistent with mild biventricular
 decompensation.  There is a persistent left lower lobe opacity, which is
 similar in appearance to the prior study. The hilar contours are normal. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate, persistent left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 2. Pulmonary vascular engorgement due to worsening CHF.
