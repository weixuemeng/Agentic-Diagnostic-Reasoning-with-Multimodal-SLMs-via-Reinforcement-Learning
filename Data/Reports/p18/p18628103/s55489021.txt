 A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach.  The patient is markedly rotated limiting
 evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The aorta does appear
 prominent and unfolded.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Suture material overlying the
 left humeral head.
