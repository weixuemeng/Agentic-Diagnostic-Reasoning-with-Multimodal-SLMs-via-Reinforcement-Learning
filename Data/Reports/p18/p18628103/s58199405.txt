 obtain repeat in 1hr (___)  // Any pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
 been interval repositioning of the enteric tube, which now terminates in the
 proximal stomach.  Further advancement could be considered.
 
 There has otherwise been no interval change in the lungs.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely represent atelectasis, although aspiration could be considered in the
 appropriate setting.  No other consolidation, sizeable effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Widened cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of the enteric tube which terminates in the proximal
 stomach.
