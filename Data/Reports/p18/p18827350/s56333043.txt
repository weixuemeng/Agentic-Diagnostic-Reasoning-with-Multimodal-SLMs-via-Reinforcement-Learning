                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right internal jugular central venous catheter
 placement.  Evaluate position and assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single semi-supine frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 There is a new right internal jugular central venous catheter ending in the
 mid SVC.  Evaluation of the right lung apex is suboptimal secondary to the
 patient's lordotic positioning, causing the medial aspect of the clavicle to
 project over the upper portion of the lung.  A small right apical pneumothorax
 cannot be excluded.  There is no left pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear.  The
 heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded given patient
 positioning.  Recommend acquiring an additional frontal projection with the
 patient in a fully upright position.
 
 2.  New right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC.
 
 3.  Clear lungs.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 5:27 a.m. via
 telephone on the day of the study, one minute after discovery.
