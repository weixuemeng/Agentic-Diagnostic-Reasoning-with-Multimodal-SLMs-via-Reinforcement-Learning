                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with b cell lymphoma, tachycardia, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC, unchanged.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is normal.  Right paratracheal stripe widening and asymmetric
 enlargement of the right hilus are compatible with underlying mediastinal and
 right hilar lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the previous CT.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal
 consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a
 trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Gaseous distension of the stomach is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Continued mediastinal and right hilar
 lymphadenopathy, as seen on the previous CT.  Trace right pleural effusion.
