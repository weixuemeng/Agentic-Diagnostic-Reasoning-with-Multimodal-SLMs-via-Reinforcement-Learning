                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Focal right-sided chest pain reproducible on lower
 anterior lower thorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is somewhat underpenetrated in the upper portion.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced rib
 fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiothoracic process seen.
