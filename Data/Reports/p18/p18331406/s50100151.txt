                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ventral hernia repair.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are bibasilar
 opacifications consistent with atelectasis and possible small effusion on the
 right, presumably related to recent surgical procedure.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Little change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette and no evidence of vascular
 congestion.
