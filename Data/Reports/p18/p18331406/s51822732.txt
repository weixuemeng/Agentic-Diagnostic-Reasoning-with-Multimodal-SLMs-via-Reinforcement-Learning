                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever postoperatively.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Linear opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis, similar compared to the previous exam.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms suggesting underlying COPD. There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
