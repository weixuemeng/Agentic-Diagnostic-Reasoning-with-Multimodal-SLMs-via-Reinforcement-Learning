                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, non-small cell lung cancer status post radiation treatment
 with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and
 attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible
 with emphysema.  ___ fiducial markers are noted within the left upper lobe
 laterally with adjacent opacity compatible with radiation fibrosis with
 pleural thickening.  Previously demonstrated adjacent parenchymal lesions
 concerning for tumor recurrence within the region of treatment in the left
 upper lobe are better delineated on the previous CT and PET-CT.  No new areas
 of focal consolidation are present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities, with remote left-sided rib
 fracture again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Posttreatment changes in the left upper lobe.  Adjacent lesions within the
 left upper lobe concerning for tumor recurrence are better assessed on prior
 PET-CT and chest CT.  No new areas of focal consolidation are identified to
 suggest pneumonia.
