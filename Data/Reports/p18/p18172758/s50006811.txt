                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new DHT  // ?dobhoff tube placement     
 ?dobhoff tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the final image, the Dobhoff tube extends at least to the lower portion of
 the stomach, word appears to coil on itself so that the tip points upward and
 to the outer border of the stomach at the level of the mid to lower body.
 Otherwise, there is mild prominence of pulmonary vessels that could reflect
 either some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure or merely the AP portable
 view rather than the upright PA of the previous study.
