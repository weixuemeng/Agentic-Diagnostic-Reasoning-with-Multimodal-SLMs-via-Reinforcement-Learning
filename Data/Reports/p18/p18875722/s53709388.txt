                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and dizziness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are streaky perihilar opacities most
 suggestive of minor atelectasis which could accompany air inflammation.  The
 chest is mildly hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable aside from mild irregularities along mid
 thoracic endplates, probably degenerative.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.  Streaky perihilar
 opacities, which suggest minor atelectasis, best depicted on the lateral view.
 Mild mid thoracic degenerative changes.
