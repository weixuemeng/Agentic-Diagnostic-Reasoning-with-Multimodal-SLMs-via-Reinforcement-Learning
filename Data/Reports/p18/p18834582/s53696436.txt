                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  History of asthma with cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  Nodular opacity
 in the base of the right hemithorax is likely superimposition of normal
 structures, but shallow oblique views are recommended to exclude a lung
 nodule.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
