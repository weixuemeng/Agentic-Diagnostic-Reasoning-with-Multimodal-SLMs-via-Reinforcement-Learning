                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF in a patient with subjective
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes
 resulting in exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 crowding. Allowing for this, the heart is likely top normal in size. There is
 no appreciable pulmonary edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Indistinctness of
 the right heart border raises concern for right middle lobe pneumonia. There
 is left lower lung atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Indistinct right heart border, concerning for right middle lobe pneumonia.
 2. Low lung volumes without appreciable pulmonary edema.  Left lower lung
 atelectasis.
