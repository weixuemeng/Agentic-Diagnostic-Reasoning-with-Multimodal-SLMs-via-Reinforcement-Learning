 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:38 AM
  Newly placed NG tube and tip traverses the diaphragm and projects over the
  expected region of the stomach.  In the side port is probably in the region of
  the GE junction.  I would recommend advancing this tube by about 5 cm to
  ensure that is in the lumen of the stomach.  Aeration of the lungs is probably
  slightly decreased from the prior exam.  An there is probably slight increase
  in atelectasis and edema.  Otherwise, no significant change.
