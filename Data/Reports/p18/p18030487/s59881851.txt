                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated lactate and creatinine.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and there
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Linear opacities within the retrocardiac region
 likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no acute osseous abnormality.  Mild
 levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated along with mild
 degenerative changes.  Remote sternal fracture is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
