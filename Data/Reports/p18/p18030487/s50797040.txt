 calcification are similar along the aorta.  A streaky left basilar opacity is
 consistent with unchanged minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the mid to
 lower thoracic spine.
