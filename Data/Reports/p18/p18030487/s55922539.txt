                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and cough.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a mildly enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is a focal nodular opacity in the right
 lung base.  There are also patchy right basilar opacities as well as linear
 opacities in the retrocardiac region of the left lung base.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is tortuosity of
 the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nodular opacity in the right lung base in addition to patchy opacity. 
 Differential includes scarring, atelectasis, or pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting, although a focal nodular component in particular may
 represent a true nodule.  Correlation with prior imaging of the chest is
 recommended.  If not available CT of the chest is recommended when clinically
 appropriate.
