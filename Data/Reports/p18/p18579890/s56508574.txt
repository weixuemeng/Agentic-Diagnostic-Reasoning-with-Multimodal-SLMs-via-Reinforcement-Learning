                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fractured tibia, has "chronic R apical pneumo
 per nursing home recrord  // pre-op cxr, ptx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient's overlying chin partially obscures the lung apices. Given this, right
 apical opacity may relate to apical pleural thickening although a subtle
 underlying consolidation is not excluded. AP lordotic view would be helpful
 for further evaluation. No definite consolidation seen on the lateral view.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. While
 the osseous structures of the spine are not well assessed, there appears to be
 possible subtle compression deformities, not well assessed. Degenerative
 changes are partially imaged at the shoulder joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient's chin partially obscures the lung apices. Right apical opacity may
 relate to apical pleural thickening although underlying consolidation is not
 excluded. AP lordotic view would be helpful for further evaluation and is
 recommended.
