                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, mitral stenosis, mitral valve
 endocarditis on amp/gent, new hypoxia on exertion  // acute cardiopulmonary
 process     acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has improved slightly overall
 since ___.  The generalized reticulation of the lungs is a reflection of
 emphysema also responsible for marked hyperinflation.  The asymmetry in
 distribution of the abnormality, worst at the lung bases and right upper lobe
 could be due to pulmonary edema in the setting of mitral regurgitation. 
 Pneumonia is not excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  No
 pneumothorax.  Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
 
 The patient has had mitral valve replacement and probable coronary bypass
 surgery.
