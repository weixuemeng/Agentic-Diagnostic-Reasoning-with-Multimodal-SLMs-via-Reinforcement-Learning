                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Question pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  
 
 As on prior, there are increased interstitial markings seen at the lung apices
 bilaterally.  Given chronicity of these findings, they are most suggestive of
 chronic lung disease.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is identified.  There is no
 confluent consolidation or effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable compared to prior.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable upper lobe parenchymal changes.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
