                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Interval removal of a right pigtail thoracostomy tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a right pigtail thoracostomy tube. A right
 IJ catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are unchanged in position.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged. A persistent left
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, though underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
 Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity reflecting atelectasis or
 consolidation.
