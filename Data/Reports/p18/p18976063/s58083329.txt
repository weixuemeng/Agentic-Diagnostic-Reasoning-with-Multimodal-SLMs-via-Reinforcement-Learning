                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F status post liver transplant with nausea, vomiting,
 malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There has been interval improvement in multifocal
 opacities within the right lower lobe and left upper lobe, likely reflecting
 areas of resolving pneumonia.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Residual patchy opacities within the right lower lobe and left upper lobe
 compatible with improving pneumonia. Minimal left basilar atelectasis.
