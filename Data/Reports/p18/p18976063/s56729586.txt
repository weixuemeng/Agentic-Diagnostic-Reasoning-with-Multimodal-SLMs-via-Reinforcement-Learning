                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia initially, now hypercarbia  //
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the right
 internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position.  The lung volumes
 have decreased, causing an apparent increase in extent and severity of the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the lung bases on both the left and the
 right site.  Only the very lung apices are cardiac widely ventilated.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette can no longer be delineated.  No pneumothorax.
