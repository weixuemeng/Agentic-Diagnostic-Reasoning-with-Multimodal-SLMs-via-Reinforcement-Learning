 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:57 PM
  There is been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which terminates
  approximately 6.9 cm above the level of the carina.  A right internal jugular
  Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects in the approximate location of the right
  pulmonary artery.  A left cardiac pacing device is present, its leads which
  appear intact and in unchanged position.  Median sternotomy wires appear
  intact.  LVAD noted, unchanged in position.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Central
  vascular engorgement and moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Probable left
  pleural effusion is present.  The right costophrenic angle is incompletely
  imaged.  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD  // eval for ETT position s/p intubation
 eval for ETT position s/p intubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema probably unchanged.  Severe cardiomegaly chronic.  Small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 New endotracheal tube tip at the thoracic inlet should not be withdrawn any
 further.  New right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the region of the
 pulmonary outflow tract, not the pulmonary artery.  Subsequent chest
 radiograph, 21:46, available at the time of this review shows repositioning of
 the Swan-Ganz catheter in the right pulmonary artery.
