                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately
 8.5 cm above the carina, similar to the prior film.  Right IJ Swan-Ganz
 catheter is present, tip overlying proximal right pulmonary artery.  Multiple
 cardiac support devices are similar in configuration.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but similar to prior.  There is
 vascular plethora and hazy opacity consistent with CHF.  Probable small right
 effusion.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.  Left costophrenic angle is
 obscured by the LV assist device --___ small left effusion cannot be excluded. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall appearance is similar to the prior study.
 
 CHF, with small right and question small left effusion.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Multiple lines, tubes, and cardiac support devices, with note made that the ET
 tube lies at the level of the clavicular heads.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
