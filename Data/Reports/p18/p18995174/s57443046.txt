                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, dyspnea, question intrathoracic process versus worsening fluid
 overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Single-lead pacemaker is present, with tip over right ventricle.  There is
 cardiomegaly, unchanged.  
 
 There is asymmetric increase in interstitial markings, unchanged.  Probable
 enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, which could reflect an element of
 pulmonary hypertension. Probable slight interval engorgement in the right
 hilum. Minimal tenting of the left hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation or
 effusion is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable assymetric increase in right-sided interstial markings, but
 no interval change to suggest worsening fluid overload.
