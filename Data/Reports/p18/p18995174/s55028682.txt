                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p LVAD // eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the radiograph of 1 day prior, there is no significant
 interval change in all support devices, including a Swan-Ganz catheter, ET
 tube, and NG tube. Sternotomy wires remain intact and aligned.  The LVAD is
 partially imaged. Left pectoral pacemaker remains in place.  Mild pulmonary
 edema with small to moderate layering pleural effusions has not changed.
 Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is also unchanged. Persistent
 retrocardiac opacification is likely due to bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
