                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lvad,  WBC  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is almost 8.3 cm from the carina.  LVAD appears similar to prior. 
 Right jugular venous line, temperature probe with tip in the stomach, left
 chest cardiac device and 2 lead tips, ___ mediastinal drains, right chest tube,
 left jugular approach PA catheter, and surgical clips appear similar compared
 to prior.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Mild asymmetric edema is worst in the left lower lobe.
 Edema in the right lung is mildly worse compared to prior. Atelectasis in the
 left mid lung is moderate.  Retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left
 hemidiaphragm is similar to prior.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, as on
 prior. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.  Oral contrast is again seen loops of bowel, as on
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Edema in the right lung and atelectasis in the left mid lung are mildly
 worse compared to prior.  Other findings are similar to prior.
 2. ET tube remains several cm superior to optimal position.
 3. Significant retrocardiac opacity is similar to multiple priors, likely
 atelectasis.
