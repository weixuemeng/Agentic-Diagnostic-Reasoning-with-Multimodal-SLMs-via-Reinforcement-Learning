                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with systolic CHF p/w SOB  // pulm edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, single lead ICD remains in place
 terminating in the right ventricle. Cardiac silhouette remains markedly
 enlarged is accompanied by massive enlargement of the main and central
 pulmonary arteries. Asymmetrical diffuse interstitial pattern in the right
 lung is likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, particularly considering
 minimal interstitial abnormalities at the left base. Small right pleural
 effusion is also evident.
