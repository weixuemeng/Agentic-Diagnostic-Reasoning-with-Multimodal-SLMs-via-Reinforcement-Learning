                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with an LVAD.  Evaluate for evidence of effusion
 or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires, LVAD device, and left chest wall pacemaker are again
 seen in unchanged position.  There is stable, severe cardiomegaly.  New,
 bilateral, ill-defined, perihilar infiltrates are consistent with
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Focal opacity at
 the left base could reflect alveolar edema, although underlying pneumonia
 cannot be definitively excluded.  New, mild blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is consistent with a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable, severe cardiomegaly with new, mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and a
 small right pleural effusion.
