 TECHNIQUE:  Serial AP portable chest radiographs dated ___ at 07:37,
 ___ at 07:___ at 13:07.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an ET tube terminating approximately 4.7 cm above the Carina. 
 Pacemaker with pacer wires, LVAD device, enteric tube remain unchanged
 compared to the prior radiograph.  Right-sided PICC terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and marked cardiomegaly with
 hilar vascular prominence is again noted.  New linear opacities in the right
 upper and paracardiac region likely represent atelectasis.
 
 No interval change in bony thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Unchanged pulmonary edema, marked cardiomegaly, hilar vascular prominence
 and bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, left more than
 right.
 3.  Lines and tubes as above.
