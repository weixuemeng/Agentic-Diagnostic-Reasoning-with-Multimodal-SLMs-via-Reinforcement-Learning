                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lvad  // check ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had recent CABG with intact and aligned sternotomy wires.  The
 left pectoral AICD and left ventricular assist device are unchanged in
 position.  A tracheostomy tube terminates in the mid trachea.  A nasogastric
 tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates
 in the main pulmonary trunk.  Increased bilateral airspace opacities are most
 likely due to worsening pulmonary edema.  A persistent retrocardiac airspace
 opacity is probably due to atelectasis.  The main pulmonary artery is
 prominent as in the past.  Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is
 unchanged.  The small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube terminates in the mid trachea.
 Increased moderate pulmonary edema.
 Stable prominence of the main pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 Stable marked cardiomegaly with left basilar atelectasis.
 Stable small left pleural effusion.
