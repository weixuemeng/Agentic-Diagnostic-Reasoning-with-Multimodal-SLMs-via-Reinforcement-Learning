                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, radiating to the back.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.  Allowing
 for differences in technique and positioning, mild cardiomegaly is probably
 stable.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum may also relate to the
 technique.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Apparent increase in cardiac size and widening of the mediastinum likely
 relates to the portable technique and patient positioning.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
