                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F NGT placement  // NGT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line has been repositioned -- the tip now overlies the
 distal most SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 An NG tube is present, it extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  The sideport
 overlies the upper stomach, distal to the GE junction.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora.  Doubt overt
 CHF.
 
 Again seen is patchy opacity in the right perihilar and infrahilar regions
 and,  to a lesser extent, in the left infrahilar regions.  Suspect slight
 interval improvement in left perihilar opacity.
 
 Opacification of the left costophrenic angle is again noted.  It is possible
 this is artifactual, related to overlying soft tissues.  No gross effusion.
 .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral patchy ___- and infrahilar opacities again seen, with possible
 minimal improvement on the left.
 
 Mild vascular plethora, unchanged.
 
 PICC line tip overlying distal SVC.
 
 NG tube tip and side-port both below the diaphragm.
