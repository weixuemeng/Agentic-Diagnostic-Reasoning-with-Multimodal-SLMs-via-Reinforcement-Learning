                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea on exertion, dry cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 No pulmonary edema is present.  A moderate size left pleural effusion is
 present along with a small right pleural effusion, both of which have
 increased in size compared to the previous study.  Patchy opacity in the left
 lung base likely reflects compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right and moderate-sized left pleural effusions, increased in the
 interval.  Compressive left basilar atelectasis.
