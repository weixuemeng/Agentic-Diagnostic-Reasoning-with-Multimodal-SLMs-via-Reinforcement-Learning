                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M w/fevers, s/p liver transplant, immunosuppresed, evaluate for
 occult pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Streaky linear opacity in the right lung base corresponding to the right
 middle lobe on the lateral view may represent atelectasis or an early
 consolidation depending upon the clinical setting.  Bronchial wall thickening
 suggests small airways disease versus bronchitis.  There is no lobar
 consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Streaky right middle lobe linear opacities may represent atelectasis or
 early pneumonia depending on the clinical setting.
 2. Mild bronchial wall thickening suggesting small airways disease versus
 bronchitis.
