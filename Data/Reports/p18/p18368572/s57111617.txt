                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the pelvis were reviewed.  There is stable
 mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity
 within the lower lobe on the lateral view, may be due to atelectasis or
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusion and lower lobe opacity on the
 lateral view could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
