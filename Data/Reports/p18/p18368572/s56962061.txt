 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with nausea and vomiting.  NG tube repositioned. 
 Evaluate lines and tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 1:55 p.m.:
 
 Upper enteric drainage tube has been withdrawn to the mid portion of
 non-distended stomach.  Bilateral pleural effusion, moderate on the right,
 small on the left, improved since earlier in the day, obscure much of the
 detail in the lungs, but aside from the left lung base, lungs could be clear
 of focal abnormality.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is presumed.  No
 pneumothorax.  Heart size mildly enlarged.
