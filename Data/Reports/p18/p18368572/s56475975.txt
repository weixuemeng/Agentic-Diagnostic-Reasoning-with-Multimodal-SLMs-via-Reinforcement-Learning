  There is increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial
  markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are again
  noted, left greater than right, and likely representative of atelectasis;
  however, an overlying infectious process must be excluded in the proper
  clinical setting.
