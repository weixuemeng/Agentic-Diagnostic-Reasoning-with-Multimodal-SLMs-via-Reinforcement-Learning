                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of congestive heart failure presenting
 with anasarca
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and torso CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged, increased when compared to the previous
 radiograph, but similar in size compared to the previous CT, and likely
 reflects a combination of cardiomegaly and a small to moderate pericardial
 effusion given the globular configuration.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted with retrocardiac opacity, possibly reflective of atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely reflective of a
 combination of cardiomegaly and small to moderate pericardial effusion.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with retrocardiac opacity, likely
 atelectasis.
 3. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
