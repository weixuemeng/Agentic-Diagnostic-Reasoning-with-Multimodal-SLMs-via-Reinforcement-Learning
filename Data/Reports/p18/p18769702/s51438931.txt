                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The study
 was initially dictated on ___ after the conclusion of the study; however,
 the dictation/transcription is lost and I am re-dictating it today, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which could
 relate to atelectasis, although an underlying consolidation is not excluded. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 likely accentuated due to low lung volumes, however, appears borderline to
 mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could
 relate to atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
