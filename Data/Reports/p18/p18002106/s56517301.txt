                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall, right-sided chest pain, evaluate for pneumothorax or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from today.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  There is
 no mediastinal widening.  The lungs are clear.  No pleural effusions.  A rod
 overlies the right lateral ribs and the rib fractures seen on concurrent CT
 torso of T5 through T9 are not visible.  There is a small amount of
 subcutaneous air in the right lateral soft tissues, likely from small right
 pneumothorax seen on CT torso.  The small pneumothorax is not seen on this
 radiograph however probably due to overlying rod.  No focal parenchymal
 opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A rod overlies the T5 through T9 rib fractures and small
 pneumothorax that were seen on CT torso from today.  Small area of
 subcutaneous air in the right lateral soft tissues.  No mediastinal widening. 
 No focal lung parenchymal opacities.
