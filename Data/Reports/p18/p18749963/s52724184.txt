                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:56.  Targeted review of
 chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with the prior study, inspiratory volumes are lower.  Allowing for
 this, again seen is a small right effusion, with collapse and/or consolidation
 at the left base.  The degree of right base atelectasis is more pronounced. 
 Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, also more pronounced. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No left-sided effusion.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly similar.  Opacity overlying the
 right lung apex medially appears to relate to a mask or other device outside
 the the patient -- clinical correlation is requested to confirm this.
 
 No pneumothorax identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower inspiratory volumes, with interval increase in  atelectasis at both
 bases.  Continuing right pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot
 be entirely excluded.  However, the mid and upper zones of both lungs remain
 clear of focal opacities.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, probably similar to prior.
 
 Question mask accounting for faint opacity at the right lung apex medially.
