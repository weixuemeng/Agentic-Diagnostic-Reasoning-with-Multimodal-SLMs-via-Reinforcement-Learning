                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is present.  The aorta is mildly
 tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications at the knob.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with upper lobe
 predominant emphysematous changes noted.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is of unknown chronicity with right basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.  Patchy left basilar opacity may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  A trace right pleural
 effusion is likely present.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild emphysema.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity. 
 Trace right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis, though infection
 is not excluded.  Patchy left basilar atelectasis.
