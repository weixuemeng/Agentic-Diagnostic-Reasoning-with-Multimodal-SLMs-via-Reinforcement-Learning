                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary hypertension and dyspnea.
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes continue be low with bibasilar atelectasis. A retrocardiac
 opacity seen on the lateral radiograph likely represents atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be fully excluded. There are no pleural effusions or
 pulmonary edema. The heart is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity likely
 represents atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
