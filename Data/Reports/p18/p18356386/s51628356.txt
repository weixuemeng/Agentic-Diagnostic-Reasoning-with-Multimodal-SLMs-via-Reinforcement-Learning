                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cellulitis/osteomyelitis with PICC
 line placed ___.  Confirm PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and
 concealed partially cardiac contours.  Significant cardiac enlargement is
 unlikely.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  A left-sided PICC line
 can be identified.  The line is of rather poor contrast, but can still
 identify the line to reach the right-sided mediastinal structures, some 2 cm
 above the level of the carina.  This is consistent with termination in upper
 third of the SVC.  The lateral view confirms the position of the PICC line
 pointing caudal confirming the position in the SVC.  Lateral view discloses
 the posterior pleural sinuses to be free from any pleural effusion.  No acute
 pulmonary infiltrates are seen.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Old PICC line placed at other institution terminating in upper
 third of the SVC.
