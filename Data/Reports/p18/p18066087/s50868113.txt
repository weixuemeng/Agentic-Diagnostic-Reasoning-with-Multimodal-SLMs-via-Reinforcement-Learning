                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p Bentall with ___mm ___ ___ mechanical valve conduit/___ mm
 graft for aortic dissection ___ now with hypoxia. To look for any acute
 pulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter is in the upper SVC. Swan-Ganz
 catheter has been removed.  Mediastinal and pleural drains remain in stable
 position.  Lung volumes remain quite low.  Left hilar and left retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Postoperative widening of the mediastinum is improving.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with left basilar atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
 2. Improving postoperative mediastinal widening.
