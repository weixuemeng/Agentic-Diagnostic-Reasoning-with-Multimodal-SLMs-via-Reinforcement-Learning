                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:48
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with TRALI, now intubated, assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study of ___ at 17:48.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 8:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central line, left PICC line, endotracheal tube, and
 feeding tube are unchanged in position, though the distal portion of the
 feeding tube is not entirely visualized.  There are layering bilateral
 effusions.  Persistent patchy confluent perihilar and basilar airspace
 opacities could be consistent with TRALI or cardiogenic edema, infection or
 hemorrhage and therefore clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
