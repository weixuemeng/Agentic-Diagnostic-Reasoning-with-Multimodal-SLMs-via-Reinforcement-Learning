                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough for several weeks, shortness
 of breath and new anemia.  Crackles at the left base.  Rule out abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has had right mastectomy and axillary node dissection.  Mediastinal
 widening is attributable to fat deposition seen on a torso CT of ___ which also showed mild bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement.  A slight
 interval increase in hilar caliber is not sufficient to raise concern about
 clinically significant adenopathy, suggesting instead pulmonary arterial
 enlargement.
 
 Heart is normal sized.  A small-to-moderate hiatus hernia is larger today than
 it was in ___.  There is new mild atelectasis in the lingula, but no
 pulmonary edema or good evidence for pneumonia.  Right apical pleural
 parenchymal irregularity is scarring.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.  No pneumothorax.
