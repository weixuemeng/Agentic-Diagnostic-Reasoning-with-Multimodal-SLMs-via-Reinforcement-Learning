                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates at the
 thoracic inlet.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There are patchy right perihilar and less distinct and vague
 left lower lung opacities.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right perihilar and left infrahilar opacities, worrisome for
 aspiration in the setting of suspected seizure, although not entirely
 specific.
