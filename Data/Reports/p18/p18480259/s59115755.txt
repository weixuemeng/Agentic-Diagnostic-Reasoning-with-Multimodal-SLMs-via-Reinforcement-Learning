                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest wall pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  Blunting of the
 posterior left costophrenic sulcus suggests a very small pleural effusion.  A
 trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.  A catheter
 projects over the epigastrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace suspected pleural effusion, at least on the left; otherwise
 unremarkable.
