                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, motorcycle accident with multiple right rib
 fractures and small right pneumothorax, evaluate expansion of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained in the supine position. 
 Known rib fractures are better seen in the recent CT.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Left lung is clear except
 for mild atelectatic changes in the base.  Diffuse haziness in the right lung
 likely represents layering of the hemothorax seen on prior CT scan.  The
 pneumothorax seen at CT on ___ can not be appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION: No significant changes compared to the prior study, with findings
 consistent with known right sided hemothorax, but no radiographically evident
 pneumothorax.
