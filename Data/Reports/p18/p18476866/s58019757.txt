                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fall and pain in the left flank and chest
 wall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. There are
 no focal opacities concerning for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Although no rib fractures are
 identified, the study is suboptimal for the detection of rib fractures and if
 there is high clinical concern dedicated rib views should be obtained.
