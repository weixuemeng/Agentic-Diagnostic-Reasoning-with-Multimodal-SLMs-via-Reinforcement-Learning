 HISTORY:  Ventricular ectopy.  Pain in left shoulder for five or six weeks.

 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads
 follow their expected courses, unchanged, continuous from the left axillary
 pacemaker.  Heart is mildly enlarged, exaggerated by severe pectus deformity. 
 Lungs are clear, and there is no pleural abnormality, specifically no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  I see no displaced rib fracture.  Areas of focal
 tenderness should be marked for rib detailed views.
