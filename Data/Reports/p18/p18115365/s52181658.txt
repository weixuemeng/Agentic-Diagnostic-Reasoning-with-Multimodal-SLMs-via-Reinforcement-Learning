 INDICATION:  Cough and pleuritic chest pain, immunosuppressive therapy,
 evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate scoliosis of the thoracic spine with subsequent asymmetry
 of the rib cage.  Osteophyte formation at the level of the lower thoracic
 spine.
 
 As compared to the previous exam, an area of increased density at the right
 lung bases has completely resolved.  The current image shows no evidence of
 focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia or other infectious changes. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pleural
 effusions.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
