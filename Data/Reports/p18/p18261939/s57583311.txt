                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with newly found.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current
 exam with secondary to crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  The lungs
 are clear of confluent consolidation or large effusion.  Calcific density
 again projects over left mid lung.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but given
 differences in technique and inspiratory effort has not changed.  Increased
 fullness with an unusual contour again seen at the left hilum.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process given low inspiratory lung volumes. 
 Unusual contour of the left hilum for which dedicated PA and lateral could
 help further characterize when patient is amenable.
