                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough and chest congestion.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is an
 unusual rounded appearance of the left hilum that could be due to an enlarged
 vessel, less likely lymphadenopathy.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is a dense ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe, of
 unclear etiology and chronicity.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
 
 Shallow oblique views are recommended to evaluate the left hilar anatomy and
 opacity in the left lower lobe.
