                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, metastatic breast cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip
 terminates in the right atrium. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal
 contours are grossly unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 opacities within the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Previously
 noted osseous metastases are seen better visualized on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar atelectasis.
