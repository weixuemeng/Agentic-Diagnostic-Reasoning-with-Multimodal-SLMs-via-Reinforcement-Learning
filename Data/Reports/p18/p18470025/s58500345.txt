                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of respiratory distress,
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Underlying soft tissues cause some underpenetration.  Given this, there
 appears to be moderate pulmonary vascular congestion/edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is most likely due to overlying soft tissue, although very
 trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No right pleural effusion is seen.
 There is no pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Volume overload and cardiomegaly.
