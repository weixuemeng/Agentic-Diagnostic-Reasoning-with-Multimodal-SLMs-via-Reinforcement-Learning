 congestion is stable.  Bibasilar atelectases, larger on the left and are
 unchanged from the prior study, but markedly increased from early the day
 before.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube
 tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the
 mid-to-lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening lung findings. Widened mediastinum. Evaluation with CT
 is recommended.
