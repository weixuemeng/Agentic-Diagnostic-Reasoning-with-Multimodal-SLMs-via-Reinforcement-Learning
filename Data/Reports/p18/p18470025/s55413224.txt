                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with sleep apnea and
 hypoxemia-hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained 15 minutes earlier.  The patient remains intubated, the
 ETT in unchanged position.  The same holds for a right-sided PICC line seen to
 terminate in the mid SVC.  A previously existing right internal jugular
 approach central venous line has been removed.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 Comparison of the lung fields suggests increased congestive pattern of the
 pulmonary vasculature, but quantitative assessment is difficult considering
 possible physiologic variations.  Review is extended to a more remote chest
 examination dated ___ a.m., i.e. seven hours prior to the present
 examination.  At that time, a coalescent parenchymal density was observed in
 the left upper lobe area.  This suspicious density has not progressed.  Thus,
 no evidence of any increased pneumonic infiltrate in this area.
