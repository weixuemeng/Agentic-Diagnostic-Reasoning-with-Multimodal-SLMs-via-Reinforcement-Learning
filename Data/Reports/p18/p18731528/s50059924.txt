                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible history of miliary tuberculosis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 are widespread micronodular opacities within both lungs, most evident in the
 left mid to upper lung and periphery of the right upper lung.  Subsegmental
 bibasilar atelectasis and minimal left mid lung linear atelectasis is noted. 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal, without
 evidence of lymphadenopathy.  Mild pleural thickening is seen along the
 lateral right chest wall.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Oral contrast material is noted within several loops of bowel,
 secondary to recent contrast administration for abdominal CT.  An IVC filter
 is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread micronodular opacities within both lungs, most
 probably within the left mid to upper lung and periphery of the right upper
 lung, concerning for miliary tuberculosis.  A vague rim-circumscribed opacity
 in the anterior upper thorax on the lateral view potentially suggests a
 cavitary lesion, although without definite correlate on the frontal view, so
 it could be regarded as equivocal .  The differential diagnosis would also
 include histoplasmosis or metastases, in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ at 10:45 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.  Final report
 discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:40 pm on ___
 regarding equivocal cavitary lesion.
