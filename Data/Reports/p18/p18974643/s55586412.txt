                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left internal jugular central venous catheter. Assess placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13 39.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Left jugular
 central venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC as before.  Increased
 prominence of bronchovascular structures is likely related to decreased lung
 volumes.  Persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm is noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The heart is mildly and stably enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes.  Satisfactory position of the left IJ line.
