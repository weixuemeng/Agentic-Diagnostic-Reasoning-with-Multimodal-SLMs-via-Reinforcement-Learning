                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, on HD, recent LIJ HD line pulled two nights
 ago, now left-sided neck and chest pain.  Question infection, pneumothorax,
 widened mediastinum.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The left IJ line is no longer visualized.  An IV overlies the right neck.
 No pneumothorax  or pneumomediastinum is detected.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged compared with
 ___.  There is upper zone redistribution and right cardiophrenic and
 retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged allowing for differences in technique. 
 Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is probably unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1)  Cardiomegaly.  The configuration is stable, but raises the question of a
 pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation requested.
 
 2) Upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora, consistent with
 mild CHF, grossly unchanged compared with ___.
 
 3) Patchy right cardiophrenic opacity,  minimal increased retrocardiac
 opacity, and minimal cpa blunting are again seen, unchanged.  
 
 4) No pneumothorax or other superimposed pulmonary process identified.
