                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and rhonchi in the right lung and persistently increased oxygen
 requirement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including tortuous
 aorta and potentially enlarged aortic arch.  There is interval substantial
 improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 present, unchanged, moderate bilaterally.  Right upper/mid lung nodular
 opacity is 9 mm in diameter, not seen on the prior study but potentially
 obscured by pulmonary edema.  Comparison with prior studies is required and if
 not available chest CT might be considered.
