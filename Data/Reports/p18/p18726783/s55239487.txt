                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia and myocardial infarction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  No pulmonary edema is
 identified.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are
 re- demonstrated.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.  Multiple clips
 are again seen within the left hemiabdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, likely similar in
 extent compared to the prior study allowing for differences in positioning. 
 Associated bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence for widened mediastinum.
