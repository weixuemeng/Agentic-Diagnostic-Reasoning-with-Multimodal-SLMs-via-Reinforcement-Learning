 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Widening of right
 mediastinal contour, may be due to lymphadenopathy or tortuous vascular
 structures.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and pulmonary
 vascularity is within normal limits, except for attenuation of upper lobe
 vessels, the latter suggesting the possibility of emphysema.  There are no
 focal areas of consolidation or substantial pleural effusion.
