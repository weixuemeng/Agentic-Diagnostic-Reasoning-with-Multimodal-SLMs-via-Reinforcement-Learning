                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe pneumonia and collapse, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for differences in
 technique, there may be mild improved expansion of the left hemithorax.  There
 is still some shift of the mediastinum to the left.  Right lung remains
 essentially clear.
 
 There are air-fluid levels seen in the upper right abdomen laterally that
 appear anteriorly on the lateral view.  This could merely reflect loops of
 colon interposed between the liver and hemidiaphragm.  Long air-fluid level in
 the stomach could reflect some gastric dilatation.
