 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is

 posterior left costophrenic sulcus.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Minimal patchy left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia. Possible
 trace left pleural effusion.
