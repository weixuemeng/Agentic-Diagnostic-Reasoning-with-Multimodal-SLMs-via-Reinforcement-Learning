                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Concern for TIA.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged. Aside from streaky basilar opacities suggesting
 minor atelectasis, the lungs are probably clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 There are several incompletely characterized thoracic compression fractures
 along the lower thoracic spine, several of which can be compared to prior
 radiographs from ___ and appear unchanged although for the most part these
 there are difficult to compare directly to the prior studies.  In addition,
 there is mild to moderate mid thoracic compression deformity with a sclerotic
 appearance to the vertebral body, new since ___ and also difficult to compare
 to the more recent radiographs, which did not include a lateral view.  The
 bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmnoary disease.  Several compression
 fractures of the thoracic spine, difficult to compare to earlier radiographs,
 but at least one and possibly more, are new although otherwise
 age-indeterminate.
