 edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.
 Again there is a large right pleural effusion with underlying compressive
 atelectasis as well as moderate bilateral pulmonary edema and enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some
 volume loss in left lower lobe and possible small effusion.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, pericardial effusion would have to be
 considered.
