                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD status post CABG who presented with pulmonary edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
 slightly improved from prior exam.  There is increased consolidation at the
 right lung base which is likely atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  An
 associated increased small right pleural effusion is seen.  No left pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged from prior exam. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacity at the right lung base with associated increased small
 right pleural effusion, likely representing atelectasis, less likely
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  Slight interval improvement of pulmonary vasculature congestion.
 
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
