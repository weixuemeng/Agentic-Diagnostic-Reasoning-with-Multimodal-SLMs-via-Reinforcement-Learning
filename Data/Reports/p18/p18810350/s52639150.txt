                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is
 again mild-to-moderately enlarged, but appears decreased in size.  Streaky
 opacity at the left lung base suggests minor atelectasis.  A right-sided
 pleural effusion has resolved.  A convex opacity appears to refer to the
 posterior right costophrenic sulcus and suggests a small residual subpulmonic
 effusion, possibly loculated and likely with associated atelectasis.  There is
 no evidence for pulmonary edema.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mostly resolved pleural effusion on the right, although with
 residual opacity probably localizing to the posterior right lower lobe, where
 there may be a residual pleural effusion.
