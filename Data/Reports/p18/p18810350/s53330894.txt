 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There are increased perihilar opacities which raise
 concern for mild pulmonary edema.  Right lower lobe opacity is seen which
 could be due to infection or aspiration.  There is also blunting of bilateral
 posterior costophrenic angles suggesting small pleural effusions.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
