                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post traumatic liver laceration, now with
 respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Slight improvement in small right
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Interval collapse of the left lower
 lobe. No significant pleural effusion or pulmonary edema is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Tracheostomy tube ends 1.5 cm from the carina.  Left-sided subclavian central
 venous line ends in the cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube is seen ending
 in the stomach.  A second enteric tube is seen also ending in the stomach. 
 Large bore right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid
 SVC.  A right-sided midline ends in the axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval collapse of the left lower lobe.
 
 2. A relatively long appearing tracheostomy tube ends less than 2 cm from the
 carina. Suggest clincal evaluation if this is optimal.
