 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 6:08 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post multiple operations for liver
 laceration, question assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 5:36.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position having its tip approximately
 1.5 to 2 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central line, right
 subclavian central line and feeding tube are likely unchanged in position,
 although the tip of the feeding tube is not identified on the current study. 
 The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  Overall, lung volumes remain low. 
 There is persistent patchy opacity at the right base most likely representing
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Probable layering right
 effusion.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given
 differences in patient positioning and rotation.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
