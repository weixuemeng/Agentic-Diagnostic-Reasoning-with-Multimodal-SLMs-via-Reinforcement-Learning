 FRONTAL SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  A tracheostomy is in standard position.  Right
 internal jugular catheter and right subclavian catheters end in the SVC,
 unchanged. Two nasoenteric tube course to the stomach with the tips out of
 view.  Two catheters project over the right hemithorax, unchanged.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no change from ___

 fissure. Edema on the left has improved. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  No substantial pneumothorax.
