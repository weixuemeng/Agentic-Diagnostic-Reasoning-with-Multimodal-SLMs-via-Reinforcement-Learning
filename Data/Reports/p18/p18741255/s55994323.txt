                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube is low,
 measuring 1.5 cm from the carina and pointing towards the right mainstem
 bronchus.  Proximal repositioning by at least 2 cm is recommended.  All other
 support devices including a left approach central venous catheter and
 nasoenteric tube are in expected unchanged position.  There is progressive
 consolidation within the right lung base and probable new moderate effusion,
 findings worrisome for worsening pneumonia.  Increasing opacity within the
 left mid and lower lung is also concerning for multifocal infection. 
 Atelectasis of the left lower lobe remains.  Upper lungs appear clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned endotracheal tube pointing towards the right mainstem
 bronchus.  Repositioning recommended.
 2.  Increasing basilar opacities with morphology concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia and increasing bilateral effusions.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results to Dr. ___ at
 10:06 a.m. on ___ by telephone, two minutes after discovery.
