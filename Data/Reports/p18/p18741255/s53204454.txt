                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 317 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hemothorax on right, status post chest
 tube removal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 317 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are
 unchanged in position.  A tube overlying the right upper quadrant is again
 seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a
 persistent consolidation in the right lower lobe with an associated elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm which may reflect lower lobe collapse.  In
 addition, there is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation with a layering
 effusion, favoring partial lower lobe atelectasis.  Bibasilar pneumonia should
 also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen,
 although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given
 semi-supine technique. Overall, there has likely not been any significant
 interval change since ___ at ___.
