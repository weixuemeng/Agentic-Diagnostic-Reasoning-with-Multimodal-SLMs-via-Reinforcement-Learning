                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old ventilator-dependent female with clinical concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is 2 cm from the
 carina.  A nasoenteric catheter tip is not fully imaged, though is at least
 below the diaphragm.  Left approach central venous catheter terminates in the
 mid SVC, unchanged.  Complete lobar collapse of the left lower lobe has
 decreased.  However, opacity within the left base persists and is likely a
 combination of partial left lower lobe collapse and a moderate effusion.  A
 new opacity in the medial right lung base may be due to interval atelectasis
 or aspiration.  The upper lungs are clear.  There is no overt edema.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Partial expansion of a previously collapsed left lower lobe, though with
 persistent partial atelectasis and a moderate left effusion.
 2.  New small right basal opacity, possible interval atelectasis or
 aspiration.
