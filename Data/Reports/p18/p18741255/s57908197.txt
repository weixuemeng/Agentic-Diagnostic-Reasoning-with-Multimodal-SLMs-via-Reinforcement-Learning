                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status-post trauma with multiple resulting
 surgeries.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen is a mild-to-moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion and stable-appearing bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is still present.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right-sided
 internal jugular central venous line ends at the distal SVC.  The right-sided
 supraclavicular subclavian line ends in the cavoatrial junction.  The
 tracheostomy tube is in adequate position.  Two enteric tubes course into the
 stomach and out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable-appearing moderate-sized right pleural effusion and
 bibasilar atelectasis with mild-moderate pulmonary edema.
