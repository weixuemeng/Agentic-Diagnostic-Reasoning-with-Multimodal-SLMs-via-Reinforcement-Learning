                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, ___:12 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube placed.  Please evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two AP frontal views of the torso show, at 12:13 p.m., a feeding
 tube with a wire stylet in place looped at the gastroesophageal junction,
 terminating back in the cervical esophagus.  Second image, obtained at 12:21
 p.m., shows that that feeding tube has been removed.  The third image, at
 12:24 p.m., shows the feeding tube looped in the esophagus just below the
 level of the carina returning to the cervical esophagus and out of view,
 presumably in the hypopharynx.  In all other respects, the images are
 identical.  The heart is moderately enlarged, previous pulmonary edema on
 ___ has improved, and there is still a very large right pleural
 effusion.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement, and the left subclavian
 line ends low in the SVC.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:35 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
