 remains in place.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is interval appearance of
 an elliptical opacity abutting the right hemidiaphragm which may represent
 loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure or an area of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.   Surgical packing material is
 seen overlying the right upper abdomen.  Low lung volumes. The previously
 described right lateral rib fractures are not as well seen on the current
