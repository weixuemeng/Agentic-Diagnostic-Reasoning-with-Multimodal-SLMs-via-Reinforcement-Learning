 Comparison is made with prior study ___. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 standard position.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased.  Small right
 effusion is probably unchanged allowing difference in positioning of the
 patient.  Mild vascular congestion is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
