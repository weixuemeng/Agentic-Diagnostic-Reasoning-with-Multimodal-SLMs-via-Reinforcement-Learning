                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:25 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 5:58.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 12:25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian central line
 remain in place.  There has been interval removal of the right basilar chest
 tube.  No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is slightly diminished given semi-erect positioning.  There is
 persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with patchy basilar opacity
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation
 with associated layering effusion most likely representing compressive
 atelectasis, but again pneumonia should also be clinically considered.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
