 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 not identified.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  A left
 chest tube remains in place.  A left subclavian central line continues to
 terminate in the proximal SVC.  There is persistent triangular opacity at the
 right base likely reflecting atelectasis or pulmonary contusion.  There is
 increasing consolidation in the retrocardiac region, also likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is a
 layering left effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart remains stably
 enlarged.  Aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous.  No pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
