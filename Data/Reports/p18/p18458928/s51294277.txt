                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position, after intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 3 hr prior on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrate the endotracheal tube with the
 tip in the mid thoracic trachea.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal,
 though slightly prominent secondary to lower lung volumes.  There is no focal
 consolidation, obvious pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Multiple rib
 fractures are better evaluated on CT torso from the same day.  Contrast is
 seen within the bilateral renal collecting systems.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. Multiple rib fractures are better evaluated on CT from the same day.
