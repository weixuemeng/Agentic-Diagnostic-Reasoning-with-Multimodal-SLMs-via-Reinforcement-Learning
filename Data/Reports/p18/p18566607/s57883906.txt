                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure, morbid obesity and cellulitis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval increase in cardiac silhouette.  In
 part, it might be related to the portabletechnique of the study or increasing
 in the pericardial fat pad, but underlying true increase in the heart cannot
 be excluded thus correlation with echocardiography is recommended.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.  There is mild vascular
 engorgement that might be consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Note is made that this study neither confirm nor excludes diagnosis of
 pulmonary embolism or aortic acute pathology. If clinically warranted,
 correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
