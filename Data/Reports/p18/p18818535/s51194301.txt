 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular approach central
 venous catheter, which terminates in the right atrium, and could be retracted
 approximately 3 to 3.5 cm for positioning just above the cavoatrial junction.
 Otherwise, the lung volumes are slightly low, but clear, with no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or focal airspace opacity. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ central venous line terminates in the right atrium, and could be
 retracted 3-3.5 cm for positioning just above the cavoatrial junction.
