 down.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The right
 hemidiaphragm appears elevated, similar to prior exam.  An enteric tube
 terminates below the diaphragm, but the side hole at the GE junction.  A
 compression deformity of the T11 vertebral body is better seen on prior CT
 thoracic spine.  Osseous structures are otherwise grossly unremarkable.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Enteric tube terminating within the stomach, but with the side hole at the
 GE junction.
