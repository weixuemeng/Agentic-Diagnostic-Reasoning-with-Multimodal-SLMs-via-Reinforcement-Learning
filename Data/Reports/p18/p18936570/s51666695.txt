 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath, likely from
 pneumonia, edema, assess for evolution.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain markedly diminished with patchy opacities at both
 bases likely reflecting lower lobe atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  There is crowding of the vasculature with no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the low lung volumes.  No
 large effusions.  Interval decrease in gastric distention.
