 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is massive over distension of
 the stomach. The over distended stomach causes elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with reduction of lung volumes.  Subsequent areas of
 retrocardiac atelectasis are visualized.  In addition, there is an increase in
 diameter of the vascular structures, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema.
 Finally, new opacities are visualized at the bases of the right lung. These
 could be caused by a atelectasis or reflect aspiration or pneumonia.  Short
 term radiographic followup should be performed.
