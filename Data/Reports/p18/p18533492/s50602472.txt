                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___ and CT
 abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is present secondary to a distended
 gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Distended gastric
 fundus causing mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm raises question of
 slow gastric output.
