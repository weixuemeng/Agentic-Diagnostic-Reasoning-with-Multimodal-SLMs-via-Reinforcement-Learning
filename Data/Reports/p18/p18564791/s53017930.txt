                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis versus hematemesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  There appears to be external artifact
 overlying the lateral left lower lung base.  There is patchy right basilar
 opacity.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen which may be
 due to hyperinflated lung, however trace pleural effusion is not excluded. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is mild to
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflated lungs.  Patchy right basilar opacity could be due to infection
 or aspiration.  Recommend followup to resolution.  
 
 Cardiomegaly.
