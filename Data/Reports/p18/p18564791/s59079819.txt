                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:30 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification at the base of the right hemithorax is at least a small pleural
 effusion but there could be consolidation there as well.  Conventional frontal
 and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful in making the distinction. 
 Mild atelectasis at the base of the left lung medially is the only abnormality
 on that side.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  No appreciable left pleural
 effusion.
