 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Small calcified nodules at the left apex suggest
 small granulomas.  Apical pleural scarring is also partly calcified, but
 otherwise there is no evidence for pleural calcification.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
