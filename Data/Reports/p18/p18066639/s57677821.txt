                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. There are low lung volumes which cause crowding of
 bronchovascular structures. No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is identified. Mild atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. There
 are no acutely displaced fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tube tips in standard positions.
 2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
