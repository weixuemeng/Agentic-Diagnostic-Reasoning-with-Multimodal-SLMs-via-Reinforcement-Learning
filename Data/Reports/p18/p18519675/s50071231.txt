                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have all been removed.  Following chest tube removal, there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists, accentuated by the relatively low lung volumes.  Little change in
 the appearance of the lungs with retrocardiac opacification consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobe and small bilateral effusions with mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
