                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion has decreased.  There is continued and possibly increasing
 opacification at the left base consistent with pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Less prominent changes are seen on the right.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
