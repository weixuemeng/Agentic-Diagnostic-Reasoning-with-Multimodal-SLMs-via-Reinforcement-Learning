                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, vomited
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is likely due to the presence of low lung volumes.  Increased
 patchy opacities are noted within the lung bases, more so on the right.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are moderate degenerative
 changes noted throughout the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  Cholecystectomy
 clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased patchy bibasilar opacities, more apparent on the right. This may
 reflect worsening atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes, but
 aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
