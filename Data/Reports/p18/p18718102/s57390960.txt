                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation in the setting of endocarditis 
 // Pls evaluate tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The extreme upper edge of the right and left chest is excluded from the film.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina, at the level
 of the mid clavicular heads. A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying
 cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, not significantly changed.
 
 Innumerable small, irregular opacities are seen throughout both lungs, with a
 somewhat peripheral distribution.  In addition, there appear to be slightly
 coarsened interstitial markings diffusely in both lungs.  These are similar,
 but, on the left, slightly more pronounced. No obvious cavitation is
 appreciated.
 
 No left pleural effusion. The right lower chest is excluded from the film, but
 no gross right effusion is seen.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip at level of the clavicular heads approximately 4.1 cm above the
 carina.
 2. Innumerable small patchy opacities seen throughout both lungs, similar to
 yesterday's radiograph, but probably increased on the left.  Given the
 clinical setting, these are concerning for multifocal airspace disease,
 possibly septic emboli.
