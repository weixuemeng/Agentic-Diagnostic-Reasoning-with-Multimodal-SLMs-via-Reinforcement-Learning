                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis. intubated  // eval for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 22:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube tip lies slightly above the level of the clavicular heads
 approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. The right subclavian central line tip
 overlies the cavoatrial junction. An NG tube is present. Due to
 underpenetration is difficult to trace through the lower mediastinum into the
 abdomen.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen are diffuse patchy
 opacities in both lungs. The distribution and density appears similar to the
 prior study. The foci themselves appear slightly less distinct, but I suspect
 this is predominantly due to technique and slight motion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip appears slightly higher than on yesterday's exam. NG tube not
 well visualized in the lower mediastinum, due to technical factors.
 2. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Diffuse bilateral
 parenchymal abnormalities are similar to the prior exam. Please see comment
 above.
