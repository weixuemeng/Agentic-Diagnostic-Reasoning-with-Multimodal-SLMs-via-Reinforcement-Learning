 Generalized increase in radiodensity throughout the lungs is probably due to
 worsening pulmonary edema, since moderate cardiomegaly has increased, but
 could be hemorrhage associated with multiple areas of cavitating infection and
 septic emboli.  Pulmonary hemorrhage could be playing a role Small pleural

 ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a
 nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
