                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Amorphous
 calcification projecting over the lateral mid chest may be due to calcified
 pleural plaques.  There is also calcification along the left cardiac border,
 which could be due to pericardial calcification or possibly related to
 additional pleural plaques.  The right lung is clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of left-sided pleural plaques raising concern for prior
 asbestos exposure.  Linear calcification projecting over the superior left
 heart border could be due to pericardial calcification versus additional site
 of pleural plaque.
