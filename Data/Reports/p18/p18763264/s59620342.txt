                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest 
 
 FINDINGS: The right heart border on the frontal view is obscured, in part by
 anterior costal calcification. Elsewhere, numerous calcified granulomas are
 stable.  Clips are noted in the right axilla and right hilum. Cardiac size is
 normal.  The right hilus is enlarged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Extensive bilateral degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint and chronic
 post traumatic changes of the right humeral head are slightly worse. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Suggest oblique views to assess possible right middle lobe
 pneumonia.
