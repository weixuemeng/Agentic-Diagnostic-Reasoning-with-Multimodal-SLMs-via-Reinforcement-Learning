 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 There is patchy change along the lingula, producing focal left heart
 silhouetting.  Followup radiograph after antibiotic treatment is suggested. 
 The remainder of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lungs appear grossly
 clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 Focal silhouetting of the left heart border is suggestive of lingular
 consolidation.  Followup radiograph suggested.
