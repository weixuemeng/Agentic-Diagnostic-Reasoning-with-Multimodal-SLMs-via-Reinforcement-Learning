                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with bilateral rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  However, left hilum is mildly prominent and may include a
 calcified lymph node. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. The left hilum is midly enlarged, likely due to lymph nodes. Correlation
 with prior imaging is recommended to see if this is a new finding that
 warrants further characterization or not. Otherwise, a repeat radiograph in 3
 months is recommended.
