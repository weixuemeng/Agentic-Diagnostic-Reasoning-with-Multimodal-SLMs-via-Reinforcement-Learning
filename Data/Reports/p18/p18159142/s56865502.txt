                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes are present. Mild
 cardiomegaly with a left ventricular predominance is unchanged compared to the
 prior exam.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Prominence of the
 right superior mediastinal contour is unchanged, and again may relate to
 tortuous vessels.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
