                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation of patient with pleural effusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increase opacification of the right base consistent with an increase in
 moderate pleural effusions now measuring moderate to large in size with
 adjacent atelectasis.  An overlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Again
 noted is a large rounded opacity in the right mid lung consistent with
 patient's known mass.  Otherwise, the left hemithorax appears clear.  
 
 The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged in comparison to the prior study and
 raises suspicion for a pericardial effusion.  
 
 There is no overt edema.  Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in right pleural effusion, now moderate to large in
 size, with adjacent atelectasis. It is worth noting that hemorrhage cannot be
 excluded. 
 
 2.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette raising suspicion for a pericardial
 effusion.  A dedicated Echo is recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 3.  Known large right midlung mass is again noted. 
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 10:42 am on ___.
