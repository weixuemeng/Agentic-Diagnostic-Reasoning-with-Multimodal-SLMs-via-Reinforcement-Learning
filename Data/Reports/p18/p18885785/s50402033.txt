                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, recent pigtail, bronchoscopy, question free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The extreme
 lateral right lower hemithorax is not included on the image and AP pelvis
 catheter is not seen on the images.  Given this, there has been interval
 increase in now moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. 
 Right base opacity may be due to combination of the above.  However, an
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Again, a large rounded opacity seen
 in the lung consistent with patient's known mass.  The left lung is clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. 
 Right base opacity could represent combination of the above.  However,
 underlying consolidation may also be present.  Large right pulmonary mass
 again seen.
