                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a very large pleural effusion occupying much of the right
 hemithorax with mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures and inferred
 atelectasis of much of the right lung.  A portion of the right upper lobe
 remains aerated, however.  Patchy left basilar opacity suggests minor
 atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion on the left.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right-sided pleural effusion.  Evaluation with chest CT,
 preferably with intravenous contrast, may be helpful to assess further.
