                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance.
 
 Right pleural effusion has accumulated in the interim, despite the presence of
 the pleural catheter, small.  The known right upper lobe mass is
 redemonstrated, with a craniocaudal dimension of 6.8 cm, grossly unchanged
 since the prior study.  There is also evidence of lobulations of the pleural
 effusion along the right chest wall.  There is no pneumothorax.  No new
 consolidations have been demonstrated.
