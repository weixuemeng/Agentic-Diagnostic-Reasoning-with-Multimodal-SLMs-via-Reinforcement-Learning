 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:12 PM
  Right basilar pleural pigtail catheter in place with interval increased hazy
  opacification of the right lower lung zone which may represent reaccumulation
  of pleural fluid or dependent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Large rounded right
  lung opacity compatible with the patient's known malignancy.  Left lung
  relatively clear although trace pleural fluid is not excluded.  Stable
  enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with newly diagnosed lung cancer and pneumonia versus
 aspiration.  Has pneumonia improved?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___ chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right lung mass measuring 6.6 cm is unchanged.  Right moderate pleural
 effusion is reaccumulating; the right chest tube still projects at the lung
 base.  Mild left basilar opacification is unchanged since ___ and
 could only reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac mild enlargement is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion is reaccumulating.
 2.  Unchanged mild left basal opacification likely due to atelectasis,
 unchanged since ___.
