                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post pigtail thoracentesis catheter.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right lower chest tube has been placed which ends as a
 pigtail within the lower right hemithorax.  There is a persistent
 moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion, but substantially reduced. 
 Associated parenchymal opacity suggests persistent partial atelectasis of the
 right lung.  Leftward shift of mediastinal structures has resolved.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post pigtail catheter placement.  No evidence for
 pneumothorax.  Substantial decrease in right-sided pleural effusion.
