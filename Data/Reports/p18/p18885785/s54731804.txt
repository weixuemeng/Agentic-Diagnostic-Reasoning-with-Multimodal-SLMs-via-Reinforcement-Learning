                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy and right upper lobe biopsy.  Please
 assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed same day and CT
 chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates rounded
 opacification projecting in right mid lung consistent with known mass. 
 Interval decrease in right lower lung opacification is likely due to decreased
 effusion with residula right lower lung opacification concerning for
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Stable mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette corresponding with a moderate pleural
 effusion previously identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Slightly improved aeration of the right lower
 lung. Finding likely represents residual pneumonia after interval decrease in
 right pleural effusion.
