                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for consolidation in an ___-year-old woman with
 bronchiectasis, presenting with productive cough and mid lobar crackles left
 greater than right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate relatively well-aerated
 lungs than a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is mildly increased
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle, somewhat obscuring the right heart
 border.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly increased opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle.  Although
 atelectasis can have this appearance, in the right clinical setting this
 finding could reflect early pneumonia.
