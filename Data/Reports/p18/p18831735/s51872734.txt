                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and pneumonia  // Interval change     
 Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. 
 Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 pulmonary edema and layering pleural effusion on the right with compressive
 atelectasis at the base.  This appearance is all superimposed on chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
