                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ ___ only speaking man who
 presented with left sided weakness and neglect, found to have a large right
 parieto-temporal hemorrhage with mass effect and small midline shift.  //
 Please assess for NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray from 11:07 AM
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 There is cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 Air overlying the right inferior cardiac silhouette relates to a very large
 pulmonary bulla seen on the ___ CT scan.
 
 Lobulated calcified densities at the lung apices are again noted, unchanged.  
 An additional nodular density is seen in the right upper zone, partially
 obscured by the EKG lead on today's study.
 
 Otherwise, doubt focal consolidation, overt CHF, or gross effusion.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle cannot be excluded.
 
 Old, healed right-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 2 NG type catheters appear to be present.  1 has a radiopaque tip that
 overlies the lower esophagus and adjoining gastric fundus.  The other overlies
 the distal esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. 2 NG type catheters appear to be present.  1 has a radiopaque tip that
 overlies the lower esophagus and adjoining gastric fundus -- this does not lie
 a completely within the stomach.  The second catheter overlies the distal
 esophagus and does not extend into the stomach.
 2. Nodular density in the right upper zone, separate from the biapical
 densities.  The differential diagnosis includes a non calcified granuloma of
 versus a pulmonary nodule or metastasis.  Please see more complete description
 and recommendations provided in the chest CT report from ___.
