                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with desat  // ? Aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Slight displacement of the cardiac
 silhouette by large right base bulla is again noted.  Again seen are
 lobulated, partially calcified masses in both lung apices suggesting prior
 granulomatous disease and/or silicosis/ pneumoconiosis.
 
 There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, without significant
 change.  No focal infiltrate or effusion is otherwise identified on this AP
 view.  Old healed right-sided rib fractures again noted.  A small nodular
 opacity in the right mid zone laterally overlying the right seventh rib
 posteriorly measures approximately 6.0 mm in corresponds to a noncalcified
 nodular density on the ___ CT scan (601b:24).
 
 Thin caliber appearance of the trachea within the chest raises question of
 saber sheath trachea/tracheomalacia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Doubt significant interval change.
 2. No new focal opacity to suggest aspiration is identified.
 3. A small non calcified nodular density in the right mid zone has a correlate
 on the chest CT obtained ___.  Please see separate report of chest
 CT.
 4. Thin caliber intra thoracic trachea raising question of tracheomalacia.
