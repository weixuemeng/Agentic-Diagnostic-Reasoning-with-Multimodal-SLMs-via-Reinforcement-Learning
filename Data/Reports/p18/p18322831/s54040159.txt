 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  This probably accounts for the change in size of the heart. 
 Continued mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The layering effusions

 be a manifestation of a more erect position of the patient.  Substantial
 volume loss is again seen in the left lower lobe.
