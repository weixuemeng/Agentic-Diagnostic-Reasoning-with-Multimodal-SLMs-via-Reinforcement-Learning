                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with diabetic ketoacidosis, positive serum
 troponin, hematemesis, evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval
 removal right-sided PICC line.  More conspicuous in comparison to prior
 radiograph is hazy airspace opacity occupying much of the lower right lobe. 
 This likely reflect a combination of layering pleural fluid, atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.  Left lower lung subtle airspace opacification
 may represent crowding of bronchovascular structures and basilar atelectasis
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no
 evidence of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity at the right lower lung likely reflects a combination of
 layering pleural fluid and atelectasis, infection cannot be excluded.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.
