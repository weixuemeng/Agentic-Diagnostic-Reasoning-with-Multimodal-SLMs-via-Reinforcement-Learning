 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath for one week.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a markedly tortuous
 aorta and widened mediastinum which may represent combination of tortuous
 aorta and mediastinal lipomatosis/other soft tissue.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is mildly prominent and lung volumes are low.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
