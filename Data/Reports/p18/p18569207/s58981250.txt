                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sickle cell and likely acute chest syndrome 
 // confirm ET tube placement and assess interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are no significant changes compared to the prior radiograph performed
 yesterday morning. On the right side, there is a mild to moderate pleural
 effusion as well as underlying area of consolidation.  Left lung base opacity
 may be due to atelectasis and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax.  Stable
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Splenic calcifications due to auto-infarction
 are less well visualized on this radiograph; this can be partially seen on CT
 chest from ___.  Osseous structures are dense diffusely, and there
 is a probable right humeral infarct, findings consistent with sickle cell
 disease.
 
 The IJ introducer terminates at the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  The enteric tube extends to the
 stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Unchanged mild to moderate right pleural effusion, with underlying
 consolidation at the right lung base. These findings are concerning for acute
 chest syndrome.
 2.  Right IJ introducer, ETT and enteric tube are appropriately positioned.
