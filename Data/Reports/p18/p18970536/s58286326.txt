                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post mitral valve repair and aortic arch replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate sternotomy wires and a
 mitral valve annuloplasty ring.  There has been interval removal of a right
 internal jugular central catheter.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 unchanged.  Again seen are bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis, the left effusion slightly increased versus
 redistributed due to differences in patient position.  No focal opacity
 concerning for infectious is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis, left
 effusion slightly increased versus redistributed due to differences in patient
 position. 
 
 2.  Interval removal of a right internal jugular central catheter.
