                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post recent cardiac surgery.  Evaluate for
 central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There are bilateral small pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  There is cephalization of the vessels
 consistent with mild vascular congestion, without frank pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours have the expected post-operative
 appearance.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right-sided internal jugular
 central venous line ends at the mid to distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid
 to distal SVC.
