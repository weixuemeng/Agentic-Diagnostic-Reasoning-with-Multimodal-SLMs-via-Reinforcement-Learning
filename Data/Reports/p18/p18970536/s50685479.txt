                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has been
 removed and there is no definite evidence of pneumothorax.  There is poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with interval loss of volume
 in the left lower lobe.  Otherwise, little change except for the Swan-Ganz
 catheter being removed and replaced with a right IJ sheath.
