                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with subsegmental defects and perfusion in the
 left lung unmatched on ventilation scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, primarily because of subsegmental atelectasis at the
 lung bases, left greater than right; a nonspecific finding but certainly
 consistent with acute pulmonary embolus.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement and
 very mild edema in the perihilar and lower lungs suggest cardiac
 decompensation.  Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.
