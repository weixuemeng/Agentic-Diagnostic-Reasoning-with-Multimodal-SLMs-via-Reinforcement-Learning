 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there is considerable increase in interstitial
 markings diffusely in both lungs, with more confluent opacity at the lung
 bases, including new increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  There is mild retraction of the right minor fissure. 
 Again seen is background hyperinflation suggesting copd and mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly with a calcified aorta.  Azygos lobe again noted, with increased
 opacity within the azygous lobe.There is also new blunting of both
 costophrenic angles.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial opacities in both lungs, with probable alveolar
 component at both lung bases and small bilateral effusions, essentially all
