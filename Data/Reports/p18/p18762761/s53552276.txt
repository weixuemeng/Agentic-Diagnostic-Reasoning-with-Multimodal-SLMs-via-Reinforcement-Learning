                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Ms. ___ is an ___F with history of HTN, HLD, CHF, COPD, and PAD
 presenting after a MVA c/b open R both-bone forearm fracture s/p ORIF on
 ___, with subsequent development of chest pain and elevated troponins c/w
 NSTEMI. Hospital course complicated by respiratory failure requiring
 intubation ___ acute exacerbation of CHF with pulmonary edema and left
 brachial pseudoaneurysm s/p repair by vascular on ___. Now s/p diuresis with
 successful extubation on ___ with increased O2 requirement  // pulm edema,
 eval for pneumoniapulm edema, eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 08:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous dense consolidation in all lobes improved between ___ and
 ___, indicating it was largely pulmonary edema, the very.one.  There is
 some residual edema in those areas and more dense opacification in both lower
 lobes probably a combination of atelectasis, residual edema, and overlying
 pleural effusion common at least moderate on the right.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists, but it too has improved over the past several days.  Hyperinflation
 due to emphysema explains its very irregular distribution earlier.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
