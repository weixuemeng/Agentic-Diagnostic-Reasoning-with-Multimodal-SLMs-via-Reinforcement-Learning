                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette.Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded.  Hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Bronchovascular crowding is demonstrated without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis
 though infection is not completely excluded.
