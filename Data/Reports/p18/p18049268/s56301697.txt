 jugular tunneled dialysis catheter with cough and fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 03:20 a.m.
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval improvement of pulmonary
 edema, currently with only minimal residual present.  Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, are unchanged.  Bibasal
 areas of atelectasis are noted with no new consolidations seen to develop in
 the interim to suggest interval development of infectious process.  The
 hemodialysis catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.
