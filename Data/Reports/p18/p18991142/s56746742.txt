 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with febrile neutropenia, gestational trophoblastic disease
 // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Right chest wall Port-A-Cath is
 noted with its tip in the lower SVC. Patient is known to have multiple
 pulmonary nodules which are better assessed on prior CT chest. Subtle
 nodularity is however noted in the right lung base. Mild volume loss in the
 left lung base is noted which likely reflect interval development of
 atelectasis. Difficult to exclude pneumonia. A small adjacent pleural effusion
 is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax. No edema. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary nodules better assessed on prior CT chest. Left basal opacity likely
 atelectasis though cannot exclude pneumonia. Possible adjacent small pleural
 effusion.  Port-A-Cath positioned appropriately.
