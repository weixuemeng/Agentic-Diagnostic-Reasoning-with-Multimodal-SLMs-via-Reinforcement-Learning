                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough shortness of breath and back pain similar to
 prior symptoms of PNA.  // Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.   There is no confluent consolidation or effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Degenerative changes seen at the
 shoulders.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs likely largely due to low
 lung volumes and secondary atelectasis.  Superimposed vascular congestion or
 atypical infection would be difficult to exclude.
