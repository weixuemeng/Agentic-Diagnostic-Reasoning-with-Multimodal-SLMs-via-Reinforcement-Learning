                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of CHF, here with
 dyspnea, chronic cough, and bright red blood per rectum.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to underpenetration and overlying soft tissue.  Given
 this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 focal consolidation seen.
