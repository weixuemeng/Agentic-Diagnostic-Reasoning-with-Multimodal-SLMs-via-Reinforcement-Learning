 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate interval increase
 in cardiac silhouette in patient with known severe cardiomegaly. Finding may
 represent worsening of the same versus pericardial effusion.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion.  Faint retrocardiac opacification likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Remainder of the lungs is clear.
