                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after Robotic-assisted left
 upper lobectomy with persistent air leak and discontinued chest tube.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval improvement of the left basal aeration.  Tenting of the
 diaphragm is associated with prior lobectomy.  Slight left mediastinal shift
 is unchanged.  Loculated apical pleural fluid is suspected given the opacity
 that has a convex contour towards the lung and most likely is connected to the
 fissure.  Right lung is essentially clear.  No right pleural effusion
 demonstrated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
