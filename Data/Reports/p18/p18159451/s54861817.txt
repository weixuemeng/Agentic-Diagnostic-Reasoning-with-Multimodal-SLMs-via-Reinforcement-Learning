                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post left upper lobectomy on ___
 for lung cancer with nondraining left chest tube, question increase of left
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is a left
 chest tube in unchanged position with the tip positioned near the left lung
 apex.  There is increased left basilar opacity which likely represents left
 pleural effusion.  There is no discernable pneumothorax on the left.  The
 right lung remains clear.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 grossly stable, though the left heart border is somewhat effaced.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of left chest tube with increasing left basal
 opacity likely representing effusion and probably a component of atelectasis. 
 No definite pneumothorax is seen.
