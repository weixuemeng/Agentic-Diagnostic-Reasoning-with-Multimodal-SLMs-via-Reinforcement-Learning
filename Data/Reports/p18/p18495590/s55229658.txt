 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hysterectomy on ___, now with
 pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits; specifically no prominent pulmonary arterial contour
 is evident.  The lungs are clear without evidence of consolidation or
 peripheral opacities.  The pattern of pulmonary vasculature appears
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib
 fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process - specifically, no radiographic
 evidence of PE is seen; if clinical concern for such persists, chest CTA or
 V/Q scan may be considered.
