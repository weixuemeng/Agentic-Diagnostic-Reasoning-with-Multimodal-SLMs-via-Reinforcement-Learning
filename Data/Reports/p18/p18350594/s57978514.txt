                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough with foreign
 body sensation.  Possible prior sarcoidosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, without evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy.  Again demonstrated are
 bi apical linear opacities suggestive of scarring with architectural
 distortion, unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Aeration of the lung bases appears improved
 compared to the prior chest radiograph.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite evidence for aspiration pneumonia.  Unchanged scarring and
 architectural distortion within the lung apices.
