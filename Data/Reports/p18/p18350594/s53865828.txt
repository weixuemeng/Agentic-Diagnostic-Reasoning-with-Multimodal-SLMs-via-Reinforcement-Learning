                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Coarsened appearance of lung markings is more prominent than on the prior
 radiographs, particularly in the right lung, but there is no focal
 consolidation, only patchy left basilar opacity obscuring the left
 costophrenic sulcus, suggestive of minor atelectasis.  It is also difficult to
 exclude a tiny pleural effusion on the left.  Mild rightward convex curvature
 is again centered along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial prominence, particularly in the right
 lung, since the prior study. Airway inflammation or atypical infection could
 be considered in the appropriate clinical setting, although the appearance is
 not specific.  No focal consolidation.
