                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 ___-year-old male patient with cholangiocarcinoma and shortness of breath,
 pneumonia versus effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting semi-upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding single AP chest view examination of ___. 
 Comparison of frontal views demonstrates grossly unchanged findings with
 relatively high-positioned diaphragms obscuring the heart size resulting in
 multiple plate atelectases on the bases.  Lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
 No evidence of new acute infiltrates and no pneumothorax seen in the apical
 area.  The lateral view demonstrates the patient in markedly reclined
 position.  The linear atelectatic densities can be identified again.  There is
 no evidence of significant fluid accumulation in the posterior dependent
 pleural sinuses.  Heart size cannot be assessed as borders are obscured
 related to patient's high-positioned diaphragms.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 demonstrating a congestive pattern.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral basal atelectasis, infectious overlie cannot be
 excluded.  There is, however, no evidence of pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax is seen.
