                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with known AAA repair and endoleak now with
 worsening chest pain and  SOB with movement  // eval for etiology of chest
 pain specifically any widening of mediastinum
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, widening of the left mediastinum at
 the level of the aortic arch has apparently slightly worsened with associated
 rightward deviation of the trachea.  Aortic stent grafts remain in place in
 this patient with history of aortic aneurysm and endoleak.  Chest CTA may be
 helpful for more complete evaluation.  Worsening left lower lobe opacity may
 potentially be postobstructive in the setting of a known central mass.  This
 finding as well as known left chest wall mass and other findings of malignancy
 have been more fully assessed by a recent CT and PET-CT exams.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Notification of increased widening of mediastinum was
 documented in the original wet read report.
