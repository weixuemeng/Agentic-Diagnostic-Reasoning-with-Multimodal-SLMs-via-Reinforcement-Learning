                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:48 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Ascending aorta replacement, re-implantation of arch vessels. 
 Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 6:45 p.m.:
 
 Post-operative widening of the mediastinum is stable in the region of the
 arch, but there may be an increased caliber to the mediastinum along the right
 heart border and ascending thoracic aorta, findings suggesting
 hemopericardium, reflected in leftward displacement of the right transjugular
 Swan-Ganz catheter.  A relatively small left apical pleural or extrapleural
 hematoma which increased earlier after surgery is stable.  There is no
 appreciable layering left pleural effusion.  Lung volumes are well maintained.
 Atelectasis moderately severe in the left lower lobe, mild elsewhere.  ET tube
 in standard placement.  A Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary
 artery.  Course of the esophagus denoted by the drainage tube is expected.  No
 definite pneumothorax.
