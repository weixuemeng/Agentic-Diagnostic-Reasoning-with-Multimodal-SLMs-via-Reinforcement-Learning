 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:52 PM
  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has significantly improved when compared
  to the ___ study.  A small left pleural effusion has also
  decreased.  A new curvilinear lucency paralleling the right mid to lower
  aspect of the mediastinum could be a tiny quantity of pneumomediastinum or
  pneumopericardium, which if present would be related to interval
  pericardiocentesis.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly smaller on today's
  study, likely due to interval pericardiocentesis.  No pneumothorax.  The
  endotracheal tube appears appropriately positioned.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with pericardial effusion,
 post-pericardial effusion drainage.  
 
 Compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left internal jugular dual-channel catheter has tip ending at the
 origin of the SVC, unchanged since prior chest x-ray.  ET tube is new with tip
 ending at 3 cm from the carina.  NG tube has tip ending in mid gastric cavity,
 unchanged since prior. Three new ___ chest tubes have been placed, one in
 each pleural space and one in the anterior mediastinum.  Patient has had
 stenting of the descending aorta, which appears still enlarged for hematoma,
 recently characterized in CT of ___.  Lung volume is moderate
 with improved ventilation due to improved pleural effusion and reduced
 atelectasis.  Minimal pleural effusion is at the left lung base.  Heart size
 is smaller probably for reduced pericardial effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
