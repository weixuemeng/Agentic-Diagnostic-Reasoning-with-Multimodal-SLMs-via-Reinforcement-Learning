                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Preop evaluation for an ascending aorta replacement, now with
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a severely widened
 mediastinum, correlating to the ascending and descending aortic aneurysm and
 Type B dissection.  The aortic knob is not well visualized, and there is
 rightward deviation of the trachea.  There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly.
 A left perihilar opacity corresponds to the mass seen on recent CT.  A left
 pleural cap and left base opacity represent pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severely widened mediastinum with rightward deviation of the trachea, a left
 perihilar mass, and pleural effusion are unchanged from recent CT.
