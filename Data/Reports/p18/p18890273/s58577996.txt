                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen
 in position of the nasogastric tube.  The tip is projecting over the middle
 parts of the stomach, with the tip slightly coiled in the stomach.  No
 evidence of complications, no pneumothorax.
 
 On repeat images, a nasogastric tube coiled in the esophagus is seen on
 earlier images and a correctly positioned nasogastric tube is seen on later
 images.  The old nasogastric tube is removed.  No evidence of complications.
