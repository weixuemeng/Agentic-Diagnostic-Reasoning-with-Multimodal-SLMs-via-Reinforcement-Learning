 The stent has been placed at the level from the aortic arch towards the
 abdominal aorta.  The enlarged mediastinal contour due to the enlarged aorta
 is demonstrated.  The left mid lung lesion, highly concerning for lung mass is
 demonstrated and should be further assessed as suggested on the prior CT of
 the chest.  There is left pleural effusion noted, small-to-moderate.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
