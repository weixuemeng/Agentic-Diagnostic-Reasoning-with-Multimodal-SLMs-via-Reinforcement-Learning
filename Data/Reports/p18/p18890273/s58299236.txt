                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Renal failure with volume overload on exam and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Aortic stent
 graft is again seen.  There is a left pleural effusion which appears increased
 since the prior study.  Small right pleural effusion may also be present. 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities suggest a degree of mild pulmonary edema.  Left
 perihilar opacities again seen which on prior studies raised concern for lung
 mass.  Patient is status post median sternotomy.  Surgical clips are also
 noted in the right upper outer hemithorax.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right pleural effusions.  Perihilar opacities
 suggest component of underlying edema.  Left mid lung mass better assessed on
 prior studies.
