                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p AAA who presents with cough, sputum and sob decrease
 breath sounds on the left  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with only a small
 amount of aerated parenchyma in the mid/upper left lung.  The right heart
 border is visible and there is no mediastinal shift.  The left heart border is
 obscured and heart size cannot be assessed.  The right lung is well expanded
 and clear. Overlapping aortic stents are unchanged in position and an
 indentation along the upper margin of the stent appears similar.  The
 sternotomy wires and surgical clips are noted.  Degenerative changes are again
 seen in the shoulders.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant,
 as before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax new compared to the
 prior examination.  Findings could represent the large pleural effusion with
 atelectasis although infection or underlying lesion are entirely possible.
