                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  The aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, focal consolidation or
 pleural effusion.  Scarring within the lung apices is re- demonstrated. 
 Relative attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings within the lung apices
 is compatible with underlying emphysema.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated as are clips
 within the right breast.  Soft tissue anchor within the right humeral head is
 noted.  There are degenerative changes within the thoracic spine with mild
 loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body, unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
