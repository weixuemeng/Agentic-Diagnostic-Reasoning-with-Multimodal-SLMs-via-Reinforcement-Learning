                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax is detected on these views.  Bilateral posterior costophrenic
 blunting is secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions.   Heart size is
 mildly enlarged, unchanged compared to prior. No pulmonary edema is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities, likely
 atelectasis, with small bilateral pleural effusions, similar compared to
 prior. No pulmonary edema.
