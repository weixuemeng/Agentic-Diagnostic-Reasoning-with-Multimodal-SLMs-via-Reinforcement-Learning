                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest tube remains in place, with a very small unchanged left
 apical pneumothorax.  Overall appearance of the chest is similar to the prior
 study performed several hours earlier except for slight improved atelectasis
 at the right base and slight worsening atelectasis at the left base.
