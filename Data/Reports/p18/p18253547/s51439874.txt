                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM DATED ___ AT 10:23s
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post MVC with repair of the left
 diaphragmatic rupture and multiple other traumas.  Question fluid overload.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 5:07.
 
 Single AP semi-erect chest film was obtained.  No lateral view was submitted
 for interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. 
 Left chest tube remains in place.  There is a stable small left apical
 pneumothorax which is unchanged since ___ at 5:07 a.m.  There is
 interval improvement in aeration within the lungs with a residual patchy
 opacity at the bases, left greater than right which likely represents a
 resolving fluid overload, although pneumonia or atelectasis particularly at
 the left base cannot be entirely excluded.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable, although the heart remains mildly enlarged despite AP technique. 
 Skin ___ are seen overlying the visualized upper abdomen in this
 post-surgical patient.  Probable small left pleural effusion.  The presence of
 a pneumothorax was conveyed directly to the patient's nurse, ___ as well as
 ___, the surgical resident caring for the patient, by phone on ___ at
 12:10 p.m.
