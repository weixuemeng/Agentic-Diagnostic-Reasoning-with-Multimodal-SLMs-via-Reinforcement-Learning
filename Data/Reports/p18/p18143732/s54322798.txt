                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Persistent fevers.   
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no evidence of pneumonia or
 pleural effusion.  There is probably a tiny calcified granuloma in the right
 lower lobe.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
