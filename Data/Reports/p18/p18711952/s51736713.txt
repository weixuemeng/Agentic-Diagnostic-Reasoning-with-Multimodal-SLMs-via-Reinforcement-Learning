 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.  Previous
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is smaller, although there is residual
 pleural thickening.  Lateral view shows a region of peripheral atelectasis,
 where previously there was a posteriorly collected pleural effusion.  There
 may be a tiny right pleural effusion in the posterior sulcus.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, larger today than in ___, but the pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable and there is no edema.  A supraclavicular dual-channel central
 venous catheter ends in the upper right atrium.
