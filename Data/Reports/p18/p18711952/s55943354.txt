 Comparison to ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent left-sided pleural effusion which may have slightly increased
 in size with some associated patchy opacity most likely reflecting patchy
 atelectasis, although pneumonia could also have this appearance.  There is
 increasing prominence to the interstitium suggesting a component of
 superimposed interstitial edema.  A smaller right effusion is likely.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
