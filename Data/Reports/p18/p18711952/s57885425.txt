                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion has partially reaccumulated
 following recent thoracentesis procedure.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits
 of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 peribronchial cuffing.  Additionally, a widespread reticular and nodular
 pattern has developed diffusely as well as more confluent opacities in the
 left mid and lower lung regions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Partial reaccumulation of left pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
 2.  Diffuse reticulonodular opacities, possibly due to pulmonary edema, but
 atypical or opportunistic infection is an additional consideration given the
 nodular appearance.  If persistent after diuresis, consider a CT scan for
 further characterization to exclude a miliary nodular infection.
 3.  Patchy and linear opacities in left mid and lower lung may be due to
 atelectasis or infectious consolidation.
