 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had previous spinal fixation and interval right shoulder
 replacement. Previous left shoulder replacement is again noted. Increased

 fluid overload. The small left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
 Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. There is no
 pneumothorax.

 pulmonary edema. The differential diagnosis includes transfusion related lung
 injury.
