                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, pulm edema and pleural effusion  //
 eval for interval change in pulm edema, pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has
 decreased in severity with residual asymmetrical edema worse on the right than
 the left.  Moderate right pleural effusion has apparently increased in size,
 although positional differences limit comparison.  Worsening bibasilar
 opacities are likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion although other
 secondary process such as infection is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
