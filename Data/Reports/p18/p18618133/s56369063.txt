                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with chronic dry cough and night sweats.  Evaluation for
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear except for a very small 2 mm nodule that is
 dense in the left upper lobe : it could be a calcified granuloma versus a
 small bone island of the posterior portion of fourth rib.  The right superior
 paramediastinal region is lightly widened; it could only be tortuous vessels
 or mediastinal lipomatosis but an underlying mass cannot be excluded.
 
 The cardiac contour is normal.  There is no pleural effusion and no
 pneumothorax.  The patient has a left humeral prosthesis and extensive dorsal
 spine surgery with two fusion rods.  The patient is known for ankylosing
 spondylitis.
 
 CONCLUSION:  The right superior paramediastinal region is slightly widened :
 it could only be secondary to tortuous vessels or lipomatosis.  If the patient
 has other previous exam, it will allow us to see if it is stable. If this is
 impossible, a CT scan is suggested.
