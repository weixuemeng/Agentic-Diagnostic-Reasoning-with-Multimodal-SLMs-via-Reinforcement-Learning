                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions which appear mildly increased compared to
 the prior study.  Bibasilar opacities may be due to combination of pleural
 effusions and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not entirely
 excluded, although it is felt less likely.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in bibasilar opacities.  No
 overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions which appear increased compared to
 ___.
