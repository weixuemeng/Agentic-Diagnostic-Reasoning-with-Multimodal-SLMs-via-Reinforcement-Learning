                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is very tortuous, but no definitive
 dilatation is demonstrated.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small. 
 Lungs demonstrate evidence of hyperinflation but essentially clear.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
