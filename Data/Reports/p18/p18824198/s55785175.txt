                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Biliary stenosis, cancer, persistent fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Heart size is
 within normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Blunting of
 the costophrenic angles bilaterally is compatible with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, relatively unchanged.  Streaky opacities at lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky opacities within the lung bases likely reflect bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Small bilateral effusions, relatively unchanged.
