 HISTORY:  Intermittent confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours otherwise are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Small right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged compared to
 the prior study.  Previously seen left pleural effusion appears improved if
 not resolved.  There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Partially imaged is a
 percutaneous catheter within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right pleural effusion, relatively unchanged compared to prior study
 with improvement and possible resolution of the previously noted small left
 pleural effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
