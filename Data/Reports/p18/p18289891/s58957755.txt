                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Mediastinum and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  No pulmonary vascular congestion
 is demonstrated.  Patchy opacities within both lung bases, left more so than
 right, could reflect atelectasis or infection.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
