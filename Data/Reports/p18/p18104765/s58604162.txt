                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with altered mental status, slurred speech evaluate for
 pneumonia or bleed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with tortuous aorta,
 hiatal hernia and mild cardiomegaly.  Linear opacity in the right lung base is
 similar to the remote prior study and likely represents atelectasis or
 scarring.  .  Blunting of the left posterior costophrenic sulcus likely
 represents a Bochdalek's hernia.  Multiple chronic appearing rib fractures are
 unchanged from the prior study.  Hyperinflation suggests COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Moderate hiatal hernia.
 3. COPD
