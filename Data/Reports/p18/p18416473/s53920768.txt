                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent falls.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged with a globular configuration
 similar to perhaps minimally increased.  There is a mildly asymmetric
 interstitial abnormality that is predominantly seen in the infrahilar region
 of the right lung with fine reticulation.  A new band-like opacity in the
 right costophrenic angle suggests mild coinciding atelectasis.  There is
 similar slight relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Surgical clips
 project along the right upper quadrant.  There is no evidence for pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality, with asymmetry, greater on the right than
 left, which may reflect an asymmetric form of vascular congestion, although a
 subtle manifestation of early infection cannot be excluded.  If symptoms were
 to persist, then followup radiographs could be considered.  
 
 2.  Moderate globular cardiac enlargement, similar to minimally increased,
 suggesting a pericardial effusion in addition to cardiomegaly.
