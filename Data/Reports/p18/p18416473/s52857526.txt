                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of recent fall, low
 platelets, weakness; when walks, leans to right, history of pancreatic cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiac
 silhouette enlargement persists with somewhat globular configuration, could be
 due to pericardial effusion in addition to cardiomegaly/cardiomyopathy.  As
 was also seen in the prior study, there is mildly asymmetric interstitial
 prominence, most noted in the right infrahilar region, could represent
 asymmetric vascular congestion, although infectious process is not excluded. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta remains tortuous.
