                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pancreatic cancer presenting with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent chest CT.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities in the mid and lower right
 lung correspond with areas of subsegmental atelectasis on the concurrent CT. 
 Stable mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural
 effusion. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Hilar fullness and cephalization of the pulmonary
 vessels suggests elevated central venous pressure, though no overt edema is
 identified.  The cardiac silhouette demonstrates a globular enlarged
 configuration, findings corresponding with a known pericardial effusion. 
 Dense calcifications within the aortic arch are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable right basilar subsegmental atelectasis and small right pleural
 effusion.
 2.  Enlarged globular heart, findings consistent with a pericardial effusion.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt edema.
