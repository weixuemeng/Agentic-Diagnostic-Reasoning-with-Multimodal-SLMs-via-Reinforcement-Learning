 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea on exertion.  Evidence of
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities
 identified.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but no local
 contour abnormalities or wall calcifications are present.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in apical area on the frontal view.  Mild degree of
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine but no evidence of advanced
 demineralization or vertebral body compression fractures.
 
 Increased extrathoracic soft tissue structures suggest adiposity.
