                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube to waterseal.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 14:17 p.m.
 
 A right-sided pig-tail-type  chest tube is present.  As before, there is
 moderate-sized pneumothorax at the right lung apex, which appears slightly
 smaller on today's exam.  A tiny ptx may also be present at the right
 cardiophrenic angle. Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region and
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle also noted.  Costophrenic
 angle blunting is new, though no large effusion is identified.  Mediastinum
 remains midline.  On the current exam, the cardiac silhouette appears small
 and hanging compared to the prior study, notably smaller than on the ___
 CXR.  No CHF, focal consolidation or left-sided effusion.  No left-sided
 pneumothorax.  Elsewhere and on the lateral view, cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Moderate right apical ptx, slightly smaller on tosays exam. Suspect tiny
 ptx at right costophrenic angle.
 
 2) Striking decrease is size of cardiac silhouette compared with ___.
 
 3) Otherwise, doubt acute pulmonary process.
