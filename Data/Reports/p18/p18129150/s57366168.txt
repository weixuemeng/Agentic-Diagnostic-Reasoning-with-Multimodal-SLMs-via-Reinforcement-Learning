                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube has been placed.  There is persistent
 moderate-to-large right-sided pneumothorax, but substantially decreased.  Of
 note, however, the contours of the right upper lobe are poorly defined with an
 area of substantial concavity.  This may indicate a substantial defect in the
 visceral pleura, bullous changes, atelectasis or some combination of these. 
 Persistent short-term radiographic followup is recommended.  The left lung
 remains clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no mediastinal shift.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Some decrease in large pneumothorax following right-sided chest
 tube placement.  Irregularity and concavity of the contour of the right upper
 lobe suggesting a possible source for air leakage and possibly an ongoing
 defect; short-term follow-up reassessment is recommended.
