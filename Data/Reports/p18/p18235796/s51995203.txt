                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath, tachycardia.  Evaluation for
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen, part of it is explained by atelectasis;
 however, superimposed process like pulmonary edema could also be included in
 the differential.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Bibasilar streaky opacities are seen.  Part of this explained by atelectasis. 
 To better assess these abnormalities a standard PA and lateral chest x-ray is
 suggested.  
 
 Dr. ___ have been contacted for the results.
