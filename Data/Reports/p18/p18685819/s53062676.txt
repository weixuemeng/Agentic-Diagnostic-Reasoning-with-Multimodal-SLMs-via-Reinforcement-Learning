                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with known pneumonia status post hydration,
 worsening hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:52 chest radiograph and chest CTA ___ at 17:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aortic knob calcifications are demonstrated. Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are lower compared to the
 previous radiograph. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, more so on
 the left, compatible with extensive centrilobular and tree-in-___ nodules seen
 on the previous CT along with a left lower lobe consolidative opacity. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, not changed
 from the previous radiograph accounting for differences in inspiration and
 compatible with infection.
