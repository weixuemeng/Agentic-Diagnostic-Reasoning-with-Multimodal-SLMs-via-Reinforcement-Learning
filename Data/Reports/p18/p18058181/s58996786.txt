                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube positioned, assess position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  An NG tube is
 seen with its tip descending below the left hemidiaphragm with its tip not
 included in the imaged field.  The endotracheal tube is also seen with its tip
 residing just less than a centimeter above the carina.  Retraction by at least
 1-2 cm is advised for more optimal placement.  Bibasilar opacities could
 represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low position of the endotracheal tube, for which at least 2 cm retraction
 is advised.  
 2.  NG tube positioned appropriately.  
 3.  Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  The
 possibility of aspiration not excluded.
