                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  New patchy
 and linear opacity has developed medially at the right lung base and may
 reflect focal area of atelectasis, but followup radiographs may be helpful to
 exclude a developing pneumonia in this region.  Lungs are otherwise clear.
