                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, rib fracture, or pneumothorax.
 
 Of incidental note are surgical clips in the right upper quadrant, presumably
 related to prior cholecystectomy.
