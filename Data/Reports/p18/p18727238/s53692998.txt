 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:03 PM
  Small right apical pneumothorax is stable or slightly smaller.  No mediastinal
  shift.  Right subclavian line terminates in mid SVC.  Elevated right
  hemidiaphragm and probable basilar atelectasis, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New right subclavian line with small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, the mediastinum now appears in anatomic position.  The
 previously seen pneumothorax is not identified on the current film. 
 
 There is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with some patchy opacity
 in the right cardiophrenic region, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. 
 The right and left lungs are otherwise grossly clear.   Right subclavian
 central line tip overlies the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The previously seen pneumothorax appears to have reexpanded.
 
 2.  Minimal collapse and/or consolidation in the right cardiophrenic region,
 with equivocal small right pleural effusion, both new on the current
 examination.
