                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ chronic mesenteric ischemia s/p aortomesenteric bypass  //
 assess for abnormalities
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  The
 presumed epidural catheter is no longer visualized.
 
 There is a new moderate-sized right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is increased retrocardiac density with patchy opacity at
 the left base, similar to the prior film, but slightly more pronounced.  There
 is blunting of left costophrenic angle which is new, consistent with a small
 left effusion.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged but may be unchanged allowing for
 considerable technical differences.  Aorta is calcified.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small to moderate size right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  This is a significant change compared with ___, as
 there was no right effusion or right base opacity on the prior film.
 
 Patchy left base opacity probable slightly increased, with new small left
 effusion.
 
 Upper zone redistribution.  Doubt overt CHF.
