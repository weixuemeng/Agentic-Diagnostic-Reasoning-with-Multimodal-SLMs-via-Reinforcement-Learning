                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with large left-sided stroke,
 persistent fever, on a ventilator, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  On the present examination, the patient is
 leaning markedly towards the left.  Patient is intubated, the ETT in unchanged
 position.  Left-sided subclavian approach central venous line again noted
 terminating overlying the mid portion of the SVC.  No pneumothorax can be
 identified.  Bilateral basal densities obliterate the diaphragmatic contours
 and are compatible with bilateral pleural effusions.  Marked cardiomegaly
 exists as before.  Pulmonary vasculature appears congested, perivascular haze.
 No pneumothorax can be identified.  No new localized discrete densities can be
 identified in comparison with the previous study.  To eliminate the
 possibility of pneumonic infiltrate on this portable chest examination with
 patient, the larger effusions and pulmonary congestion is not feasible.
