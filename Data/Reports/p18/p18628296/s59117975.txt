 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasogastric tube now courses below the diaphragm and is coiled projecting
 over the stomach.  The right internal jugular central line and endotracheal
 tube are in satisfactory position.  Lung volumes are slightly diminished and
 there are now faint patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis given
 the lower lung volumes.  Clinical correlation is recommended as aspiration
 should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
