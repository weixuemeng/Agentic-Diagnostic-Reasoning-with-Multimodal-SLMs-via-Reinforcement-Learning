                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD s/p PCI  // Dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  The heart is severely enlarged, unchanged
 compared to prior study.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 aorta remains tortuous.  There is increased pulmonary edema bilaterally. 
 Bibasilar opacities have increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary edema, increased prior study, worse on the left.  Early
 pneumonia would be difficult to recognize.
 2. Increased bibasilar opacities likely secondary to increased pulmonary
 edema, atelectasis, and small pleural effusions.
