 lymphadenopathy is better assessed on the previous CT.  Mild asymmetric
 pulmonary edema on the left has developed in the interval with increased size
 of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  Moderate
 multilevel degenerative changes are demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
