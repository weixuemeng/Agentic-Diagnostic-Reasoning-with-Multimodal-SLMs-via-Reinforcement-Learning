                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right shoulder pain and chest pain. 
 Question rib fracture, shoulder dislocation or fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two AP views only of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Please note the right shoulder is not completely visualized or
 evaluated on this film.  The lungs show no signs of consolidation, however,
 there does appear to be an approximately 6-mm dense nodule in the right lower
 lung field, likely a calcified granuloma.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged in size.  No
 displaced rib fractures seen on these films. There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. No displaced rib fracture seen. If
 there is continued concern for a rib fracture, a dedicated rib series may be
 obtained.
