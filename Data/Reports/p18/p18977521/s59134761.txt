                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p lobectomy for h/o lung cx, with COPD, PNA,
 NSTEMI  // eval pulm edema, effusion, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Configuration of the chest is distorted by thoracic scoliosis, stabilization
 rods in place are not evaluated by this study.
 
 There appears to been than right upper lobectomy, resulting in right apical
 pleural thickening and severe elevation of the right hilus.  The extent of
 circumferential pleural thickening is hard to assess in the absence of prior
 chest radiographs although presence of calcification suggests long-term
 chronicity.  The overexpanded right lower lung is clear of focal abnormality,
 as is the left lung. Heart is not enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable. .
