                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer s/p biopsy  // r/o PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest with contrast from ___ ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal opacity in the right lower lobe is partially due to known lung cancer
 but may also have some component of hemorrhage from the recent biopsy. 
 Apparent rightward deviation of the trachea may partially be due to patient
 positioning.  A thin curvilinear pleural line is seen in the right apex, but
 unlikely to be pneumothorax as lung markings are seen beyond it. The left lung
 is clear.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal opacity in the right lower lobe is partially due to known lung cancer
 but may also have some component of hemorrhage from recent biopsy.  No
 pneumothorax.
