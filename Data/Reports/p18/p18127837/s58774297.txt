                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/lung CA presenting with a fall, also has new murmur on
 exam, please assess for heart failure  // ___F w/lung CA presenting with a
 fall, also has new murmur on exam, please assess for heart failure
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to chest CT from ___ and chest
 radiograph from ___ from___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient has a known right-sided lymphangitic carcinomatosis, better assessed
 on CT.  Right middle lobe on right base opacity most likely relates to chronic
 consolidation as seen on prior studies.  Lateral left base subcentimeter
 rounded nodular opacity was also present on the chest CT from ___. 
 Additional, left lower lobe ground-glass opacities was also seen on prior CT. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe opacities also seen
 on prior CT ; while it is difficult to accurately compare extent given
 differences in modality, radiographic findings are likely similar to those
 seen on recent prior chest CT.  New small underlying consolidation is
 difficult to exclude.
