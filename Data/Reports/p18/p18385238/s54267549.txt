                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:38 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man, now with chest pain after TIPS.  Consider
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart is top normal size. 
 Azygos distention could be a function of hepatofugal flow.  Mild narrowing of
 the thoracic trachea is probably a function of chronic lung disease.  Lungs
 are clear.  Pulmonary vasculature mildly engorged.
