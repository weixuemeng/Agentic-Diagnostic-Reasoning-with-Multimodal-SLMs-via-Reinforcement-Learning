  Significant improvement in the right-sided opacities, reflecting decrease in
  edema and the large pleural effusion.  No knee opacities suggestive of
  pneumonia at this time although underlying a right-sided opacities are
  difficult to exclude.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with ESRD, multiple transfusions, oxygen
 requirement, and low grade fever.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer leads are in standard position, in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are low
 lung volumes.  There has been significant improvement in the right-sided
 opacities due to improvement in large pleural effusion and presumed asymmetric
 edema.  There are persistent consolidations in the right lower lobe and in the
 right perihilar region.  Superimposed infection or hemorrhage cannot be
 excluded.  In the left lung, there is mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
