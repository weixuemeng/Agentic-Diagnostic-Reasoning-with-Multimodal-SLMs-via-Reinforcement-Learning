                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:22.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question pleural effusion and pulmonary
 edema, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 11:54.
 
 Semi-supine chest film ___ at 5:22 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A dual-lead right-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart remains
 enlarged, unchanged in configuration favoring cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal
 contours remain stably widened.  There is calcification of the aortic knob
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  There has been interval worsening with
 near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax as well as appearance of
 prominent vasculature in the left hilum.  These findings suggest superimposed
 moderate pulmonary edema as well as possible interval increase in size of a
 right pleural effusion.  Superimposed infectious process would be less likely
 given the acute changes over a two-day period.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Multiple subacute right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  No
 large pneumothorax is seen on this semi-supine study.
