                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Left PICC has been removed.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Multiple clips are
 demonstrated within the left breast.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 representative of atelectasis.
