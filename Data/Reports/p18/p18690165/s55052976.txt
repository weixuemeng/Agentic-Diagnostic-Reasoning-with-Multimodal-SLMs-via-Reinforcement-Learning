                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dry cough and history of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Once again, there is a globular shaped heart that is enlarged,
 slightly more so than in ___, but stable from 3 days prior.  There has been a
 redistrubtion of the right pleural effusion on this upright radiograph.
 Additional opacities in the right lower lobe are likely adjacent atelectasis. 
 Calcified plaque is noted in multiple areas including the left lower lobe as
 well as the pleural surfaces overlying the right middle lobes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Moderate sized right pleural effusion, similar to prior CT.   
 2. Cardiomegaly with globular shape partially due to pericardial effusion as
 was noted on the CT from two days prior.
