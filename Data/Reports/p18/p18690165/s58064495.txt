                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion with thoracentesis on the right.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with the study of ___, there may be a small amount of
 pleural fluid at the right base, though this could represent pleural
 thickening.  There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 essentially normal pulmonary vessels.  This discrepancy raises the possibility
 of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia identified.
 
 There appears to be a densely calcified granuloma at the left base laterally.
