 pleural effusions are noted, small in size with associated compressive lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly is stable, mild.  Mediastinal contour is
 normal.  Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob is noted.  There
 is no overt pulmonary edema, though mild congestion is difficult to exclude. 
 No convincing signs of pneumonia or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.

 the right axilla/subclavian region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly, stable with small bilateral pleural effusions
