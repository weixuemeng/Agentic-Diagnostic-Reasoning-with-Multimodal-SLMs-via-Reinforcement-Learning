                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with seizures and agitation.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 again seen a vague opacity at the left base which is equivocal for atelectasis
 or developing infiltrate.  This is unchanged.  No pneumothoraces are
 identified.  Bony structures are intact.
