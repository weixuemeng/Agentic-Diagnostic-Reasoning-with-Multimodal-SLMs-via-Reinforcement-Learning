                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates markedly
 low lung volumes.  There is a retrocardiac opacity.  The right lung and left
 upper lung are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a possible left
 pleural effusion.  Top normal heart size is unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes makes evaluation limited.  However, there is
 left retrocardiac opacity which may be technical but cannot exclude subtle
 aspiration.  Correlate clinically.
