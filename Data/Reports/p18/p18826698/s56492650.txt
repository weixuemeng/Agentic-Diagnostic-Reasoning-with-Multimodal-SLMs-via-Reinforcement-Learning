 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with increased seizure activity.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are again
 noted.  There is, however, asymmetric left basilar opacity, even more
 conspicuous on the lateral view.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Asymmetric left basilar opacity which may be
 due to atelectasis given low lung volumes, however, infection is possible as
 well.  Clinical correlation is advised.
