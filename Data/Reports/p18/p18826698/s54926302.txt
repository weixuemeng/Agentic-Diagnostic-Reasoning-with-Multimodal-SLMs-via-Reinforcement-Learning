                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with seizure, now presents with dizziness.  Prior chest
 x-ray suggests aspiration.  To evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest x-rays were acquired.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Poor inspiratory effort.  Within this limitation, the heart size may
 still be at the upper limits of normal for size.  The lungs are grossly clear.
 Blunting along the left costophrenic sulcus probably reflects an epicardial
 fat pad.  There is no definitive aspiration identified.  The left retrocardiac
 area is better seen on today's study and appears grossly clear.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No good evidence of acute finding.
