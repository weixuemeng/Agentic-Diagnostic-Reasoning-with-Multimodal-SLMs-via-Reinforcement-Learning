                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Feeling unwell with possible seizure activity, question
 pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low, and the heart appears top normal in size.  There is crowding
 of bronchovasculature in the lower lungs likely accounting for the subtle
 increased opacity without definite signs of aspiration or pneumonia.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Bony structures appear intact.  Bony
 hypertrophy at the left distal clavicle is partially imaged, though represents
 a chronic abnormality as seen on multiple prior radiographs.
