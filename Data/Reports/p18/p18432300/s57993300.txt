                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery
 disease and new cough and atrial flutter.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Left lower lobe consolidation is demonstrated on both PA and lateral views
 most likely associated with small amount of pleural effusion and is highly
 concerning for pneumonia.  Rest of the lungs are clear.  The patient is after
 median sternotomy and CABG.  There is top normal heart and unremarkable
 mediastinal width.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence
 of failure.  There is no pneumothorax.
