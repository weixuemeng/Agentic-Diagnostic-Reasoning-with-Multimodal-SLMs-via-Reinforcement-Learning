                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe pancreatitis with new O2 requirement 
 // eval for pulmonary edema, effusion      eval for pulmonary edema, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes with
 increased opacification at the bases consistent with pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis. Prominence of interstitial markings could reflect
 mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure or merely be a manifestation of
 the low lung volumes.
