                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Ascites and liver disease, presenting with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for low lung volumes, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Streaky minor
 opacities in the lower lungs suggest minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The bony
 structures are unremarkable.  Views of the upper abdomen are limited but show
 air-fluid levels within the bowel of the epigastric region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Low lung volumes with minor
 basilar atelectasis.  Non-specific air-fluid levels in the epigastric region.
