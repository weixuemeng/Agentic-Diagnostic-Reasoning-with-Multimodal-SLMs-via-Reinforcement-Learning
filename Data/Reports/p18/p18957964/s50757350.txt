                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is limited by low
 lung volumes and the patient's positioning and kyphosis.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  There are bilateral perihilar ill-defined opacities,
 similar in appearance to prior radiograph and consistent with pulmonary edema.
 The lung bases are poorly assessed secondary to kyphosis. The
 cardiomediastinal contour appears similar to prior radiograph. No large
 pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged pulmonary edema.
