                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to patient positioning and kyphosis.  Assessment of
 the lung apices is obscured due to the patient's chin and neck soft tissues
 projecting over these regions.
 
 Heart size is moderately enlarged.  Bilateral perihilar ill-defined opacities
 with vascular indistinctness is compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No large pneumothorax
 is seen though assessment is limited.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflective of atelectasis is noted.  Mild loss of height anteriorly of a
 vertebral body at the thoracolumbar lumbar junction is age indeterminate. 
 Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and probable bibasilar atelectasis.
