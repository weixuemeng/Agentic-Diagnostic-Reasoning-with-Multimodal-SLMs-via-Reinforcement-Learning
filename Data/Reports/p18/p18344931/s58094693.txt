                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post wedge resection of the right apex.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position terminating adjacent to the
 right heart border.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is a stable, small left pleural effusion.  Interval decrease in the small
 right apical pneumothorax.  Slight decrease in subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right supraclavicular region and slight increase in subcutaneous emphysema
 along the lateral right chest wall.  There is a new, expected postoperative
 fluid collection in the right apex.  Increased focal opacity at the right base
 is concerning for consolidation.  The gas-filled stomach is prominent and
 nasogastric tube placement could be considered for decompression.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval decrease in size of small right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Probable, new consolidation at the right base may reflect aspiration.
 3.  Prominent, gas-filled stomach.  Consider nasogastric tube placement for
 decompression.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ text ___ on ___ at 12:53 PM, 10 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
