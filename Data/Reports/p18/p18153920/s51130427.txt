  Little change in comparison to the prior study from the same day with stable
  appearance of ET tube in mid trachea, enteric tube in stomach, right IJ with
  tip at superior cavoatrial junction, and bilateal chest tube. A small right
  apical pneumothorax persists. On the left, no pneumothorax is currently
  visualized. Moderate air inclusions in the soft tissues bilaterally.  Coiled
  tube overlying the upper trachea is likely external.
