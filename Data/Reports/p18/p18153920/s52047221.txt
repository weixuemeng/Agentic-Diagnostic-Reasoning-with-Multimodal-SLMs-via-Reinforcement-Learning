                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation with thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been removal of substantial pleural fluid from the right with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Diffuse left effusion and bilateral parenchymal opacifications
 persist.  Endotracheal tube remains in good position, as does the Dobbhoff
 tube.
