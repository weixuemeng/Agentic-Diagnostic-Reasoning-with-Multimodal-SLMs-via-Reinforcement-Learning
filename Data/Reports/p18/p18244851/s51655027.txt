                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Due to extreme
 kyphotic posture, evaluation through the lung bases is somewhat limited. 
 Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
 There are bibasilar linear opacities, which appear stable from prior, may
 represent chronic scarring or atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly stable with a slightly unfolded thoracic aorta.  Bony
 structures are intact.  There is no compression fracture seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
