                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fevers and cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left-sided PICC is again seen with tip in the upper SVC.  When
 compared to prior, there has been interval development of a left mid-to-lower
 lung region of consolidation.  There is also subtle opacity at the right lung
 base as well.  Cardiac silhouette is stable in configuration.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are again notable for degenerative changes at the
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left mid-and-lower lung consolidation compatible with
 pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Subtle opacity at the right lung
 base could represent atelectasis or developing infiltrate as well.  Recommend
 repeat after treatment to document resolution.
