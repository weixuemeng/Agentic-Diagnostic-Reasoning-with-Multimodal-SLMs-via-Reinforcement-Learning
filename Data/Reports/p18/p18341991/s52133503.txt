                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough, likely microaspiration, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight
 improvement of the extent and severity of the pre-existing left parenchymal
 opacity.  The right parenchymal opacity, mainly in the perihilar and right
 lower lung areas, has almost completely resolved.  However, there is an
 unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.  As on the previous image, the presence of
 a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The left PICC line is in
 unchanged position.
