                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, now intubated.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior study
 demonstrates unchanged monitoring and support devices.  Heart size is enlarged
 and stable.  Lung volumes are slightly decreased with continued perihilar
 opacities and mild pulmonary edema.  There is a focus of new opacification at
 the right upper lobe which may be an artifact of patient positioning. Moderate
 right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued perihilar and bibasilar opacities concerning for
 aspiration and mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Right apical opacity which may be an artifact of patient positioning.
 Recommend repeat radiograph with patient upright, if possible.
