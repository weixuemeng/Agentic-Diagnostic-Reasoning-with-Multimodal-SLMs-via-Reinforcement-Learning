                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions s/p chest tube
 placements  // ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions s/p chest tube
 placements      ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions s/p chest
 tube placements
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the chest tubes remain in place
 bilaterally and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Specifically, no
 reaccumulation of pleural fluid is appreciated.  An area of more coalescent
 opacification at the right base is worrisome for developing aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia.
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular
 congestion.
