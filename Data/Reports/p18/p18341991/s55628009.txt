 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, left subclavian PICC line, bilateral pleural pigtail
 catheters, and nasogastric tube are unchanged, although the tip of the
 nasogastric tube is not identified.  No obvious pneumothorax, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. 
 Slightly worsening patchy opacity at the right base and in the periphery of
 the left mid lung could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia and asymmetric
 pulmonary edema should also be considered.  Heart remains stably enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
