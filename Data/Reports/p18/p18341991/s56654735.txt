 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:45 PM
  1. Again noted are a moderate right pleural effusion and bibasilar and hilar
  opacities which raise suspicion for aspiration and pulmonary edema. ET Tube
  and Enteric tube are stable. 
  
  2. Previously noted right upper lobe opacity is no longer visualized and 
  artifactual.
  
  3. Bilateral sulci appear deep but without evidence of a pneumothorax. A
  followup upright radiograph and correlation with clinical symptoms is
  recommended. 
  
  Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at the time of

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures with purulent secretions post-bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4:47 a.m.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the tip of the
 endotracheal tube approximately 3.5 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube is
 appropriately positioned.  Lung volumes have improved and right apical opacity
 that was previously seen is now resolved, likely artifactual.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  Continued perihilar and bibasilar opacities
 concerning for aspiration and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved bilateral aeration with moderate right pleural effusion
 and continued bibasilar and perihilar opacities.
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___, with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at the
 time of discovery at 10:45 p.m. on ___.
