                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.   Endotracheal tube projects over the
 thoracic midline with its tip located roughly 2.7 cm above the carina.  An NG
 tube courses into the left upper quadrant.  There is extensive confluent
 airspace consolidation within the right lung occupying the upper, mid and
 lower lung with sparing of the right apex.  Findings concerning for pneumonia
 or large volume aspiration.  There is mild congestion at the left pulmonary
 hilum with left perihilar opacities which could also represent multifocal
 sites of pneumonia though 2 background edema difficult to exclude.  The heart
 is top-normal though supine technique results in magnification.  Mediastinal
 contour unremarkable.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET and NG tubes positioned appropriately.  Extensive airspace consolidation
 within the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung concerning for
 extensive multifocal pneumonia versus aspiration.  Possible underlying
 edema/congestion.
