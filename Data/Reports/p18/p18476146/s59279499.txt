                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, increased oxygen
 requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and views of the
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged increased from previous
 examination.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema
 with increased ill-defined alveolar opacities in the right lung compared to
 the left, findings which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though
 superimposed infection is not completely excluded.  Streaky retrocardiac
 opacity may reflect atelectasis.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic.  There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions, if any.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is noted
 within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with possible trace bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Asymmetric ill-defined alveolar opacities in the right lung compared to the
 left may be a reflection of asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection is not
 excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S)  Follow up radiographs after diuresis are recommended for
 further assessment.
