                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tonic-clonic seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded. 
 Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes as is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 present.  There is are mild bibasilar opacities, most likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration
 at the lung bases is not completely excluded, and a repeat exam with improved
 inspiratory effort may be helpful in assessing the lung bases.
