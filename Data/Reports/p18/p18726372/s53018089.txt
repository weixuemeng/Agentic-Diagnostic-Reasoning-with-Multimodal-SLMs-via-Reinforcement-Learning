                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with unsteady gait  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Lung volumes are quite
 low limiting assessment.  Mildly increased ground-glass opacities are seen
 throughout both lungs with relative sparing of the apices which could reflect
 edema versus atypical infection in the right clinical setting.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable
 allowing for differences in technique.  Bony structures appear intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with subtle ground-glass opacities within the lungs concerning
 for edema or atypical infection.
