                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post seizure.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral films were obtained.  The patient was apparently
 nonverbal and these were the best images possible.  With this limitation in
 mind the film is interpreted.  Low lung volumes contribute to bibasilar vague
 opacities as does soft tissue attenuation from the breast.  No focal
 consolidations present concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The esophagus is mildly dilated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process given low lung
 volumes.
