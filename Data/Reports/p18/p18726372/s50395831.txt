                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are re- demonstrated.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky bibasilar
 airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis.  As before, infection or
 aspiration within the lung bases cannot be completely excluded.
