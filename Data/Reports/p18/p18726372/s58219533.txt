                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Bibasilar
 streaky opacities likely represent atelectasis; however, aspiration cannot be
 excluded.
