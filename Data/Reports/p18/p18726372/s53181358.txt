                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cognitive impairment with increased seizure activity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  There is
 likely bibasilar atelectasis given the low lung volumes, although underlying
 aspiration is not entirely excluded.  Consider repeat PA and lateral views
 with improved inspiratory effort when the patient is able for better
 assessment of the lung bases.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Subtle bibasilar opacities likely due to
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes; however, consider dedicated PA
 and lateral views with better inspiratory effort when patient able, for better
 evaluation of the lung bases.
