                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment of the lateral view is limited due to the patient's inability to
 raise her arms.  There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the
 cardiac silhouette which is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is demonstrated.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is present.  Mild bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Consider repeat PA and
 lateral views with improved inspiratory effort, when the patient is able, for
 better assessment of the lung bases.
