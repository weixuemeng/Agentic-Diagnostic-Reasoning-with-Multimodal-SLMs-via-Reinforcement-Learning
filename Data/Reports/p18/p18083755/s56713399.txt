 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with Wegener's, atrial fibrillation and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen is thickening and likely
 scarring along the right minor fissure.  Best seen on the lateral view is
 patchy consolidation projecting over the cardiac silhouette anteriorly which
 likely localizes to the right on the frontal exam.  Focal opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic angle is unchanged from prior.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle opacity in projecting over the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view
 has increased from prior exam and may represent infection or hemorrhage in
 this patient with history of vasculitis.
