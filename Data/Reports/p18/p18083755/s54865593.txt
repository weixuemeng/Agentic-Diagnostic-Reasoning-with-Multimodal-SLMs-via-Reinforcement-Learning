                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New hypoxia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, are identified, slightly
 increased since the prior study.  There is unchanged appearance of the right
 hilar opacity reflecting a combination of venous structures and right middle
 lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  For precise details, please
 review CT chest that was obtained the same day earlier.
