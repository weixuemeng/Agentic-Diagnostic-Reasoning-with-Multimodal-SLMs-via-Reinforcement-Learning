                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with afib, GPA, treated atpyical mycobacterial
 infection, admitted with pericardial effusion s/p drinaage  // s/p attempted
 self extubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evaluation of location of the endotracheal tube is difficult to assess due to
 the overlying catheters.  There is a new catheter projecting over the neck,
 likely external to the patient, which limits evaluation.  However the tip of
 the endotracheal tube appears to be 4 cm above the carina.  If there is high
 concern, repeat imaging could be obtained with displacement of externa
 catheters around the expected location the endotracheal tube.  The pacemaker,
 right IJ central line, and feeding tube appear unchanged position. Heart size
 is upper limits of normal.  There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity
 and left-sided pleural effusion.  There are no pneumothoraces.
