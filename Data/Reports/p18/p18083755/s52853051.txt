                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with status post lung biopsy.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 9:59.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 3:34 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right chest tube remains in place.  Very tiny right apical pneumothorax
 remains and appears to be even smaller than seen on ___.  Due to
 discrepancy in wet reading, results called to ___, the patient's nurse on
 ___ at 10:26am at time of discovery.  There has been interval decrease in
 lung volumes with patchy opacities at both bases which may reflect
 atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Chain sutures are again seen in the right mid lung in
 this patient status post recent lung biopsy.  Air within the right lateral
 chest wall soft tissues is consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.  No left
 pleural effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
