                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with atrial fibrillation status post recent
 cardioversion with dizziness and lightheadedness for 5 days.  Elevated white
 blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  Linear right upper lung opacity is
 compatible with scarring/ resection.  Small bilateral effusions have not
 significantly changed in size noting that they are now seen laterally at the
 costophrenic angles on the frontal view, more so when compared to prior. 
 There is no definite new focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Essentially unchanged bilateral pleural effusions without superimposed acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
