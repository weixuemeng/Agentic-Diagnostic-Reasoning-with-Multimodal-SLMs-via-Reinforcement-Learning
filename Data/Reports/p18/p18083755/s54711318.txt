                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post VATS, chest tube pulled,
 evaluate pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 3:34.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval removal of the right chest tube.  There is a stable tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  Postoperative changes are seen in the right mid lung where
 there are chain sutures.  Residual air seen within the right lateral chest
 wall consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.  There is improved overall
 aeration at the lung bases suggestive of resolving atelectasis.  No pulmonary
 edema.  There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may
 represent a small effusion or chronic pleural thickening.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  2-3 mm nodular opacity in the lateral
 left mid lung, but this does not appear to have a CT correlate on the study
 performed on ___ and therefore is of uncertain clinical significance. 
 Faint patchy rounded opacity in the right upper lobe likely corresponds to one
 of the nodules seen on the recent CT of ___.
