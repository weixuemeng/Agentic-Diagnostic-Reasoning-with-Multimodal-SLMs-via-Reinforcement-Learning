                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Severe abdominal pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 There is a very small pleural effusion on the right and a small one on the
 left with associated opacity, probably atelectasis.  Posterior left basilar
 opacification has increased somewhat; infectious process is not excluded. 
 Port-A-Cath appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left posterior basilar opacity, compatible with pleural effusion
 and atelectasis but not specific.  No free air identified.
