                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Pancreatic cancer and right-sided pleural pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip
 terminates most likely at the level of mid SVC, similar to before.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen and lungs are clear.  Note is made that the
 study neither confirms nor excludes the possibility of pulmonary embolism.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with CT pulmonary angiography has to be
 made.
