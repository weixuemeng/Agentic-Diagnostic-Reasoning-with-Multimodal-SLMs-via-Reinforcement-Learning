                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  Lung volumes are low.  There are persistent
 small pleural effusions, greater on the left than right, not significantly
 changed.  There is associated posterior basilar opacity which is somewhat
 increased but probably due to atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild increase in left posterior basilar opacity, probably compatible with
 atelectasis, associated with a pleural effusion although infectious etiology
 is not excluded by this examination.  Stable small pleural effusions.
