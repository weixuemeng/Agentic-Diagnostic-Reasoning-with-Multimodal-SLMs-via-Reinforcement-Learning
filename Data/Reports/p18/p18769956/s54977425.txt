                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Left-sided thoracentesis, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion has markedly decreased, now small.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable due to known right hilar mass.  Small right pleural effusion is
 associated with adjacent atelectasis.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has
 improved.
