                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L femur ORIF after fall, intubated for
 respiratory failure  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, scatter radiation related to the
 size of the patient again greatly obscures detail.  Monitoring support devices
 are unchanged.  There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  Hazy
 opacification in the right mid and lower lung with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial layering pleural effusion and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent
 with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
