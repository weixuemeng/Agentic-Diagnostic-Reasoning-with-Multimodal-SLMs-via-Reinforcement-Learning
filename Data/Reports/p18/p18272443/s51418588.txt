                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob, intermittent hypoxia (likely pickwickian, however
 would like to r/o new pathology).  Evaluate for progression of edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is somewhat limited by motion.  Lung volumes are low.  Increased vascular
 markings are likely related to low lung volumes and patient body habitus.  The
 asymmetric right upper lobe opacification is less apparent on the study. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or obvious pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes without focal consolidation.
 2. Cardiomegaly.
