                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post robotic transduodenal ampullary mass
 resection, status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Endotracheal tube is
 seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina.  An
 enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm extending to
 the expected location of the gastric fundus.  However, on the initial image,
 enteric tube appears to terminate at the distal esophagus/GE junction.  On a
 second image it appears to extend into the gastric fundus, although possibly
 with a sharp kink.  Repositioning is suggested.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion.  A trace right pleural effusion may also be present.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Enteric tube courses into the region of the proximal stomach with apparent
 sharp kink.  Suggest repositioning.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:20 a.m. on ___
 via telephone, 5 minutes after discovery.
