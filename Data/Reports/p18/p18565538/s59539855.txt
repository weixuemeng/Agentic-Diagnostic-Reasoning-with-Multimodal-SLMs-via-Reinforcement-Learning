                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure  // placement of
 esophageal balloon
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of earlier today, a left internal jugular catheter
 has been repositioned, now terminating in the proximal superior vena cava,
 with distal tip directed towards the lateral wall of the structure.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for improving multifocal opacities in the left lung,
 particularly decreased within the left retrocardiac area.  An ET tube is in
 standard position, and an esophageal catheter terminates within the proximal
 stomach.
