                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right subdural hemorrhage with midline shift.  The patient is
 intubated with new Dobbhoff tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 endotracheal tube is low, ending 1.5 cm above the carina.  This could be
 pulled back to avoid bronchial intubation.  A new Dobbhoff tube ends in the
 stomach.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Left basilar opacity
 is likely atelectasis.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube is 1.5 cm above the carina.  It could be pulled back to
 avoid bronchial intubation.
 
 ___ (___) was paged at 14:00 on ___ to convey the
 findings.
