                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.3 cm above the
 carina.  The right jugular pacer has been withdrawn and a sheath remains in
 place.  Nasogastric tube coils in the fundus of the stomach, then extends to
 the lower body of the stomach.  There may be mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure with minimal atelectatic changes at the bases.  
 
 No evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, though this is not a true upright
 view and this possibility can certainly not be excluded.  If there is serious
 clinical concern for perforation of the bowel, CT could be obtained.
