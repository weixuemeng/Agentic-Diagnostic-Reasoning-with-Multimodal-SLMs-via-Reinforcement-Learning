                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Failure of blood return on Port-A-Cath.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous chest radiographs are available.  There is extensive
 opacification in the right hilar and suprahilar regions.  This presumably
 relates to the primary tumor or hilar lymphadenopathy, possibly with
 post-obstructive changes.  Multiple nodular opacifications are seen as on the
 recent CT scan, consistent with metastases.  Specifically, the Port-A-Cath
 extends to the lower portion of the SVC or possibly upper part of the right
 atrium.  No evidence of significant kink or other abnormality in the catheter.
