                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer, oxygen desaturation, basal crackles.  Rule out edema
 or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The extensive left lung parenchymal opacities, consisting of both
 nodular and linear elements, are minimally progressive in extent.  There is
 mild blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small
 pleural effusion.  Finally, retrocardiac hypoventilation has developed. 
 Overall, the findings could be consistent with an infection, as already
 noticed on location of the last chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The appearance of the right lung is unremarkable.  No right pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax.
