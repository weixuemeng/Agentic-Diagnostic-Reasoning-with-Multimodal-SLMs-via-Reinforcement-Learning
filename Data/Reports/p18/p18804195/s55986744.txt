                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recent change in orogastric tube to nasogastric tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient remains intubated. A orogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but
 its gastric courses only measures about 5 cm. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged including leftward shift in mild volume loss
 at the left lung base with patchy associated opacification. Elsewhere, the
 lung fields remain clear. A small pleural effusion is hard to exclude on the
 left; no evidence for one on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach. However, if better purchase is
 desired, advancing the tube somewhat may be helpful.
