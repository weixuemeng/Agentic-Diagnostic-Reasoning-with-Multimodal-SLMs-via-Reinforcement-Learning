 unremarkable.  Linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar linear opacities likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.
