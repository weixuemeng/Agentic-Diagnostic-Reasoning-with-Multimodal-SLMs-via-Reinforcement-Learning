 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F increased O2 requirement in setting of blood product
 transfusion  // Evaluate for edema versus interval development of pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly lordotic positioning.

 prominence of the pulmonary arteries is similar to the prior study.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 There is a small to moderate size left pleural effusion, with underlying left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The effusion appears larger and the
 consolidation more dense than on the prior study.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to the prior study.
