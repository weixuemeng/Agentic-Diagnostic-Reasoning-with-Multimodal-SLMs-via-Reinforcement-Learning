                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  MVC with back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for low lung
 volumes.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.  No T-spine fracture is seen,
 although CT is more sensitive for detection of these.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute thoracic injury.
