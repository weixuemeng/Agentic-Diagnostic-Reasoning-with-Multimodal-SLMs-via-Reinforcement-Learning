                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, pancreatic cancer, worsening dyspnea on exertion and
 increasing O2 requirement, question pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is slight
 increase in left pleural effusion with associated compressive left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Given the view of the left pleural effusion on the lateral
 projection, there is a loculated component which tracks along the anterior and
 posterior pleural space.  Comparison is also made with a CT abdomen from
 ___.  The right lung remains clear.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Underlying emphysema is likely present.  Bony
 structures appear grossly intact.  Excreted contrast is noted in the upper
 collecting systems of the kidneys.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Loculated left pleural effusion, grossly unchanged with
 associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Emphysema again noted.
