                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest tube removal, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  Swan-Ganz catheter is
 still in place and has been advanced.  It should be pulled back by
 approximately 2-3 cm.  The extent of bilateral parenchymal atelectasis and
 pleural effusions have slightly decreased.  Unchanged, however, signs of
 moderate fluid overload and basal areas of atelectasis.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The mediastinal and chest tubes have
 been removed.
