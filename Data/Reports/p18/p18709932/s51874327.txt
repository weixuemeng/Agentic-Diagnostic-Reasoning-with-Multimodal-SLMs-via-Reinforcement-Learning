 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, assess pneumonia or widened mediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead

 pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, significantly worse compared
 with prior study.  Overall heart size is stable and mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contour is grossly stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bony
