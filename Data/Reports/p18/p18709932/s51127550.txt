                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Two days earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy, coronary artery bypass graft
 surgery and aortic valve replacement.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device
 appears unchanged, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle,
 respectively.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is asymmetric opacification of the
 right lung more so than left with an interstitial pattern suggesting an
 asymmetric form of vascular congestion, although overall similar to decreased,
 particularly in the left lung.  Posterior patchy basilar opacities are most
 suggestive of coinciding atelectasis.  There is a better defined opacity
 loculated along the right lower lateral chest wall, suggestive of a loculated
 pleural effusion.  There is also a small pleural effusion on the left.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased opacification, particularly in the left lung,
 suggesting improvement in pulmonary congestion.  Better definition of basilar
 opacity suggesting pleural effusions, loculated on the right side to some
 degree.
