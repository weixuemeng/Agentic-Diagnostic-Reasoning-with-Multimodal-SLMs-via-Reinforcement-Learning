                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well-expanded
 lungs.  Heart is top normal in size and cardiomediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  Again seen are linear opacities at the right lung base with
 streaky opacities also seen in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view
 which could reflect atelectasis, scarring, or infection. Increased density in
 the inferolateral aspect of the right lung and potentially posterior aspect of
 the left lung could relate to pleural thickening.  There is no pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax.  Again, note is made of sternotomy wires and a
 pacemaker with leads in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Pleural thickening along the lateral aspect of the right lung and posterior
 left lung with underlying streaky opacities at the right base could reflect
 scarring, atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 2. If there is no prior film for comparison to document stability of these
 findings, CT is recommended for further evaluation non-urgently.
