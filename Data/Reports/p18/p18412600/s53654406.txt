                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Small-bowel obstruction.  Evaluate position of nasogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 subsegmental bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of the
 diaphragm, curving superiorly to end in the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enteric catheter ends within the superior aspect of the gastric fundus.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes, with minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
