 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of a substantial
 pneumothorax.  Right pleural effusion has apparently resolved.  Catheter
 overlying the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may potentially be in the
 lower pleural space, but a lateral chest radiograph would be helpful in this
 regard if warranted clinically.  Again demonstrated is a large cavitary right
 upper lobe mass with associated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well
 as distal post-obstructive changes.  Hyperexpanded lungs are demonstrated with
 associated upper lobe predominant emphysema.  Nonspecific opacities at the
 left base probably represent atelectasis.
