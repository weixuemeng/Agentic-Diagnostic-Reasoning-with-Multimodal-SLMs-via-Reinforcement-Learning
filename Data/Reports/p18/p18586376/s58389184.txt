                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung mass and  SVC syndrome.  Evaluate lung mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a large cavitating mass in the right upper lobe which is invading the
 mediastinum and compromising the SVC and right pulmonary artery. Note is made
 of extensive systemic collaterals.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise within normal limits.  Emphysematous changes are seen in the
 left lung.  There is a small right sided pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Large cavitating mass in the right upper lobe which conforms to findings on
 subsequent chest CT examination.
 
 2. Small right sided pleural effusion.
