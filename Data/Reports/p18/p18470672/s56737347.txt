                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cutaneous lymphoma, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Low lung volumes most likely account for the
 mild prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is no evidence
 of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
