                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is normal.  The lungs are
 essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  On
 the lateral view, there is questionable nodule projecting anteriorly and the
 potentially may be obscured by the sternum on the PA view.  This finding
 cannot be seen on the prior examinations and thus correlation with chest CT is
 recommended.
