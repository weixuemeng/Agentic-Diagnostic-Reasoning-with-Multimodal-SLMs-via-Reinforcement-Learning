                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Although the tracheal air column is well visualized throughout most
 of its course, there is apparent filling defect in the lower trachea at the
 level of the carina and origin of left main bronchus.  Heart size, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except for focal linear
 atelectasis versus scar at left lung base peripherally.  No pleural effusion
 or acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable intraluminal opacity within the lower trachea at
 origin of left main bronchus.  Given history of hemoptysis, further evaluation
 with chest CT is recommended, as entered into radiology communications
 dashboard on ___.
