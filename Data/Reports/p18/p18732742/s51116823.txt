                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confusion, tachypnea, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is available for comparison.  Reference
 made to CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the right atrium.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 right basal opacity suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, 
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Small pulmonary nodules seen on
 prior CTs are better evaluated on CT.  There is slight prominence of the
 interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  No left pleural
 effusion is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Right basal opacity may be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if
 patient able.  Slight prominence of the interstitium bilaterally could be due
 to minimal interstitial edema.
