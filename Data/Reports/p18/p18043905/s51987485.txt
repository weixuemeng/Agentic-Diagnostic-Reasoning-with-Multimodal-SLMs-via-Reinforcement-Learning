                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Mild enlargement of the hila bilaterally is compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy which was better demonstrated on the prior CT, and is
 unchanged.  Regions of scarring within the right apex and left lung base
 appear relatively unchanged, with pleural thickening overlying the right
 apical lateral lung redemonstrated.  Increased patchy opacities however are
 demonstrated in both lung bases.  This could reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increasing patchy opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific, and could
 reflect areas of atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  Regions of
 scarring in the right apex and left lung base appear relatively unchanged.
