                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right subclavian central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15 25 chest radiograph, chest CT ___ at
 18:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 Widening of the superior mediastinum, particularly the right paratracheal
 stripe, corresponds to lymphadenopathy and ill-defined soft tissue density
 within the mediastinum, better assessed on recent CT. Mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema is new compared to the prior radiograph with a layering
 moderate size right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, also new
 from prior. Worsening opacification of the lung bases, particularly on the
 left with air bronchograms, reflect regions of compressive atelectasis as seen
 on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right subclavian central venous catheter tip in the mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, new compared to the prior radiograph,
 with moderate layering right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
 3. Worsening opacification of the lung bases, more so on the left, compatible
 with areas of compressive atelectasis.
 4. Abnormal widening of the superior mediastinal contour, correlating to
 lymphadenopathy and abnormal soft tissue density within the mediastinum as
 seen on the prior CT.
