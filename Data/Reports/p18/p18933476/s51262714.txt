                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-sized left apical lateral pneumothorax is similar to
 prior study with indwelling chest tube remaining in place.  Right chest tube
 also is present, with no definite right pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable considering positional differences of the patient. 
 Right-sided septal thickening is worse compared to the prior study and could
 reflect asymmetrical edema.  Additionally, a left retrocardiac opacity has
 slightly worsened and likely represents atelectasis as well.  Small left and
 moderate right pleural effusions are again demonstrated with apparent partial
 loculation of the right pleural effusion.
