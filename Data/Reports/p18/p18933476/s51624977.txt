 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:26 AM
  
  
  
  Similar appearance of small right pneumothorax. No large left pneumothorax
  following removal of left pleural tube. Curvilinear density along the left
  mediastinal border may represent persistent contusion from pleural tube. Left
  PICC appears slightly withdrawn compared to the prior exam, now terminating at
  the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, but this may be related
  to patient / arm positioning.
