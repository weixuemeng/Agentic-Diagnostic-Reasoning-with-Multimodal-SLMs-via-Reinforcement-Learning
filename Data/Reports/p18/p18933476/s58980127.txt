                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain and pleural effusions.  //
 Please evaluate for placement of chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior plain film study dated ___ as well
 as selected images from a barium swallow performed on ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement a right chest tube with decrease in size of the pleural
 effusion and improved aeration of the right lung but interval appearance of a
 small right apical lateral pneumothorax.  The right subclavian line is
 unchanged in position.  Residual contrast is seen within the esophagus and
 stomach. In addition, radiopaque material is seen overlying the left apex
 which when correlated with the recent barium swallow is extrinsic and related
 to spillage. There continues to be abnormal right paratracheal soft tissue
 which is known represent lymphadenopathy. There is persistent retrocardiac
 consolidation with associated effusion likely representing partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is a residual patchy
 opacity at the right base also likely reflecting atelectasis. In addition, the
 pulmonary vasculature on the left is somewhat more ill defined raising concern
 for a component component of superimposed interstitial edema. Clinical
 correlation is advised.
