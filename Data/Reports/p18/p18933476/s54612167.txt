                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R chest tube, L pleural effusion now s/p L
 chest tube  // please eval for interval change      please eval for interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 10:52
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left chest tube with appearance of a small left apical
 and lateral pneumothorax. There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation
 with a probable associated small effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered in the
 correct clinical setting.  The right chest tube and right subclavian line are
 unchanged in position. No right-sided pneumothorax is appreciated. However,
 there is right apical lateral pleural thickening which may represent a
 component of loculated fluid.  Patchy opacity at the right base favors
 atelectasis ,although again pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.  There
 is widening of the superior mediastinum on the left in the region of the
 distal portion of the chest tube with obliteration of the aortic knob. This
 could represent an area of left upper upper lobe atelectasis, although
 hemorrhage related to chest tube placement should also be considered. This can
 be better assessed on followup imaging.  The heart remains stably enlarged.
