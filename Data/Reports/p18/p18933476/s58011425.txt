                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, dyspnea, slightly worse. Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 21:26 and chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central venous catheter is in unchanged position, terminating at
 the mid SVC. There is persistent opacification of the right lung base, likely
 secondary to moderate sized pleural effusion. Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is likely secondary to a small pleural effusion. Widening
 of the upper mediastinum correlates with lymphadenopathy and soft tissue
 density within the mediastinum as seen on prior CT. No definite pneumothorax
 seen on this portable semi-erect chest radiograph. Pulmonary edema has
 slightly improved, now mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant pneumothorax seen on this portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
