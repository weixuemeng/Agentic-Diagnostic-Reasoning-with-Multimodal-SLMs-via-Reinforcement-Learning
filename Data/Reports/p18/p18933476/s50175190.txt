 The right subclavian central line and right chest tube remain in place. There
 has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There is a stable right apical lateral
 pneumothorax. Mild interstitial edema has improved. There is a small layering
 left effusion with retrocardiac consolidation which may reflect atelectasis,
 although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered given the presence
 of air bronchograms.  Right paratracheal soft tissue is stable consistent with
 known lymphadenopathy.  There is slight improvement in aeration at the right
 lung base. Overall cardiac contour is stable.
