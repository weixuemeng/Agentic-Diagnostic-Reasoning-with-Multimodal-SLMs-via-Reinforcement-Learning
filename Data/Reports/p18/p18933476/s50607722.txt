                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD___ s/p total thyroidectomy with septic shock
 unclear source, CT chest with pleural effusions and question mediastinitis  //
 evidence of worsening pleural effusion or possible mediastinitis?     evidence
 of worsening pleural effusion or possible mediastin
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification in
 the right hemithorax consistent with worsening pleural effusions and
 compressive atelectasis involving the right lower lobe.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Small effusion is seen on this side. Irregular opacification in the right
 paratracheal region is consistent with lymphadenopathy as seen on the prior
 CT.  Central catheter remains in place.
