 As compared to the previous radiograph, the known postprocedural right
 pneumothorax is unchanged in extent and severity. The minimal right pleural
 effusion and subsequent atelectasis is also constant.  On the left, no
 pneumothorax is noted.  The left pleural effusion, however, appears to have
 minimally increased.  There has been a further slight pulling back of the left
 PICC line. The tip of the line now projects over the midline.
