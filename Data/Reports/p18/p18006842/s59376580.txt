                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for edema or
 consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, no change in the left-sided pacer device and
 AICD lead placement.  Severe cardiomegaly is again seen, now with moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema, worse since the prior study.  Retrocardiac opacity
 makes it difficult to exclude developing left lower lobe infection.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening pulmonary edema and retrocardiac opacity.  Given worsening
 retrocardiac opacity, left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely
 excluded.
