                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, dyspnea, chest pressure  // evaluate
 for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Triple lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads in the expected positions
 of the right ventricle, coronary sinus, and right atrium.  The cardiac
 silhouette is markedly enlarged. The size of the cardiac silhouette appears
 increased as compared to the prior study although this may in part relate to a
 AP, portable technique. There is prominence of the hila and central pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting vascular engorgement and pulmonary vascular congestion
 with possible mild edema. . No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, appears increased in size
 compared the prior study, however, this may relate to AP, portable technique.
 Underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion not excluded.
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement, pulmonary vascular congestion.
