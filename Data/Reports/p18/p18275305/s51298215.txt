                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sob  // ?pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 00:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC without evidence
 of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Patchy right basilar opacity
 likely represent atelectasis given that it was not present 7 hr earlier. There
 are small bilateral pleural effusions, better appreciated on pre seeding CT. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, accentuated by AP
 technique and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are stable.
