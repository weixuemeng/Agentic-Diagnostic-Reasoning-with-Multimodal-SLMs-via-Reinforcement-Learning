                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are relatively low, accentuating the cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind,
 heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Heterogeneous bilateral lung
 opacities have partially resolved, with residual opacities most prominent in
 the right upper and both mid lung regions. These residual lung findings may
 reflect aspiration or infectious pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
