                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female with increasing seizure frequency.  Evaluate
 for infectious process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular
 structures and accentuation of the cardiac silhouette.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is noted.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild prominence the cardiac silhouette is unchanged compared with ___
 and could be accentuated due to low inspiratory volumes and lordotic
 positioning.
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is also relate to low
 lung volumes.  Allowing for this, no focal infiltrate or consolidation.
