 region likely corresponds to known underlying mass lesion.  It is not seen on
 the frontal likely due to rotation.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 is unchanged.  Known right hilar adenopathy is not clearly delineated due to
 rotation on the frontal view
