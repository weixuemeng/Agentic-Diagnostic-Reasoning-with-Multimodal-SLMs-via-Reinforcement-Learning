 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right central venous line tip is at the level of lower SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  There is interval development of diffuse parenchymal
 opacities, potentially representing pulmonary edema versus TRALLI. the diffuse
 nature of the process and the rapidity of its development would make
 infectious process unlikely.
