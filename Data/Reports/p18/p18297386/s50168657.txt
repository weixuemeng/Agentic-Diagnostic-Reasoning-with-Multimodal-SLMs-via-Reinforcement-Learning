                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, evaluate for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette including mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral
 interstitial opacities likely a combination of known lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis and mild superimposed pulmonary edema is relatively unchanged. 
 There is, however, increased more confluent opacification at both bases with
 increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slightly increased bilateral moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis/consolidation.
 2.  Stable appearance of diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities likely
 reflecting a combination of known lymphangitic carcinomatosis and mild
 superimposed edema.
