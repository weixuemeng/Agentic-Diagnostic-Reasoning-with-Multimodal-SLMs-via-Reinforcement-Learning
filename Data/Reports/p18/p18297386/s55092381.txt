                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion, s/p R chest tube  // assess for
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral chest tubes are again seen in changed position as compared to
 radiograph from ___.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly unchanged.  Again seen are
 diffuse reticulonodular airspace opacities consistent with widespread
 metastatic disease with more confluent areas in the right mid and lower lung.
 There is improved aeration of the left lower lobe, with improved visualization
 of the left hemidiaphragm and retrocardiac areas.
 
 Better appreciated on this study is a localized right anterior
 hydro-pneumothorax, with air-fluid level best seen on lateral view in the
 retrosternal region.  Moderate size of right effusion is unchanged since prior
 radiograph.  There is also an unchanged small left pleural effusion.  There is
 no left-sided pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right anterior loculated hydro-pneumothorax; overall unchanged size of right
 pleural effusion. Stable small left pleural effusion but interval improvement
 in left lower lobe opacification.
