                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right Pleurx catheter terminates in the thoracoabdominal junction
 on the right, likely within the lower right pleural cavity.  Moderate-to-large
 right pleural effusion is similar to recent chest radiograph performed less
 than two hours earlier.  Adjacent atelectasis of right middle and lower lobes
 is again demonstrated.  Widespread reticular and nodular opacities suggestive
 of diffuse metastatic disease are also similar as well as a small left pleural
 effusion.
