                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of renal cancer, atrial fibrillation, recent pericardial
 window with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Worsening interstitial opacities are demonstrated likely reflecting
 superimposed mild pulmonary edema on a background of lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis. Small right pleural effusion has increased in size compared to
 the previous exam, with the left small pleural effusion remaining unchanged.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no
 pneumothorax. More focal opacities within the lung bases bilaterally likely
 reflect known lung masses as seen on the prior CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening interstitial opacities likely reflective of superimposed mild
 pulmonary edema on a background of lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased in size on the right.
