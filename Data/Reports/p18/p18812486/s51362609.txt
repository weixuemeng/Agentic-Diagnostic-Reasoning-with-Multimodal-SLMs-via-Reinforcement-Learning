 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with HCV and cirrhosis and decompensation. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate improved lung volumes and
 edema when compared to chest radiograph dated ___.  There is a
 vague peribronchiolar infiltration within the left mid to lower lung, likely
 lingula, that has not cleared.  This may represent resolving pneumonia. 
 Top-normal heart size with tortuous aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cleared edema.
 
 2.  Possibly resolving pneumonia within the left mid and lower lung.
