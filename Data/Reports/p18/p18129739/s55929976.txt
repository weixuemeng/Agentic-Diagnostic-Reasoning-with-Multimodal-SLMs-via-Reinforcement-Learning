                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower than on the previous study.  This accentuates the size
 of the cardiac silhouette which is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 present without pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases, more so on the left, likely reflective of areas of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  No definite displaced
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
