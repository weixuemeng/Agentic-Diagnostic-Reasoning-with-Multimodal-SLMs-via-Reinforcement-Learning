                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sickle cell and chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The catheter of the left chest wall
 port terminates in the lower IVC.  An apparent acute kink along the proximal
 course of the catheter is likely projectional.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Apparent kink along the proximal course of the port catheter is likely
 projectional and can be easily correlated with port function.
