                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sickle cell and chest pain 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest.  
 
 The lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  A Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the mid SVC and on today's exam demonstrates a small loop near
 the clavicle; this was not present on the prior radiograph and may simply be
 projectional. 
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
