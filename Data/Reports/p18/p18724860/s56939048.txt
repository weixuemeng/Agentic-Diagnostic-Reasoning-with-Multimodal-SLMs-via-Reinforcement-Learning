                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acetabular fracture, preop evaluation.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 Chest films obtained supine, due to limited patient mobility.  Allowing for
 this, the heart size is borderline enlarged.  Prominence of upper zone vessels
 likely relates to supine technique.  Right paratracheal opacity likely
 represents confluence of vascular and osseous shadows -- however. attention to
 this area on followup upright film would be recommended to confirm this.  No
 CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.  No supine film evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Two small rounded densities at the left lung base, one
 lateral in the midzone and one at the left lung base, appear to represent
 confluence of vascular and osseous shadows.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt acute pulmonary process.  Please see comment.
