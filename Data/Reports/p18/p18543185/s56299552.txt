                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shoulder and neck pain with vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size is
 moderately enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal contour is stable with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Prominent right upper
 paratracheal bulge is due to the presence of tortuous vessels and remains
 unchanged.  Hilar contours remain enlarged compatible with pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.   Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Prominent bilateral interstitial markings and
 patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect an element of mild pulmonary
 edema, though infection or aspiration the lung bases cannot be completely
 excluded.  Minimal fluid is seen along the right major fissure.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable mild pulmonary edema although aspiration or infection at the lung
 bases cannot be completely excluded.  Followup radiographs after diuresis are
 recommended for further assessment.
