                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New atrial fibrillation.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a retrocardiac opacity, seems to correlate with a
 small left-sided pleural effusion and associated parenchymal opacity that can
 probably be attributed to atelectasis.  Pneumonia is also a differential
 consideration, however.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on the
 right.  A nodule in the lingula on the prior CT torso is not well demonstrated
 on this examination. Sclerotic bony metastases are widespread.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Suspected left-sided pleural effusion with parenchymal opacity, for which
 differential considerations include associated compressive atelectasis or
 potentially pneumonia in the appropriate setting.  
 
 2.  Widespread osseous metastatic disease.  
 
 3.  Non-visualization of nodule in the lingula, probably metastatic, from the
 prior CT; whether this represents a decrease due to treatment or a limitation
 of radiographic technique is uncertain.
