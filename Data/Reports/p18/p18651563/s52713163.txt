                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever for three days.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 demonstrate subtle wispy opacity in the left upper lobe, not present on prior
 exam.  Flattened hemidiaphragms suggest chronic obstructive disease.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral glenohumeral joint
 degenerative changes are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle wispy opacity in the left upper lobe may represent early
 pneumonia; recommend follow-up to resolution to exclude underlying mass.
