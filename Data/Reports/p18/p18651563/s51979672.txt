                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:36
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, concern for pneumonia, evaluate for
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:01.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the
 distal SVC.  There is worsening airspace disease involving both the lungs, but
 more confluent in the left mid and lower lung than the right base and right
 upper lung.  These findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia, although
 could represent an atypical presentation of severe pulmonary edema.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  There are likely small layering effusions, left
 greater than right.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours remain unchanged.
