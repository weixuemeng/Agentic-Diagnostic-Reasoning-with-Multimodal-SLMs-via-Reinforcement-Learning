                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening productive cough and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta redemonstrated.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases are similar when compared to the prior exam and likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of
 atelectasis, and similar when compared to the prior study.  Infection or
 aspiration at the lung bases, however, cannot be completely excluded.
