                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal pain, back pain for 2 weeks now with
 persistent abdominal pain, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the previous study which accentuates the size
 of the cardiac silhouette which is top normal. The thoracic aorta is mildly
 tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is normal and the hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis, without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is visualized. Partially imaged is cervical spinal fusion hardware. No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected. No free air is noted under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
