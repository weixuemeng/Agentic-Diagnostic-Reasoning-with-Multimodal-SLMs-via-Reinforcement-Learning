                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with worsening cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia if present after being volume depleted.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  Moderate cardiac enlargement persists and
 appearance of thoracic aorta is unchanged.  There is a moderately improved
 inspirational effort with better aeration of the lung fields bilaterally in
 comparison with the previous examination.  Less marked crowding of pulmonary
 vasculature and lesser degree of perivascular haze.  The lateral pleural
 sinuses remain free and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  No signs of any discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate on this
 portable AP single view chest examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary vasculature appearance related to
 successful dehydration measures during the latest one day examination
 interval.
 
 No evidence of acute parenchymal pneumonic infiltrates as can be excluded on
 single view examination.
