                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy and linear opacity at the right lung base
 with associated mild volume loss favors atelectasis.  No definite pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy and linear right basilar opacity probably represents
 atelectasis and less likely a focus of aspiration or early pneumonia. 
 Followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
