                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, please evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  Bilateral low lung volumes evident
 with minimally increased retrocardiac opacification, likely atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
