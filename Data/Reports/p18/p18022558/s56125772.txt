                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, inability to walk, not taking lasix.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited due to patient rotation.  Heart size is likely mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient
 rotation.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild streaky left
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.
