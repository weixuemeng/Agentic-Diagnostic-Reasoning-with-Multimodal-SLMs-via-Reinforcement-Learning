                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, upper respiratory tract infection
 symptoms
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears borderline enlarged, accentuated by low lung
 volumes, but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 remarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal bibasilar patchy
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild patchy opacities in the lung bases, likely
 atelectasis.
