                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post thoracentesis, to assess interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 21:01 hours.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared to the prior study, there is aeration
 of the left upper lobe, with persistent opacity in the left lower hemithorax,
 which likely represents a combination of atelectasis and residual pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right lung is well expanded and
 clear.  Previously noted mild rightward shift of the mediastinum has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the left lung aeration.  Persistent left
 lower hemithorax opacity, likely represents residual atelectasis/pleural
 effusion.
