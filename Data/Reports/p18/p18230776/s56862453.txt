                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged with coronary arterial stents
 visualized.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates calcifications at the
 aortic knob.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities
 within the lingula likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
