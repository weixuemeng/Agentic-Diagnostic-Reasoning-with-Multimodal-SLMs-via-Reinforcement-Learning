                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and night sweats, had
 general anesthesia for shoulder surgery two weeks ago.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No typical
 configurational abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  On the right lung base and medially,
 a small area of pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are noted overlying the
 otherwise normal vascular pulmonary pattern.  On the lateral view, this small
 infiltrate is located to the lower portion of the posterior segment of the
 right lower lobe.  No other pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  When comparison
 is made with the previous chest examination of ___, the at that
 time completely normal appearance of the lung parenchyma confirms the present
 diagnosis of a small peribronchial infiltrate in the right lower lobe.  This
 matches the patient's clinical findings.  Followup examination after
 successful treatment is recommended.
