                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Squamous cell esophageal CA, now for immunotherapy, evaluate for
 pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 CHEST TWO VIEWS.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The right infrahilar clear space is obscured, but
 this is unchanged and likely an artifact due to mild right convex scoliosis.
 There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  No CHF, frank
 consolidation or effusion.  Faint opacity in the left lung laterally is noted,
 but likely represents artifact due to overlying bone and vascular shadows. A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath type catheter is present, tip over distal SVC, near
 SVC/RA junction.    
 
 Compared with ___, minimal atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle is
 new.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt acute pulmonary process.
