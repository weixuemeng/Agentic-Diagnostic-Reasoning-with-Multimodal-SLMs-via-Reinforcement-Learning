                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lethargy and history of esophageal carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the
 right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Opacification in the left lower lobe has
 increased since the prior examination, best appreciated on the lateral
 projection.  Findings likely reflect progression of post-radiation changes as
 described previously on recent chest CT, however, superimposed infection or
 aspiration is possible.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No vascular congestion or large pleural effusions are evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm has increased since the prior examination and may
 reflect worsening subdiaphragmatic metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible left lower lobe pneumonia or abscess.  Recommend oblique
 radiographs of the chest for further evaluation of the lung bases.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above findings and recommendations to
 ___ at 9:40 am on ___ by telephone.
