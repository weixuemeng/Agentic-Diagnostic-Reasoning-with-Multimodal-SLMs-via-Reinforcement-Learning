 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___, 16:23.  As noted on the previous examination,
 the endotracheal tube is relatively low and could be pulled back by 1-2 cm. 
 In addition, given the scoliosis of the patient, the tube is directed towards
 the tracheal wall and not towards the tracheal lumen.  This might be the
 reason for the issues with the suction tube.  Unchanged position of the right
 PICC line and of the feeding tube.  Stable appearance of the lung parenchyma
 and the heart.
