                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman needs doboff  // doboff tube insertion     
 doboff tube insertion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, on the final image the
 Dobhoff tube is in the distal stomach.  The tip of the endotracheal tube now
 measures only about 1.2 cm above the carina and it should be pulled back about
 2-3 cm.  Otherwise, again there are even lower lung volumes with retrocardiac
 opacification consistent with volume loss left lower lobe and pleural fluid.
