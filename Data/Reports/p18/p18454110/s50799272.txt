                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and pigtail catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was
 inserted into the right pleural space.  At the site of insertion, there is a
 basal pneumothorax of approximately 2-3 cm in diameter.  The pre-existing
 effusion has almost completely resolved.  At the base of the right lung, there
 are ill-defined opacities, which could be the result of re-expansion.  There
 currently is no evidence of tension.  The vascular stent in the vena cava is
 constant.  Constant moderate cardiomegaly and normal appearance of the left
 lung.
