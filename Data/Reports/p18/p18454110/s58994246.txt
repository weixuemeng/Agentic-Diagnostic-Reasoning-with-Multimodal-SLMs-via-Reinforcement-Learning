                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart remains enlarged, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, marked improvement in previously reported pulmonary edema.  Right
 lower lobe opacity has also improved, but a left retrocardiac opacity persists
 accompanied by adjacent pleural effusion.  On the right, circumferential
 right-sided pleural opacity is unchanged but a dependent pleural effusion has
 slightly decreased in size.
