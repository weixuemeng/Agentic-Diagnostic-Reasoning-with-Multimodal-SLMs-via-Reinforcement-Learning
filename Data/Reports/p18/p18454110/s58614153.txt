                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post chest tube removal.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to prior studies performed a day earlier.
 
 Large right hydropneumothorax is grossly unchanged allowing the difference in
 technique and positioning of the patient.  The exact evaluation of the air
 component is limited but the presence of air-fluid levels are consistent with
 the presence of hydropneumothorax.  Moderate left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly.  SVC stent is again noted.  A large central catheter coming from
 below has its tip in the right atrium.  This is unchanged from prior. 
 Vascular congestion has resolved.
