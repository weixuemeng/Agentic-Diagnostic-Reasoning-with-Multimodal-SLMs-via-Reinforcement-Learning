                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 expanded with perhaps mild increase in right pleural effusion which tracks to
 the apex and along the mediastinal pleural surface.  Small left pleural
 effusion appears unchanged.  Though no focal consolidation is seen, right
 basilar opacities are similar in appearance to that of ___ and could
 relate to atelectasis or fissural fluid.  Increase in interstitial abnormality
 likely reflect mild pulmonary edema.  The heart remains enlarged with a
 calcified aortic contour and superior vena cava stent noted.  Catheter
 projecting over the right aspect of the vertebral bodies is likely a dialysis
 catheter terminating in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in right pleural effusion with mild pulmonary edema and
 unchanged left pleural effusion.  
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities are most likely atelectasis or fissural pleural fluid.
 Infectious process or aspiration is not excluded.
