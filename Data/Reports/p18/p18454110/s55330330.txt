                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Moderate left
 and small right pleural effusions are probably similar when allowances are
 made for differences in positioning of the patient, and there remains a
 persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation adjacent to the
 effusion on the left.  Slight interval improved aeration at the right lung
 base with residual bronchial wall thickening and streaky peribronchiolar
 opacities remaining.
