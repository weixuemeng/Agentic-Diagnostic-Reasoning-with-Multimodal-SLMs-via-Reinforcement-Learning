 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough for two days, questionable aspiration event, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The technical quality of the radiograph is limited, with subsequent
 limited assessment of the lung parenchyma.  Moderate cardiomegaly, bilateral
 small pleural effusions with areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.  These
 changes are relatively constant as compared to the previous examination. 
 Stent appears to be implanted in the superior vena cava.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  Mild interstitial fluid overload could be present.  A
 tubular device projects over the paraspinal region at the level of the right
 upper quadrant and is only incompletely imaged on the lateral radiograph.
