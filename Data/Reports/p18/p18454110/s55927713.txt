 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 nasogastric tube.  Course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube
 projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  The sidehole is 3 cm below the
 gastroesophageal junction.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly, small
 bilateral pleural effusions and areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  Mild
 fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
