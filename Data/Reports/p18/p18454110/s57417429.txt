                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right pleural effusion and pneumothorax,
 requiring assessment for interval change in the pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from multiple
 ___ on ___ and from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate slight interval
 improvement in the right basilar pneumothorax since previous imaging.  The
 rest of the chest radiograph is essentially unchanged from prior imaging.  The
 right basilar opacity is unchanged.   The left-sided pleural effusion has not
 changed since prior imaging.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Again seen is the SVC stent, femoral central line
 with tip in the right atrium, and pigtail catheter at the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in right basilar pneumothorax since prior
 imaging.  Otherwise, essentially unchanged chest radiograph.
