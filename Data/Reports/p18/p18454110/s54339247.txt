                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe crackles, low-grade temperature.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Extensive mitral annular
 calcifications are noted.   SVC stent appears to be in unchanged position, and
 a dual lumen catheter coursing within the inferior vena cava appears to
 terminate in the right atrium.  The aorta remains diffusely calcified and
 tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema which has increased compared to the
 previous exam.  Small to moderate left pleural effusion appears relatively
 unchanged.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis,
 more pronounced on the left.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse compared to the previous chest
 radiograph, with small to moderate left pleural effusion and bibasilar
 atelectasis, more pronounced on the left.
