                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with acute hypoxia and history of chronic
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right approach PICC terminates in the upper
 SVC, unchanged.  Nasoenteric catheter courses below the diaphragm and is at
 least within the stomach.  Overall aeration of the left lung base has improved
 in the interval, though basilar atelectasis and small bilateral effusions
 persist.  A vena cava filter is in unchanged position.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A probable biliary stent is partially imaged in the right upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Slightly improved aeration of the left lower lobe, otherwise no significant
 change from recent prior.
