                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right pleural effusion and pneumothorax
 requiring interval assessment of change in the pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from multiple
 ___ earlier the same day, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate significant interval
 improvement in the right basilar pneumothorax.  The left pleural effusion has
 increased in size since prior imaging.  There is no change in the right
 basilar opacities.  Cardiomegaly is mild and stable.  A stent is seen which is
 likely in the SVC.  There is a large femoral central line with the tip in the
 right atrium.  A pigtail catheter is again seen in the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significantly improved right basilar pneumothorax.  Otherwise,
 essentially unchanged chest radiograph.
