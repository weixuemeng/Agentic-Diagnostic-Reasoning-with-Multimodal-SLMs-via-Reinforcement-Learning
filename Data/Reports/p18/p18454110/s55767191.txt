                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest, mild pulmonary edema has resolved from all but the left
 lung base since ___, no moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly persists, and
 moderate left pleural effusion has increased.  Nodular right pleural
 thickening is presumably the residua of previous chronic pleural effusions. 
 Dual-channel catheter set which previously ended in the right atrium and at
 the level of the inferior cavoatrial junction has pulled back to the level of
 the intra- or infrahepatic inferior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Caval stent is unchanged in position at the level of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
