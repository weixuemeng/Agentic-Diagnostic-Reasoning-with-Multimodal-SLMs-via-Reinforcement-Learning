                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable, and the pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Known left lower lobe mass is redemonstrated, with a small associated left
 pleural effusion, as seen on the recent CT.  Fullness of the right hilum
 likely reflects known lymphadenopathy, and the right lung otherwise is clear
 without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.  There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe mass as demonstrated on the prior CT, with small
 left pleural effusion.  Right hilar fullness compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  No new focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
