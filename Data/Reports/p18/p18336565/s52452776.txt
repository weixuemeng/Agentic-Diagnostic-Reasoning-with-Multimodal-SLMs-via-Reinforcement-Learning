                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with SBO vs ileus s/p NG tube placement. On TPN.  // eval NG
 tube, tunneled line position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacity in the left midlung is compatible with scarring versus
 atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged in
 position.  Enteric tube tip is best seen on the lateral view at the region of
 the GE junction or slightly below.  Multiple air-fluid levels seen in the
 upper abdomen.  No free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube tip just distal to the GE junction should be advanced for optimal
 positioning.
