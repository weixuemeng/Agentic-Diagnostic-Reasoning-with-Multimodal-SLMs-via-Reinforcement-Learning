                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with complicated GI history including Crohn's s/p colectomy,
 multiple laparotomies, short gut syndrome with G-tube, who presented with
 worsening vomiting, diarrhea, and abd pain, now with new onset fever and
 leukocytosis.  // Evidence of new consolidations?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a right-sided PICC line with
 tip in the distal SVC.  There is volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower
 lobe that is new compared to prior again seen and more conspicuous than on the
 prior study are multiple mildly dilated loops of bowel.  The patient had a
 contrast-enhanced CT 1 day ago and therefore there is contrast outlining many
 of these loops of bowel.  However with unusual is that in many areas it
 appears that both the inside and outside of the bowel wall is visualized. 
 There is no other evidence of free air and therefore this is likely an
 artifact of the manner in which the contrast has been distributed
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Volume loss/ infiltrate in the left lower lobe mildly dilated loops of small
 bowel with unusual appearance to the bowel wall.  A followup upright film to
 exclude free air would be helpful
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone
 at ___ at the time of discovery
