                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset ankle swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This slightly limits assessment of the lung bases.  The
 heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
