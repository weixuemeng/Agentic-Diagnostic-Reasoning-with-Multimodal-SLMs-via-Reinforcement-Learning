                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, myalgias  // evaluate for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lower lung opacities on
 the frontal projection in the setting of markedly low lung volumes most likely
 represents bronchovascular crowding. No convincing sign of pneumonia, effusion
 or pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears
 grossly unremarkable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding likely
 accounting for the lower lung opacity seen on the frontal projection only.
 Consider dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest with more optimal
 inspiratory effort to better assessed.
