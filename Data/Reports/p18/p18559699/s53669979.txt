                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, rapid atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, increased compared to the prior exam, but
 partially accentuated due to slightly low lung volumes.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  The mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 noted.  Lung volumes are slightly low with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Decrease in lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Heart size is increased compared to the prior study, but no overt pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated.
