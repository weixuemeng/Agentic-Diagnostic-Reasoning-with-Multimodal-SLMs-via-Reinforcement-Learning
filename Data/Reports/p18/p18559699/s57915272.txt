                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachybrady status post dual-chamber pacemaker.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared with ___, a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker has been placed, with
 lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Again seen is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly,
 with a tortuous aorta.  Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Lateral
 views suggest minimal retrosternal air, likely related to the recent
 procedure.
