                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated ___. ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  On the lateral view only there is
 a small, vague opacity within the lung posterior base, which may represent
 overlap of vascular structures, but consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the lateral view only there is a small, vague opacity within the posterior
 base, which may represent overlap of vascular structures, but consolidation
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
