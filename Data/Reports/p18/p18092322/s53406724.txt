                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 previously seen right-sided PICC is no longer seen.  Opacity at the left
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view may be due to overlying soft tissue;
 however, there also appears to be increased opacity along the posterior,
 inferior chest on the lateral view.  An underlying consolidation is not
 excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Suboptimal due to patient's body habitus.
 2.  Posterior, inferior opacity not well substantiated on the lateral view,
 but regardless, raises concern for consolidation, possibly due to infection.
 This was not substantiated upon review of subsequent chest CT and the opacity
 may relate to overlying soft tissue.
