                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain, recent endoscopy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax. The lungs are adequately expanded without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening or mild
 interstitial disease.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Surgical
 clips are noted in the upper abdomen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Bronchial wall thickening or mild interstitial disease, raising the query
 of chronic asthma despite absence of hyperinflation. Comparison with prior
 imaging would be helpful for further characterization.
