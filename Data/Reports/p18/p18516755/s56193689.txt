                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities in the lung bases,
 left greater than right, likely reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 confluent opacity is identified to suggest aspiration or pneumonia.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  No vascular congestion, pulmonary
 edema, or pleural effusions are identified.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear opacities likely reflecting areas of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No pleural effusions.
