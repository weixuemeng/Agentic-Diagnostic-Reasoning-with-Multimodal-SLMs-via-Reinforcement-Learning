                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  No tracheostomy tube is seen.  Dextroscoliosis of the mid thoracic
 spine slightly limits evaluation of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or edema.  A left PICC is unchanged with the tip
 terminating in the low SVC.  The lungs are slightly hyperinflated with
 persistent but improved severe left lower lobe atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved but persistent severe left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
