                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is mild increase in the
 bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more prominent on the left.  Some
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Central catheter again extends to the lower SVC.
