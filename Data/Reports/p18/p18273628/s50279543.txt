                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion. Review of OMR indicates history diffuse large
 B-cell lymphoma. 
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 On today's exam, there are small bilateral effusions. The right effusion is
 equivocally slightly smaller and there is only a tiny residual left effusion. 
 There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis as well as some lingular atelectasis. 
 The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  No CHF.  Clips just above the right thoracic inlet again
 noted.  
 
 An 8mm rounded sclerotic density in the right proximal humerus is seen at the
 extreme edge of the image. However, there is no corresponding abnormality on
 the ___ chest CT (7:34), and I therefor suspect this represents an
 artifact. Moreover, no abnormality was seen on this area on the ___ PET
 scan.  If clinically indicated, right shoulder radiographs could help for
 further assessment.
