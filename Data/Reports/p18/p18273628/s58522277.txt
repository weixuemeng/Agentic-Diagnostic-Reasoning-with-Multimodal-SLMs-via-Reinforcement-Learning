 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:13 PM
  Comparison is made to radiograph dated 1 day prior. Portable AP upright
  radiograph demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions, which
  appear stable in extent when compared to prior study. Streaky opacity within
  the right lower lung zone appears minimally more conspicuous which may reflect
  atelectasis or alternatively developing pneumonia. A right PICC is seen
  terminating in unchanged position at the cavoatrial junction.
  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis and pleural
 effusions, which appear stable in extent when compared to prior study. Streaky
 opacity within the right lower lung zone appears minimally more conspicuous
 which may reflect atelectasis or alternatively developing pneumonia. A right
