                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New fevers, right-sided crackles, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy
 opacity in the left lower zone, which could represent an early infiltrate. 
 Minimal patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic angle is also seen, may reflect
 chronic scarring.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  No
 effusion.  The heart is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Hazy opacity at the left base could represent an early infiltrate.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 3.  Minimal patchy opacity at right cardiophrenic angle, ?scarring.
