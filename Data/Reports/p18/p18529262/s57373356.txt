                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cervical neck fracture now with crackles at
 bases  // r/o pna/ pulm edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 colonic interposition. Aside from the left lower lobe subsegmental
 atelectasis, the lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart
 and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable.  A chronic left distal clavicular
 fracture and AC joint dislocation is incidentally noted. Irregularly shaped
 opacities at the left AC joint may be due to heterotopic ossification.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Assessment limited by low lung volumes.
 Left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis with no evidence of pneumonia.
