                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Sepsis.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Mild
 subpleural scarring is unchanged at each lung apex.  Although there is no
 pleural effusion on the right, there is a new small pleural effusion on the
 left since four days earlier.  Patchy associated opacity in the retrocardiac
 area is streaky, possibly atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New small pleural effusion.  Possibly increasing opacification of
 the left lung base reflects early developing infection but does not represent
 a definite infectious source since atelectasis and pleural effusion could
 yield a similar appearance.
