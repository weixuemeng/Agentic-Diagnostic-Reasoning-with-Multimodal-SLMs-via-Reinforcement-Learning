                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous with diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Worsening ill-defined patchy opacities are noted within both lung apices,
 right worse than left, as well as within the right lung base.  Findings are
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  Aeration within the left lung base is
 improved, with residual patchy opacity suggestive of atelectasis.  Small left
 pleural effusion persists.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple clips are
 again seen at the gastroesophageal junction.  Diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening patchy ill-defined opacities within the lung apices and the right
 lung base concerning for infection.  Streaky opacity in the left lung base
 appears improved compared to the prior study, and could reflect an area of
 atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion persists.
