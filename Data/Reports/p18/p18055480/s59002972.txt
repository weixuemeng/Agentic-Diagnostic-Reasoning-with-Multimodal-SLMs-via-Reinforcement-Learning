                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post motor vehicle collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation is made to subsequent CT scan performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine view of the chest.  There is increased hazy opacity projecting
 over the right lung compatible with layering effusion and atelectasis. 
 Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better seen on subsequent CT.  The left
 lung is grossly clear but partially obscured by overlying trauma board and
 hardware.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided rib fractures better seen on subsequent CT as well as layering
 effusion and atelectasis.
