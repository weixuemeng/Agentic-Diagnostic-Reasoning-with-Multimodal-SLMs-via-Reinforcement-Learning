                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of metastatic breast cancer, on
 chemotherapy, now with fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and CT of
 the chest performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a right-sided
 Port-A-Cath with the tip unchanged in position terminating in the upper SVC. 
 A left-sided shunt catheter is seen coursing superior to inferior and out of
 view on these images.  Diffuse coarse reticular opacities have been present
 intermittently over the past year and a half and now present predominantly in
 the left lung base, similar in appearance to ___ and new from the
 preceding radiograph of ___.  This may represent recurrent infection,
 particularly in the clinical setting of fever or less likely disseminated
 lymphangitic metastasis responsive to chemotherapy or localized edema due to
 pulmonary venous thrombosis.  A small left pleural effusion with fluid
 extending into the oblique fissure is new from ___.  No pneumothorax,
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema is present.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Recurrent coarse reticular opacities in the left lower lung, similar to
 ___ and new from ___ represent recurrent infection in the
 clinical setting of fevers.  Alternatively, disseminated lymphangitic
 metastasis responsive to chemotherapy or localized edema due to pulmonary
 venous thrombosis.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion new from ___.
