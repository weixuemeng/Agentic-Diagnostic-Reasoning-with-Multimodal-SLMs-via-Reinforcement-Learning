 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:40 PM
  New opacity at the left base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is
  accounted in part by a small to moderate left pleural effusion, but underlying
  consolidation is not excluded. Increased opacity at the right lung base is
  concernig for an infectious process. Dobhoff is postpyloric.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cirrhosis and reassessment of pulmonary edema.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  The
 heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable.  There is new left lower lobe
 consolidation with adjacent pleural effusions that might potentially reflect
 infectious process.  Small amount of right pleural fluid is noted.  There is
 mild vascular engorgement but no overt pulmonary edema demonstrated.
