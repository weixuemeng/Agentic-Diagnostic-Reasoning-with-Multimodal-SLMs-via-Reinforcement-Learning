                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough, chills for 3 days
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal contour is normal.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Focal consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia. The left lung is clear. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle on
 the lateral view posteriorly suggests a trace pleural effusion. No left-sided
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Mild multilevel degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia and trace right pleural effusion. Followup
 radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of this
 finding.
