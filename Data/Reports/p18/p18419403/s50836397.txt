                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF PNA IPF  // eval for intrapulm process
 
 COMPARISON:  NONE AVAILABLE
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carinal and a nasogastric tube is
 coiled in the proximal stomach with tip directed cephalad in the fundus.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured on the left but
 likely mildly enlarged. Widening of mediastinal and hilar contours could
 reflect vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.  Asymmetrically
 distributed bilateral airspace opacities involve the left lung more than the
 right. In the right lung, consolidation is most prominent in the right upper
 lung above the minor fissure. These findings are superimposed upon a bilateral
 interstitial pattern.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetrically distributed multifocal consolidation may reflect multifocal
 pneumonia with or without a component of pulmonary edema in this patient with
 history of underlying IPF. Mediastinal and hilar widening may reflect engorged
 vessels and or lymphadenopathy.  Direct comparison to outside studies would be
 helpful as well as short-term followup radiographs peer
