 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Within the
 lungs, minimal linear opacities are present within the lingula and left lower
 lobe, but there are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusions or acute skeletal abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
