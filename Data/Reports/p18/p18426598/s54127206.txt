                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dobbhoff placement assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest demonstrate the Dobbhoff being coiled in the
 stomach, terminating in the distal esophagus.  No assessment of the chest can
 be done since the study focuses on the lung bases and upper abdomen.
