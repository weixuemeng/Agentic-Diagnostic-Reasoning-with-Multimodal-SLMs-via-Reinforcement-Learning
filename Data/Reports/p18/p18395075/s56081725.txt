                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with former smoker with chronic cough // r/o
 infiltrate, mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large, indistinctly marginated  opacity in and/or originating from
 the right upper lobe obscuring the upper and lateral borders of the right
 hilus. Rightward mediastinal shift and diaphragmatic elevation reflect right
 lung, predominantly upper lobe volume loss. Probable adenopathy enlarges the
 lower pole of the right hilus, and subcarinal adenopathy indents the underside
 of the right mainstem bronchus and protrudes posteriorly on the lateral view.
 These findings are most consistent with a central mass in the right upper lobe
 of right lung compromising the bronchus, accompanied by extensive central
 adenopathy,  likely primary bronchogenic carcinoma, less commonly lymphoma.
 Pneumonia and reactive lymphadenopathy could also explain these findings,
 although less likely.
 Left lung, left pleural space, hilus and the left mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable right upper lobe mass with postobstructive atelectasis and hilar and
 subcarinal adenopathy, primary bronchogenic carcinoma vs less likely lymphoma.
 Chest CT with contrast is recommended to stage and plan approach to diagnosis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with intravenous contrast.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 12:10 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
