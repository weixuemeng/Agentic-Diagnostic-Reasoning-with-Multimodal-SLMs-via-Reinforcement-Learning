                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___,
 PET CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacification in the right hilar region and right upper lobe corresponds to
 known of malignancy, better assessed on the previous PET-CT with associated
 postobstructive changes.  In the interval, there is new development of a
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the
 presence of the right-sided pleural effusion.  Abnormal widened mediastinal
 contour is unchanged and compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy.  Left
 lung is clear without pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of moderate size right pleural effusion.  Right upper
 lobe and hilar opacification compatible with known malignancy with
 postobstructive changes.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, better assessed on
 recent PET-CT.
