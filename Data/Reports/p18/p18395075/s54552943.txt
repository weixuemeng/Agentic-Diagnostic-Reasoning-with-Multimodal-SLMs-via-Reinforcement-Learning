                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SVC encasement here with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Right paratracheal mass appears unchanged
 from the previous chest CT allowing for differences in modality.  Prominence
 of the right hilum is unchanged and due to adenopathy, better assessed on
 prior CT.  There is continued volume loss in the right lung with elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Known right upper lobe spiculated lesion is re-
 demonstrated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No gross interval change in right paratracheal mass, right hilar
 lymphadenopathy, and right upper lobe spiculated lesion, all better seen on
 the recent CT.  No new focal consolidation.
