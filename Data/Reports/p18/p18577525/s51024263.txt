                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of right lower lung mass, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
 improvement of the extensive parenchymal opacity on the right, notably the
 level of the right lower lobe.  Otherwise, no relevant change is seen.  A
 slight increase in lung density on the left is caused by positional factors. 
 Endotracheal tube, left PICC line and nasogastric tube are in unchanged
 position.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
