                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left chest wall pain status post fall, assess pneumonia or
 rib fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating clear
 well expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal aside from an unfolded thoracic
 aorta.  Bony structures appear intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.  If there is strong clinical
 concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series is advised.
