 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours Conal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal
 patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects an area of atelectasis.

 osseous abnormalities seen.  H-shaped vertebra is compatible with a history of
 sickle cell disease.
