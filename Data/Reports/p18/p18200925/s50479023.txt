                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man who presented to PCP's office with dyspnea and
 hypoxia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Patient has a large chronic hiatus hernia. Lateral view shows at least three
 retained pills in the hiatus hernia. Increased linear opacification at the
 left lung base is not sufficiently confluent to consider pneumonia, but may
 reflect recent aspiration.  A similar-appearing region in the right mid lung
 may have the same explanation.  Heart is top normal size, exaggerated by the
 hiatus hernia.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Large calcified nodule in the left thyroid lobe is chronic.  
 Patient has an umbrella filter in the inferior vena cava.
