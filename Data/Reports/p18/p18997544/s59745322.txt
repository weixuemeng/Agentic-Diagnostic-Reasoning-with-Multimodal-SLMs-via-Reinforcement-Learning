                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left rib pain. Evaluate for pneumonia or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___,
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes with
 bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Even
 allowing for this, the heart is probably top normal in size or mildly
 enlarged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 No rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette. No focal consolidation.
 2. Heart size top-normal to mildly enlarged.
 3. No acute rib fracture identified.  However, if there is continued clinical
 concern, a dedicated rib series could be performed.
