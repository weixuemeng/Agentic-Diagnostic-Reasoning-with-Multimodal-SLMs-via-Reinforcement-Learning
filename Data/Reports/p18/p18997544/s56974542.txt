 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:06 AM
  Focal opacity at the posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral view, not
  clearly localized on the frontal view. This could be infection in the proper
  clinical setting in which case repeat after treatment is suggested. In the
  absence of supportive symptoms however a CT scan should be performed - non
  necessarily in the acute setting. No visualized acute fracture however if
  desired, dedicated rib series could be performed.
