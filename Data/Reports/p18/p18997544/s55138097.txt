                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough/congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Previously noted
 rounded opacity in the left upper lobe has resolved.  Patchy opacities are
 noted in the both lower lobes, which may reflect atelectasis, however
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy lower lobe opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
