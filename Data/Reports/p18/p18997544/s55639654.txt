                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent diagnosis of pneumonia, now
 presenting with worsening cough and right chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior exam, which may in part be
 related to respiratory effort or phase of respiration.  Left lower lobe,
 ill-defined opacity with slight indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm on
 only the frontal view and ill-defined corresponding hypodensities in the
 posterior inferior long on the lateral view could represent atelectasis and/or
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation, more pronounced from the
 prior exam, albeit on the opposite side of the patient's current symptoms.  No
 focal consolidation is identified in the right lung.  No pleural effusions,
 pneumothorax, or edema.  The heart is probably normal in size given the lower
 lung volumes.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 Bilateral moderate degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joints are
 again seen.  No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Lower lung volumes.
 2.  Probable left lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical situation cannot be excluded.  However, of note, these
 radiographic findings are on the side opposite at the patient's symptoms.  No
 definite right lung consolidation.
 3.  No specific finding to explain the patient's right-sided symptoms.
