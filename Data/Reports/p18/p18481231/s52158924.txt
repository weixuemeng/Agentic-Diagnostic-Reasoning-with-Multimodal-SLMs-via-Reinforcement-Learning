  Low-lying endotracheal tube, ending 1.2 cm above the level of the carina;
  recommend withdrawing by 2 cm.  Enteric catheter is seen only to the level of
  the diaphragm, not visualized along its more distal course.  Two mediastinal
  drains are noted.  A right Swan-Ganz catheter is appropriately positioned. 
  Lung volumes are low, with right mid lung platelike atelectasis and left mid
  to lower lung subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No definite pleural
  effusions.  Pertinent findings were discussed with physicians assistant,
  ___, by Dr. ___ at 19:14 via telephone on the day of the
  study, immediately after discovery of the findings.

 HISTORY:  Post-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been a cardiac surgical
 procedure performed with intact midline sternal wires.  The endotracheal tube
 lies approximately 1.7 cm above the carina and could well be pulled back about
 2 cm.  The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right pulmonary artery. 
 Nasogastric tube extends at least to the level of the diaphragm where it
 crosses the lower margin of the image.  Mediastinal drains are in place.
 
 Continued low lung volumes with dense streak of atelectasis in the right mid
 zone as well as evidence of volume loss at the left base.  There is a patchy
 area of increased opacification in the right upper zone, which could represent
 a focus of aspiration.
