                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is markedly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Enlargement of the hila bilaterally could suggest underlying lymphadenopathy. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 There appear to be small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy
 opacities, potentially atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially atelectasis, but infection
 or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 4. Enlargement of the hila bilaterally, potentially suggestive of underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  Comparison with previous radiographs or cross-sectional
 imaging is recommended, otherwise, further assessment with CT is recommended.
