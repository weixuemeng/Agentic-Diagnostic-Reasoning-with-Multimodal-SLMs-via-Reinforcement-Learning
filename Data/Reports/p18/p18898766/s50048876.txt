                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube.  Evaluation for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The upper part of the nasogastric tube is coiled in the pharynx and
 must be re-positioned.  The further course is unremarkable, the tip projects
 over the gastroesophageal junction.  On the later radiograph from the same day
 (1:30 a.m.), the tube is in correct position.
