                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single supine AP radiograph demonstrates diffuse bilateral opacification, most
 likely edema. Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles suggests pleural
 effusions. Patient is status post intubation with an endotracheal tube seen
 terminating 3 cm from the level of the carinal in appropriate position. Two
 enteric tubes are seen descending along the expected course of the esophagus.
 No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Heart size is top-normal. Patient is
 rotated making evaluation of hilar and mediastinal contours difficult, though
 these appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacification thought probable pulmonary edema with small
 pleural effusions. ET tube in appropriate position.
