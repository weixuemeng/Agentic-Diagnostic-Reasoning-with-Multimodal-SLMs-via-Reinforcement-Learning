 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, and
 left-sided pacemaker device placement with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous
 and diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. 
 Linear opacities in the lower lobes are compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint and throughout
 the thoracic spine are again observed.

 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the lung
 bases.
