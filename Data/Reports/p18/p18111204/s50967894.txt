                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Prolonged cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  As before, there is status post sternotomy and
 the presence of multiple surgical clips and ring-shaped graft markers in the
 ascending aorta are consistent with previous bypass surgery.  In addition, the
 metallic components of a porcine aortic valve prosthesis is identified in that
 location.  The patient was recipient of a permanent pacer in left interior
 axillary position, connected to two intracavitary electrodes terminating in
 right atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly. 
 There is a third lead also terminating in the right ventricle and probably
 abandoned as it is not conclusively connected to the pacer itself.  Thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated and shows some calcium deposits in
 the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.
 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  One observes, however, relatively
 low positioned and somewhat flattened diaphragms, a finding which in
 conjunction with the somewhat irregular peripheral pulmonary vascular
 distribution suggests some degree of COPD.  Comparison with the next preceding
 study ___ ___, indicate some small poorly delineated new densities on
 the right base, similar changes surrounding the left apical area of the heart
 and most likely representing some intercurrent small infiltrates.  Large
 discrete pneumonic infiltrates are not seen and there is no pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:Stable chest findings in patient with criteria for COPD and
 probably temporary exacerbation which matches clinical findings.  A followup
 examination in two to three weeks after successful treatment is recommended.
