  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 4:24 PM
  Moderate cardiomegaly without central vascular engorgement or overt pulmonary
  edema, which could reflect cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Recommend
  correlation with physical exam findings.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 11:23 PM
  Moderate cardiomegaly with predominantly left ventricular enlargement without
  central vascular engorgement or overt pulmonary edema, which could reflect
  cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Recommend correlation with physical
  exam findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with episode of diaphoresis, unsteady gait  // eval for CM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None provided.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings
 as well as accentuation of the cardiac silhouette.  No definite consolidation,
 effusion, or edema.  S-shaped thoracic scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
