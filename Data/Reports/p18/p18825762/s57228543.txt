                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preop evaluation for right hip fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Linear opacity within the left lower lobe is compatible with
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Mild loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body is noted anteriorly, but age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild anterior wedge deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body,
 age indeterminate.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
