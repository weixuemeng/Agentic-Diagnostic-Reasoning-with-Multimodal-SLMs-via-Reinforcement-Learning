                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with crackles in chest  // eval for pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles suggests trace
 pleural effusions.  There is a large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Compression of at least 2 lower thoracic vertebral bodies is seen, of
 indeterminate age given lack of priors for comparison.  No pneumothorax is
 seen
