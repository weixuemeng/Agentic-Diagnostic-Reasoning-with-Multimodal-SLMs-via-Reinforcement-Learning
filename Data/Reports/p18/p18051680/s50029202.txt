                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with likely CHF presenting with sinus pauses
 concerning for high grade AV block now s/p temporary pacemaker  // interval
 assessment of temporary pacer wire     interval assessment of temporary pacer
 wire
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  The pacer wire from the low extends to the level of the apex of
 the right ventricle.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, quant her lying chronic pulmonary disease, or both.
 The area of increased opacification at the right base is much less prominent,
 suggesting that this reflected the low lung volumes and some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure rather than a true consolidation.
 The hemidiaphragms are much better seen.  This could reflect improved pleural
 effusion and basilar atelectasis, though it also could be a manifestation of a
 more erect position of the patient.
