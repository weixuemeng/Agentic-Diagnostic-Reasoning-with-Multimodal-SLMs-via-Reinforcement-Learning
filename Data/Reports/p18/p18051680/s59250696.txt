                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with confusion, ___, new complete heart block
 noted to have potential aspiration events.  // evaluate for any infiltrates,
 PNA, edema     evaluate for any infiltrates, PNA, edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion.  An area of more
 focal opacification is seen at the right base that obscures the right heart
 border and medial aspect of the hemidiaphragm.  Although some of this could
 reflect crowding of engorged pulmonary vessels, the possibility of
 superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragms also suggests the presence of layering
 pleural effusions.
