                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new O2 requirement and crackles on exam,
 evaluate for pulmonary edema or vascular congestion to suggest intravascular
 volume overload  // ___ year old man with new O2 requirement and crackles on
 exam, evaluate for pulmonary edema or vascular congestion to suggest
 intravascular volume overload    ___ year old man with new O2 requirement and
 crackles on exam
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, making it difficult to distinguish bibasilar
 opacification due to atelectasis from pneumonia or aspiration.  I would
 recommend followup with conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs, when
 feasible.  The upper lungs are clear.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Heart is
 normal size and there is no pleural abnormality.
