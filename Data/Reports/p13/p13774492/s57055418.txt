                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with resp distress, pls eval for edema, pna or
 effusion  // History: ___F with resp distress, pls eval for edema, pna or
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are reasonably well expanded.  Left retrocardiac streak the airspace
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  The bilateral costophrenic angles are
 slightly blunted, which may be secondary to small effusion, atelectasis,
 scarring, or patient body habitus.  A rounded nodular opacity overlies the
 right upper lung and distal clavicle, and is incompletely localized on this
 single image.  There is no large pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Incompletely localized rounded opacity projecting over the right upper
 lung.  Recommend  chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ on ___.
