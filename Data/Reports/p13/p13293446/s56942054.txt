                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON: Previous exams dating back to ___, with most recent
 from ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are relatively low
 lung volumes.  There is more dense consolidation in the right middle lobe. 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, small-to-moderate on the right and
 small on the left.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Again seen is density
 projecting over the anterior right first rib, likely at the costochondral
 junction given persistence of the finding in this region on multiple priors. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires and
 mediastinal clips are again noted.  Hypertrophic changes are noted in the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral effusions, larger on the right than on the left.  Right
 middle lobe opacity compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. 
 Alternatively, this could be due to atelectasis given low lung volumes. 
 Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
