                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and altered mental status.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___,
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There has been interval development of a dense,
 retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the descending aorta, concerning for
 left lower lobe consolidation.  Redemonstrated is a persistent opacity within
 the right middle lobe, unchanged since ___, which may represent a
 focus of infection versus focal atelectasis.  Small, bilateral pleural
 effusions are noted again.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart appears
 mildly enlarged, although this may be exaggerated by the AP projection and
 retrocardiac airspace disease.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact and well
 aligned.  No acute bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development of a retrocardiac airspace opacity, concerning for
 new left lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend further evaluation with true PA and
 lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 2.  Unchanged right middle lobe airspace opacity, unchanged since ___.  Findings may be compatible with persistent pneumonia versus focal
 atelectasis.  
 
 Followup after treatment is suggested to confirm resolution.
