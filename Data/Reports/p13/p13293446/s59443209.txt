  No evidence of acute disease.  Mild fullness of soft tissue in aortopulmonary
  window, probably artifact; however suggest PA and lateral views in short-term
  follow-up when possible to reassess.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis, presenting with leukocytosis and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is soft tissue fullness in the
 aortopulmonary window, suspected to be post-operative or due to a confluence
 of shadows.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Small-to-moderate anterior flowing osteophytes are noted along the
 mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Soft tissue fullness in the aortopulmonary window, probably artifactual or
 post-operative.  However, when clinically appropriate, standard PA and lateral
 radiographs are recommended with optimal inspiration in order to reassess when
 possible clinically.  Correlation with prior radiographs, if available, could
 also be helpful.
