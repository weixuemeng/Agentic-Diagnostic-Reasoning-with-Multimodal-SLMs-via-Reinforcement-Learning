 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, assessment for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  Today's radiograph shows evidence of mild bilateral pleural
 effusion, moderate cardiomegaly and areas of relatively substantial bilateral
 basal atelectasis.  In the interval, the right internal jugular vein catheter
 has been removed.  The sternal wires show unchanged alignment.
