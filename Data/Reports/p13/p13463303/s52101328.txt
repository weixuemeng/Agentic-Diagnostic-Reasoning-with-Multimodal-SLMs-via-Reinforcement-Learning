 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with mild, persistent cough. Remote h/o smoking
 // ?etiology of cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The aorta is tortuous, heavily calcified, and generally large. Comparison with
 prior studies, which are not available at the time of this interpretation,
 would be helpful in evaluating this abnormality. If this is a new finding or
 there are no outside studies available, cross-sectional imaging is
 recommended. Numerous surgical clips are noted in the thyroid bed. There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tortuous and heavily calcified aorta, for which comparison with prior
 studies is recommended.
 2. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
