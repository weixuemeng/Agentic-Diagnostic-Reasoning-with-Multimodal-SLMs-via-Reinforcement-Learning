                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis of likely urinary source, new
 tachypnea  // Assess for pulmonary edema or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, particular in the left lung were there is elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm and a left basal opacity, likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Surgical clips consistent
 with a prior thyroidectomy.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. 
 Moderately severe degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity likely reflects atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot
 be excluded.
