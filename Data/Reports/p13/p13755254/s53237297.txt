                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough.  Rule out an acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild enlargement of both pulmonary hila has been present to some extent,
 continuously on the left and at least previously in ___ on the right.  If
 this is adenopathy rather than just redundant vasculature, it does not appear
 to be progressive, and there is no evidence of adenopathy elsewhere in the
 mediastinum such as the paratracheal stations or aortopulmonic window.  The
 lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.  On the lateral view, one
 can see relatively heavy calcification of the mitral annulus, a finding which
 is sometimes associated with mitral regurgitation, but there are no other
 radiographic findings to support that.  Overall, there is no radiographic
 explanation for the patient's cough.
