                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The costophrenic angles are not fully included on the lateral view.
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are low lung
 volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.  Degenerative changes
 are seen in the acromioclavicular joint.  Degenerative changes are seen along
 the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
