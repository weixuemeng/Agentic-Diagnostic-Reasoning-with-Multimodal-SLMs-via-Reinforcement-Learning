                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Blood-tinged vomit 
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest.  
 
 Only seen on the lateral view at the costophrenic angle is a spiculated
 nodular density measuring approximately 11 mm.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  The
 heart size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 11 mm spiculated nodular density is noted in the costophrenic angle which may
 simply represent overlying shadows.  Recommend the repeat lateral radiograph
 in order to assess if this persists.  
 
 By the time of review of the study, the patient had left the ED therefore
 these results were emailed to the Emergency Department QA nurses.
