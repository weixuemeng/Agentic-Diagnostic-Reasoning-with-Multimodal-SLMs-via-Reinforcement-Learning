 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly low lung volumes

 crowding.  Allowing for this, heart size is top-normal to mildly enlarged in
 size.  There is mild vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  A mildly elevated left hemidiaphragm is similar appearance
 compared to multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation
