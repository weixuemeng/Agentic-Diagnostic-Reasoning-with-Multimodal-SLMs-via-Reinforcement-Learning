                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypercalcemia  // assess for evidence of
 sarcoid
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased size of the right hilum consistent with lymphadenopathy.
 There is a faint, ill-defined opacity overlying the right second rib to which
 attention should be paid on followup imaging. There is no, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased size the right hilum consistent with lymphadenopathy.
 2. Faint ill-defined opacity overlying the right second rib to which attention
 should be paid on followup imaging, could represent peribronchial nodules in
 the setting of question sarcoid.  If further evaluation of the lung parenchyma
 is clinically warranted, CT can be performed.
