 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post laparoscopy, fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. 
 The nasogastric tube has been slightly advanced and the tip now projects over
 the mid parts of the stomach.
 
 The existing parenchymal opacities are overall unchanged in extent, but appear
 more concentrated around the perihilar areas.
 
 Minimal pleural effusions and bilateral apical thickening persists.  No new
 parenchymal changes.
