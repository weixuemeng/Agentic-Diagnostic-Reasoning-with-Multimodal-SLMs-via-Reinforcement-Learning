                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Preop chest radiograph for patient with SBO crackles on lung exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, terminating in the left
 upper quadrant.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is persistent
 relative opacity over the lateral right mid to lower lung which may relate to
 chronic lung disease/scarring, but an early infectious process is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
 Mediastinal contours are stable.
