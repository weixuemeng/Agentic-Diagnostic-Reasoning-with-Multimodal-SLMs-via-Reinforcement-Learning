                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Five days of a productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Linear opacities at the bilateral bases are unchanged from the
 prior exam, and most consistent with scarring.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 without a focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and unchanged from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, no evidence of
 pneumonia.
