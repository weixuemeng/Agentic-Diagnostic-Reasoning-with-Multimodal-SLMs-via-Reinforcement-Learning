                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, prerenal transplant, assess for
 cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  A well circumscribed 2.3 x 1.5
 cm oval opacity projects between the right sixth and seventh posterior ribs on
 frontal view and in the posterior soft tissues at the level of the middle to
 lower third of the scapula on the lateral view.  Right upper lateral and
 apical pleural surfaces are thickened with mild tracheal deviation to the
 right, signifying scarring in the right upper lobe.  The heart size is normal.
 There is mild thickening of the left major fissure.  There is no evidence of
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable subcutaneous calcification or very dense soft tissue nodule,
 right back.  Suggest shallow oblique views with soft tissue marker to confirm.
 
 2.  Pleural thickening in the right apex.
