                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post wedge resection left lower lobe, chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, the left-sided chest tube has been removed. Otherwise,
 I doubt significant interval change.  No definite pneumothorax is identified. 
 No gross effusion.   Lateral view demonstrates small posterior effusion,
 probably bilateral.
