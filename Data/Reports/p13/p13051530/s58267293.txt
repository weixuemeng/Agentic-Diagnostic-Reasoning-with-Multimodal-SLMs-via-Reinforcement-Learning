                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left lower lobe VATS wedge biopsy.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Two tubes overlie the left chest, presumably both left chest tubes.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, which has progressed compared with
 ___.  On the right, there is upper zone redistribution and increased
 interstitial markings, more pronounced at the right base, and possible
 prominence of the right hilum, similar to the prior film.  There is new
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with a small
 amount of pleural fluid.    Possible small pulmonary nodular density in the
 right mid zone partially  obscured by an EKG lead. Small bleb is also present
 along the right mid chest wall. 
 
 Clips are again noted overlying the right base, likely within the breast.
 Also, there appears to be a pigtail catheter in the left upper quadrant.
 
 At the periphery of these films, findings consistent with a chronic left
 shoulder rotator cuff tear and glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apparent two left chest tubes.  No obvious pneumothorax.  
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and elevated left
 hemidiaphragm.
 3.  Upper zone redistribution and increased interstitial markings are more
 pronounced at the base in the right lung, with prominent right hilum,
 unchanged.  New small right effusion.
 4.  Possible small right mid-lung pulmonary nodule seen laterally.
