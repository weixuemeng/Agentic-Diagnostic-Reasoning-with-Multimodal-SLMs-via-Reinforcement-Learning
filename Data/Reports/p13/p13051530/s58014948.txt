 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Seizures.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature remains engorged, although to a slightly lesser extent as compared
 to the prior study.  The right pulmonary artery remains enlarged.  Surgical
 clips are again seen projecting over the right lower hemithorax, similar to
 prior.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
