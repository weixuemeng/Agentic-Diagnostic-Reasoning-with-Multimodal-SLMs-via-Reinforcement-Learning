 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe status post wedge resection, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the postoperative
 consolidation in the left lower lobe has decreased in size and extent.  The
 left lung base is better ventilated than on the previous image.  Moreover,
 there is less pulmonary fluid, as reflected by smaller pulmonary vessels.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Clips projecting over the
 right breast are unchanged.
