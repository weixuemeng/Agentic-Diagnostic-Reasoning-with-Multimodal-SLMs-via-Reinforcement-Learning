                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain after recent thoracoscopy for left lower lobe malignancy with
 pain at the surgical site.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.  CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were viewed.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with severe
 enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. There is no pneumothorax. A fluid
 collection in the left lung base projects posteriorly on the lateral view and
 is new since the prior study.  Consolidation in the superior segment of the
 left lower lobe is also new.  Surgical clips projecting over the right mid
 lung zone may relate to overlying breast tissue. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Fluid collection in the left lower chest post procedure, which may reflect an
 infectious process. Consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower
 lobe may represent pneumonia.
