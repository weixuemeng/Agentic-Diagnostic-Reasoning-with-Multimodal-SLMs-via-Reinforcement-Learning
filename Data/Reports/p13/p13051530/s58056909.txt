 There small bilateral pleural effusions seen best on the lateral film. There
 is hazy opacity in both lower lungs. Some of this is due to volume loss but an
 underlying infectious infiltrate can't be excluded. However, overall the
 appearance is improved compared to the study from the prior day. The heart
 continues to be moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
