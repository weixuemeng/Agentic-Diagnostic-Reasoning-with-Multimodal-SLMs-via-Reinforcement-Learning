                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 8:57 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to same day examination from ___ hours earlier, there
 appears to be subtle increased opacities seen in the lower posterior lung
 fields clearly on the lateral view only without a clear frontal correlate. 
 This may correspond to some retrocardiac densities.  This is likely
 atelectatic in nature; however, underlying infection cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle heterogeneous opacities in the lower posterior lung field
 seen only on the lateral view.  This is likely atelectatic, however, pneumonia
 remains a consideration.
