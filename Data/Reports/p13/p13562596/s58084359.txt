                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again
 noted.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema demonstrated.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Pneumonia,
 however, cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
