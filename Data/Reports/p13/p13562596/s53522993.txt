                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  DKA, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  As a consequence, there is increased vascular crowding at the lung
 bases and hilar structures are slightly larger than before.  No evidence of
 pneumonia or other acute lung disease.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.
