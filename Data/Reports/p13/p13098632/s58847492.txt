                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a single-lead pacemaker whose lead terminates in the right
 ventricle, as before.  The heart is slightly enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. 
 Slight blurring of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour may be due to a
 parenchymal opacity, probably minor atelectasis and it is difficult to exclude
 a very small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected minor atelectasis at the right lung base, otherwise
 unremarkable.  If symptoms were to persist then standard PA and lateral
 radiographs could be considered in short-term followup.
