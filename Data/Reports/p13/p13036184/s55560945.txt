                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest tube placement for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A chest tube has been advanced somewhat and  projects over the right
 hemithorax appropriately.  There is an abrupt turn at the side hole marker. 
 This examination depicts a trace pleural effusion on the right, but a small
 pneumothorax is no longer apparent.  A small quantity of subcutaneous
 emphysema is noted.  The left lung remains clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pleural effusion which was not apparent on the most recent prior
 examination none with the same technique.  This appearance could represent
 some accumulating pleural effusion noting the setting of recent active
 bleeding although it is possibly due to repositioning of fluid.
