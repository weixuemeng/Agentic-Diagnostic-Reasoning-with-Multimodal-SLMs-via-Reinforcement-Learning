                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Active extravasation and hemothorax on the right status post
 chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On the right, there has been interval placement of a chest tube projecting
 over the right hemithorax.  There is a new small quantity of subcutaneous
 emphysema associated with tube placement and a small pneumothorax. Vague
 opacity in the left upper the right upper lung is more suggestive of
 atelectasis than a substantial effusion. The right-sided effusion is probably
 still fairly small at most and may have been evacuated. The left lung remains
 clear.  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post right-sided chest tube placement.  Small pneumothorax and
 subcutaneous emphysema, although not necessarily unanticipated following
 recent instrumentation.  Short-term follow-up radiography is suggested.  No
 definite pleural effusion identified but technique may be limited for
 assessing small effusions.
