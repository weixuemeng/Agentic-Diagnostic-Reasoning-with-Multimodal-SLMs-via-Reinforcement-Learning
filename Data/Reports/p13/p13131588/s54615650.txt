                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a period of hypotension and confusion, now
 improved.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside plain film performed at ___ from earlier the same
 day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is left basilar
 opacity which is thought to represent at least some component of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, noting that underlying infection is also possible. 
 Fluid also seen tracking along the left major fissure and lateral to the lung
 more superiorly.  The right lung remains clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess given silhouetting on the left.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications seen in the arch and descending thoracic aorta.  Tubing
 overlying the anterior aspect of the chest is likely a ventriculoperitoneal
 shunt.  Lower thoracic/upper lumbar dextroscoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity thought to represent at least some component of
 pleural effusion also tracking laterally and within the major fissure.  There
 is likely underlying atelectasis with infection not excluded.
