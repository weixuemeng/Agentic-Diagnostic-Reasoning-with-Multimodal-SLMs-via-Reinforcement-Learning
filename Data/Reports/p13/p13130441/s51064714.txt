                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p pigtail placement for ?hemothorax  // eval
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ and targeted review of chest
 CT from ___ at 01:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right chest tube is present at the right lung base.  The appearance is not
 suggestive of a conventional pigtail catheter.  Small area of hazy opacity at
 the right lung base could reflect a combination of atelectasis and minimal
 pleural fluid.  No gross effusion is identified.  Of note, there is a small
 right apical pneumothorax.
 
 On the left, there is minimal pleural fluid and minimal basilar atelectasis. 
 No left apical pneumothorax.
 
 Borderline upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged.  Background COPD again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal residual right pleural fluid in the setting of a right lung base
 chest tube.  Small left effusion.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater the left.
 3. Small right apical pneumothorax, which is apparently new.  (Subsequent film
 from ___ at 07:19 shows that this is slightly smaller. )
