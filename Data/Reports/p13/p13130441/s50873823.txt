                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new R sided chest tube  // r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:35
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Again seen is a small right apical pneumothorax, probably very slightly
 smaller compared with the prior film.
 
 Atelectasis and minimal pleural fluid at the left base are also again seen. 
 The degree of atelectasis may be very slightly worse.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is the chest tube at the right lung base, with right base
 atelectasis medially, but no gross right pleural effusion.     No left-sided
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right apical pneumothorax remains present, very slightly smaller than on
 the prior film.
 2. Left base atelectasis may be slightly worse.
 3. Otherwise, I doubt significant change.
