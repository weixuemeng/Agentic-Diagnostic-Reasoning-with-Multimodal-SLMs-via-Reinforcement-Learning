                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, immunosuppressed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are clear. 
 Previously seen effusions have essentially resolved with perhaps minimal
 residual effusion on the left.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity most suggestive
 of atelectasis.  The lungs are clear of consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified.  Coronary artery stents are identified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete resolution of previously seen effusions without
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
