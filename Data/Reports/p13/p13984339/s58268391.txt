                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate persistent
 opacity in the right upper lung, suggestive of persistent or new infection. 
 This is in similar location as prior infection.  The remainder of the lungs
 appears well aerated.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacity in the right upper lung, suggestive of
 pneumonia in the setting of fever and cough.  Recommend followup to
 resolution, particularly given recurrent infection in the same location
 following treatment.
