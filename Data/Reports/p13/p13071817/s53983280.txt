                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and dropping oxygen saturation, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest read in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 The lower lobes are symmetrically involved by a diffuse process consisting of
 mildly dilated and generally thick-walled bronchi, peribronchial infiltration
 that is predominantly linear, and thickening of interlobular septae.  A CT of
 the abdomen showing the lower chest performed on ___ adds the detection of
 acinar-sized nodules, some of which are confluent at the lung periphery and
 confirms the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions.  The upper lungs
 are grossly clear.  The heart is normal size, and there is no vascular
 congestion.  Does this patient have a chronic condition, specifically
 congenital bronchiectasis, the most common cause of which is cystic fibrosis? 
 If not, this is a severe atypical pneumonia including virus, mycoplasma,
 chlamydia, or, conceivably, pertussis, less likely pneumocystis.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
