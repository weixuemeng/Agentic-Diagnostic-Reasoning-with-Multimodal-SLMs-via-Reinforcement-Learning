                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Evaluation of the right apex is obscured by the patient's chin.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely is chronic and
 likely reflects pleural thickening.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
