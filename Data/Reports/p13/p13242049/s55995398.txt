 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:52 PM
  Low lung volumes.  Increased retrocardiac density with linear opacity over
  lower spine on lateral projection - possible subsegmental atelectasis or
  pneumonia in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  No effusions. no
  pneumothorax.  No edema or vascular congestion. Moderate distension of the
  colon below the diaphragm. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 with retrocardiac opacification most likely reflecting atelectasis.  However,
 the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  Persistent elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragmatic contour.  There is dilatation of gas-filled loops of
 predominantly colon consistent with ileus.
