                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluation for mild fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been removed.  The PICC line remains in place.  Unchanged low lung volumes and
 moderate cardiomegaly as well as areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  A
 lucency at the right lung base, projecting over the lungs, is likely caused by
 a colonic loop and is unchanged since the previous examination.
 
 No major pleural effusions.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  Minimal fluid
 overload.
