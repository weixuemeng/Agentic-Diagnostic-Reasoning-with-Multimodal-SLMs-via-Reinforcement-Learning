                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with right wedge biopsy, rule out pneumothorax.  Chest
 tube clamped for four hours.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A chest tube projects in apical hemithorax.  Very tiny line less than 4 mm is
 seen on the axillary portion of right lung that could represent a very small
 stable pneumothorax or sparing of subpleural lung.  Bilateral opacities, most
 predominant in the right lung are unchanged.  The mediastinal and cardiac
 contours are stable.  There is no significant pleural effusion.  Right
 subcutaneous air is unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Patient with recent biopsy for bilateral lung opacities.  Minimal stable right
 pneumothorax versus spared lung.
