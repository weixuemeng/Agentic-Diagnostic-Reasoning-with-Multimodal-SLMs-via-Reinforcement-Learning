                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with a wedge biopsy right lower lobe.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right chest tube has been removed.  Possible axillary residual
 pneumothorax versus spared aerated subpleural lung is unchanged.  Subcutaneous
 air is also stable.  Bilateral chronic lung consolidation is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Chest tube has been removed.  Possible minimal pneumothorax is unchanged. 
 This could also represent spared lung in the subpleural region.
