                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium, unchanged.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with rightward deviation of the mediastinal structures again
 demonstrated is a result of the right sided volume loss.  Patient is status
 post partial right lung resection which chain sutures noted.  Consolidative
 opacities with bronchiectasis are noted within the right upper perihilar
 region as well as within the right lung base, relatively unchanged compared to
 the prior exam.  Ill-defined nodular opacities within the left lung base are
 also relatively unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung consolidative opacities and ill-defined nodular opacities in the
 left lung base are similar compared to the prior exam without new focal
 opacity to suggest a superimposed pneumonia.
