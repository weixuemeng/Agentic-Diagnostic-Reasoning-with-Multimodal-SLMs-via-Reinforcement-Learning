                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with lung infiltrates and mediastinal adenopathy,
 transbronchial biopsy.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no pneumothorax post-biopsy.  The right PICC line has been removed
 since prior exam and there is a right Port-A-Cath ending in the lower SVC. 
 Right lower lung opacity has increased:  this most likely representa
 hemorrhage secondary to lung biopsy.  The other lung opacities mostly in right
 lung but also in the left lower lung are stable.  Mediastinal widening
 compatible with lymph node enlargement is stable.  There is no significant
 pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There is no pneumothorax post-biopsy.  Right lower lung increased opacity is
 most likely compatible with hemorrhage post-biopsy.
