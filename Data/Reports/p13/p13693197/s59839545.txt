                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and neutropenia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest show a right MediPort which
 terminates within the right atrium.  Again, there is significant volume loss
 of the right hemithorax in part due to prior lung resection, as evidenced by
 chain sutures, and scarring and bronchiectasis.  Consolidative focus of tumor
 is again seen within the left low lung, best appreciated on the frontal view,
 and unchanged from the prior CT.  There are no new lesions seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is elevation of the right hilus from volume loss.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Given the complexity of changes,
 if concern persists for an acute process, a CT should be considered.
