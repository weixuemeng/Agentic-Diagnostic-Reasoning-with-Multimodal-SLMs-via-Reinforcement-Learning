                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post right VATS and right lower lobe
 wedge biopsy, now requiring assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate worsening right pleural
 effusion.  There is also atelectasis and volume loss seen on the right with an
 associated mediastinal shift 3 cm to the right.  Chest tube is again seen on
 the right.  Other support and maintenance devices are as the same as
 previously seen.  There are low lung volumes likely related to low inspiratory
 effort.  The left lung base opacity is unchanged from previous imaging.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent diffuse right lung opacities which are slightly
 worsened in the interval.  Persistent right lung atelectasis and volume loss
 with mediastinal shift to the right.  Unchanged left basilar opacities.
