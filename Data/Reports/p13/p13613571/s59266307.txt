                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, evaluate for effusion following drop in
 hematocrit.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates no significant
 change in bibasilar opacities likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis
 and effusion, though left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The
 cardiac silhouette is notable for early postoperative enlargement, unchanged. 
 Median sternotomy wires and post-surgical changes of CABG are again noted.  A
 right IJ central venous catheter tip is unchanged in position.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities reflecting a combination of atelectasis and
 effusion (left greater than right) are unchanged.
