                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain postoperatively.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in
 an upright position with AP technique.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the right central venous
 catheter. Bibasilar pulmonary opacities, left greater than right, appear
 similar compared to prior and likely represent a combination of effusion and
 atelectasis, although left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded. Mild
 pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval. No pneumothorax is
 detected on this view.  Heart size is enlarged.  The aorta is calcified. 
 Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips likely reflect prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left greater than right basilar opacities which may
 represent pleural effusion and atelectasis, but left lower lobe pneumonia
 cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly worse.
