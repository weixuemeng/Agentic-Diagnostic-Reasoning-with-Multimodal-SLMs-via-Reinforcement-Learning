                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and with rapid
 ventricular response, status post transesophageal echocardiogram 4 hours
 prior, now mottled and diaphoretic.  Evaluate for pneumomediastinum.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right internal jugular catheter tip projects within the mid SVC.  A right
 basilar Pleurx catheter is in stable position.  Since the prior examination,
 there is increased apparent lucency demonstrated in the left aspect of the
 aortic knob, that though may be projectional, pneumomediastinum cannot be
 excluded.  There is improvement in bibasilar opacification, likely
 atelectases.  In addition, there is improvement in pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Apparent lucency demonstrated in the left aspect of the aortic knob, that
 though may be projectional, pneumomediastinum cannot be excluded.  If of
 clinical concern, chest CT can be performed.
 2.  Interval improvement in interstitial edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:20 p.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___.
