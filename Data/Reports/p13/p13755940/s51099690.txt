 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:22 PM
  No evidence for pneumothorax. Interval placement of right inferior pigtail
  catheter, incompletely imaged. Interval decrease in right pleural effusion.
  Right basilar opacity may represent pneumonia, contusion, perhaps focal
  reexpansion pulmonary edema. Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and
  cardiomegaly. Discussed with ___ by phone at ___:!5 on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old with right-sided pleural effusion due to
 cardiac causes, now status post therapeutic thoracentesis, evaluate for
 pneumothorax, position of catheter.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 A single portable upright chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the superior vena cava.
 A right basilar pigtail catheter has been placed and is incompletely
 visualized on the current examination.  
 
 2. Interval decrease in size of a right pleural effusion with residual patchy
 basilar opacity, which could reflect residual compressive atelectasis,
 reexpansion pulmonary edema, contusion, and less likely pneumonia.  Persistent
 left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity, which most likely reflects
 partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Heart remains
 enlarged.  Cervical fusion hardware is seen projecting over the mid cervical
 spine.
