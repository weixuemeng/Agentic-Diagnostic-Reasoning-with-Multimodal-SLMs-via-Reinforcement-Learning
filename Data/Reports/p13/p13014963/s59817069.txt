 associated retrocardiac airspace opacity suggestive of atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Smaller right effusion and adjacent atelectasis
 is also again seen.  Interval appearance of mild perihilar and interstitial
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Marked degenerative changes of both shoulder joints
 suggesting chronic rotator cuff tears, right greater than left.
