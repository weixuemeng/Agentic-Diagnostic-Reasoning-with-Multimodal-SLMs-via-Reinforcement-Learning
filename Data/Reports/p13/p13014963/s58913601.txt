                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper
 SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is similar to the previous study.  Mediastinal contours are
 relatively unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval,
 with moderate size left and small to moderate right bilateral pleural
 effusions, also new in the interval.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the upper SVC.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral small to moderate size pleural
 effusions and bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.
