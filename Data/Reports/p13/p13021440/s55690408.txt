                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with tracheostomy, transferred from outside
 hospital with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiographs of the chest were obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy is in standard position.  A right central venous
 catheter terminates in the low superior vena cava.  A right PICC terminates in
 the expected location of the right subclavian vessels.  Right upper lung
 linear opacities likely represent atelectasis.  Subtle opacity over the right
 lower lung field may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or a small focus of
 infection.  Retrocardiac linear opacity likely represents atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on these views.  Heart size is
 enlarged but may be exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  There
 is mediastinal venous fullness.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle hazy opacity over the right mid-to-lower lung field, which
 most likely represents atelectasis, but a small focus of infection cannot be
 excluded.
