                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent placement of dialysis catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___ at 2:53
 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left hemodialysis catheter is still pointing upward toward the distal right
 subclavian vein and not the superior vena cava.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has worsen since the previous exam.  The increase in
 right lower lobe opacity could be related to asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, atelectasis, new aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Tracheostomy is in adequate position.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left hemodialysis catheter is still pointing upward in the right distal
 subclavian vein.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema has increased.
 3.  Increase in density at the right lower lobe could be due to asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, atelectasis or new aspiration or pneumonia.
 
 
 This has been discussed with the medical team.
