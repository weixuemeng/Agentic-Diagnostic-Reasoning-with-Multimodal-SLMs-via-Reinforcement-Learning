                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with sepsis, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 Left lung opacities that appeared between ___ and ___
 have rapidly improved on today's exam most likely representing aspiration or
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  There is still mild residual pulmonary congestion
 with bibasilar opacities which could represent atelectasis and small pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiac enlargement is stable. 
 Right hemodialysis catheter has been removed and new left hemodialysis
 catheter's distal end is pointing towards the distal right subclavian vein and
 not the superior vena cava.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left lung opacity has rapidly improved, most likely representing
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or aspiration rather than infection.
 2.  New left hemodialysis catheter is pointing towards right distal subclavian
 vein and not the superior vena cava.  
 
 This has been discussed with Dr. ___ in the medical team.
