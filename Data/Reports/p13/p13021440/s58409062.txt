 A tracheostomy tube terminating 5 cm above the carina, left upper extremity
 PICC terminating in the mid SVC and a left central venous catheter in the
 right atrium are all unchanged in position since the prior study.  Mild hazy
 bibasilar opacities, most likely atelectasis.  No consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.
