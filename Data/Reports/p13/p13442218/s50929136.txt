                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with seizures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  Rightward shift of mediastinal structures due to volume loss in
 the right lung is similar compared to the prior study.  The hila bilaterally
 remain prominent, but unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new. 
 Bronchiectasis is again demonstrated within the right perihilar region. 
 Patchy opacity is also noted in the left lower lobe, possibly atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic volume loss in the right lung with right perihilar bronchiectasis, as
 seen previously.  Patchy left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis but
 aspiration or infection is not excluded and correct clinical setting.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
