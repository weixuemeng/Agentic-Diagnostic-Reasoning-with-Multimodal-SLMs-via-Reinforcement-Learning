                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post ERCP and biliary stent removal, now
 with epigastric pain, rule out perforation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 There is mild right basilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  No subdiaphragmatic air is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  No visualized subdiaphragmatic air.  If high clinical suspicion for
 perforation, a repeat standing radiograph or a CT would be more sensitive for
 detection of subdiaphgragmatic air.
