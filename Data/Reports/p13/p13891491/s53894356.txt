                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest provided.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged.  There is limited evaluation due to low lung volumes.  Subtle
 left lower lung opacity is seen projecting behind the heart, which could
 represent early pneumonia.  A lateral view would be helpful to confirm. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear without evidence of effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to low lung volumes.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Possible left lower lobe opacity which could represent pneumonia and
 correlation with lateral view would be helpful to confirm.
