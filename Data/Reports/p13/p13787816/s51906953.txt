                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bacteremia  // Assess lungs      Assess
 lungs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs, ___ through ___.
 
 On ___, mild pulmonary edema improved while multifocal consolidation
 developed.  Consolidation has substantially cleared from the left midlung, but
 is still severe in both lower lobes, although due in part to atelectasis,
 suggesting substantial pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly has not improved. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but there is probably no substantial edema.
 
 Tip of the ET tube at the thoracic inlet is no less than 7.5 cm from the
 carina with the chin down.  It should be advanced between 3 and 4 cm for more
 secure positioning.  Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Esophageal
 drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Suggest advancing ETT between 3 and 4 cm.
