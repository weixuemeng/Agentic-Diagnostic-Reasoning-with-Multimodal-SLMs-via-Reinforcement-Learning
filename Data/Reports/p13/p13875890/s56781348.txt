                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with brain stem tumor s/p resection , pnemonia 
 // evaluate pulmonary edema /pneumonia      evaluate pulmonary edema
 /pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are stable.  The nasogastric tube extends to the mid to lower body of
 the stomach, where it coils on itself so that the tip lies just under the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour.
 The patient has taken a much better inspiration.  Continued indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  More
 coalescent opacification is suggested at the right base.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent a developing consolidation.  Although
 somewhat obscured by overlying device, a similar process may be present at the
 left base.
