                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable semi-upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fourth ventricle tumor  // ? ett ,
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged with mild cardiomegaly and
 central venous engorgement.  In comparison to chest x-ray dated ___
 bibasilar opacities have improved on the right and increased on the left when
 compared with ___ study, likely representing asymmetric pulmonary
 edema versus aspiration pneumonia (in the appropriate clinical setting).  A
 small left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
 ETT position has been adjusted and projects 2.8 cm superior to the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement of right basilar opacity and increase of left basilar
 opacity suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema though aspiration pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  ETT position has been adjusted and projects 2.8 cm superior to the carina.
