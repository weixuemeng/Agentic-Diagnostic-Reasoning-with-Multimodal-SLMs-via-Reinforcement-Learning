 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for wide mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  There is a minimal left pleural effusion
 with areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases.  The mediastinum is not
 widened, the mediastinal stripes and reflections are all visible.  No evidence
 of apical fluid collection.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 retrocardiac opacities should be monitored to exclude the possibility for
 early pneumonia.
