                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough for six weeks.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Tortuous aorta is unchanged.  Lungs are essentially
 clear except for new faint opacity at the mid right lung projecting over the
 posterior aspect of eighth rib, most likely representing summation of shadows
 but nodular opacity might be a possibility.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Reevaluation of the patient with anterior oblique views is recommended for
 precise characterization of the abnormality.
