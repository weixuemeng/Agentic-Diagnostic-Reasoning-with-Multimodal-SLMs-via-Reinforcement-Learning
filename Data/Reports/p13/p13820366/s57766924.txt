 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette with a globular
 configuration is similar compared to the prior exam and likely reflective of a
 moderate sized pericardial effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view suggestive of a trace left pleural
 effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. No pneumothorax is identified.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely due to the
 presence of a moderate pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion
 with small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.
