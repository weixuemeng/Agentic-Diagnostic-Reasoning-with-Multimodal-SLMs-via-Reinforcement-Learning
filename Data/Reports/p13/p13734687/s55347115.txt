                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Region of peribronchial infiltration in the infrahilar right lung has
 improved.  Some of this is due to greater lung volumes, but there may have
 been pneumonia.  Lungs elsewhere are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of
 central lymph node enlargement.  Thickening of the right lateral pleural
 sulcus is probably chronic.  Heart size is normal.  Left pleural surface is
 unremarkable.
