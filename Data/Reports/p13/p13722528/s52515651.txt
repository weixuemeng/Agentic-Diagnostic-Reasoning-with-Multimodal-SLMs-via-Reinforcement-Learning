                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 The assessment of the radiograph demonstrates substantial improvement in the
 right upper lobe consolidation with current appearance being similar to
 ___.  Based on that reflects the presence of subpleural
 interstitial opacities that might potentially reflect interstitial lung
 disease.  Lungs are hyperinflated but no new abnormalities are demonstrated. 
 The heart size is enlarged but stable.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 Still slightly more pronounced opacity in the right apex is present and
 reassessment in four weeks for documentation of complete resolution is
 suggested.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
