                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent pneumonia on prior imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lobe in ___ is most
 readily explained by pneumonia.  That has largely resolved, but there is still
 irregular opacification, best appreciated on the lateral view as well as the
 possibility of a ___-mm wide nodule projecting just anterior to the ascending
 thoracic aorta.  For that reason, I would recommend chest CT scanning if
 nothing else to establish baseline appearance of hyperinflated lungs, probably
 due to emphysema.  Heart size is top normal, but there is no pulmonary or
 mediastinal vascular engorgement, edema or pleural effusion.
