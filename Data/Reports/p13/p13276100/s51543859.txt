                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of kidney transplant presents with
 increased generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion, fevers
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is top normal with a left ventricular predominance. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present without pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, and no focal consolidation
 is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Moderate
 hypertrophic changes are again demonstrated within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.
