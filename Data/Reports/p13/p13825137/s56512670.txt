                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new hypoxia, tachypnea.  // eval for
 volume status, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT of the chest from earlier today
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax
 identified.  The trace bilateral pleural effusions are better assessed on the
 earlier CT of the chest.
 
 Since the prior radiograph the tip of the left PICC line has been retracted,
 now projecting over the upper SVC with the tip folded back on itself and
 likely extending into the azygos vein.  A feeding tube extends below the level
 of the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  Low bilateral lung volumes.
 
 Since the prior radiograph there has been interval retraction of the left PICC
 line as described above.
