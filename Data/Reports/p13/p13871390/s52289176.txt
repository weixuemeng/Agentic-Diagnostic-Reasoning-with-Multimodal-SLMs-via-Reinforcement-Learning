                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with  shortness of breath.  History of pneumothorax after
 wedge resection of an aspergilloma, status post talc pleurodesis.  Evaluate
 for acute process and PICC line position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, the left PICC has been retracted, now with
 tip in the upper SVC, possibly flipped into the azygos vein.  The crescentic
 lucency overlying the right lung apex is probably the known small right apical
 pneumothorax last imaged on ___.
 
 Postsurgical changes in the right lung including bronchial valves, pleural
 thickening, and pleural fluid, are unchanged.  The previous large bulla in the
 superior segment of the left lower lobe was better characterized on this chest
 CT of ___.  The opacity at the level of the left hilum is unchanged. 
 The heart is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The left PICC has been retracted, with tip in the region of the upper SVC,
 possibly flipped into the azygos vein.  Lateral chest radiograph could be
 obtained for localization.
 
 2.  Multiple postoperative right lung changes have not substantially changed
 since ___.  However, for more definitive characterization in this
 newly symptomatic patient, consider chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 02:15 on ___, ___ min after discovery.
