 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:41 PM
  Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval improvement of a
  tiny kink/density at the tip of the left PICC line, suggesting improved
  positioning, with the tip now likely terminating in the upper SVC.  Evaluation
  with a lateral chest radiograph can be obtained for definite localization if
  desired.  The findings were discussed with ___ NP, M.D. by ___
  ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 6:59 PM, 5 minutes after
  discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PICC  // PICC position after power flush
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a left PICC in the upper SVC.  Otherwise, no significant
 change.  Right apical fluid plus/minus air, sutures, and endobronchial valves
 are unchanged.  Small dependent right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Heart
 size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved position of a left PICC terminating in the upper SVC.  Otherwise,
 little significant change.
