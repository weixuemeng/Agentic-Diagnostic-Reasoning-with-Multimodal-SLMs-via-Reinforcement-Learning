                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothorax  // ?follow pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the small to moderate pneumothorax surrounding the right upper
 lobe, overall similar in configuration to the prior study.  The densely
 opacified rind of right lung apex is now better aerated.  Again seen are intra
 bronchial valves, right mid lung chain sutures, and a right-sided chest tube. 
 Also again seen is the right perihilar opacity and triangular right infrahilar
 opacity as well as blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  Background
 parenchymal and bullous changes noted.
 
 The mediastinum were remains relatively midline.
 
 On the left, the appearance is overall similar, with extensive apical bullous
 change and parenchymal opacities and probable slight superior hilar
 retraction.  There is a focal irregular opacity measuring approximately ___ x
 28 mm.  Although this was less apparent on the prior CXR, it has a
 corresponding abnormality on the ___ chest CT.  There is slight
 blunting of left costophrenic angle which appears new.  Minimal atelectasis/
 scarring at the left lung base and no gross left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right upper chest pneumothorax is overall similar, though the right lung
 apex parenchymal tissue is better aerated than it was on the prior study.
 
 Focal left midzone opacity is better seen than on the previous chest x-ray,
 but there is keeping with findings on the recent CT scan.
 
 Possible minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, without gross left
 effusion.
