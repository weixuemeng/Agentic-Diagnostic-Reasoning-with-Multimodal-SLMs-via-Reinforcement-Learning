                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with clamp trial  // ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 09:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right chest tube remains in place.
 
 Compared with the prior study, an oblong locule of air at the right lung apex
 is slightly larger.  The large rind of fluid density along the right lung apex
 and upper right chest wall remains visible.  On the current exam, this
 appearance suggests a relatively large hydropneumothorax around the right
 upper lung, with a width of approximately 2.7 cm, with associated slight
 depression of the apex of the lung itself.
 
 Note is again made of parenchymal changes in the right lung apex, with chain
 sutures, and ITB valves.  The small right effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation is similar to the prior study.
 
 Possible mild volume loss on the right, given suggestion of slight
 hyperinflation of left lung.
 
 Apical changes in left lung are similar.  No gross left lung effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable hydro pneumothorax about the upper right lung and right lung apex,
 with depression of the aerated portion of the lung.
 
 Aside from slight increase in the amount of air seen at the right lung apex,
 there is minimal interval change compared with ___ at 09:50.  T
 
 The distance between the right upper thorax and apex of the right lung is
 similar to ___ at 07:47, but more fluid is present in the pleural
 space on the current study.
