                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA on abx, rising WBC  // worsening PNA    
 worsening PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Again there is extensive pulmonary scarring with bronchiectasis and
 chronic right pleural abnormalities.  Lucency along the right lateral chest
 wall with absence of pulmonary markings suggests a region of loculated
 pneumothorax.  Increased opacification at the bases could reflect bilateral
 pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.
