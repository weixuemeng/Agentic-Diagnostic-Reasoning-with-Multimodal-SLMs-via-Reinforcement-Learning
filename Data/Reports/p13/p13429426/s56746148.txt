                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and more recent PET-CT
 dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5
 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena
 cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  There is new mild to moderate central
 vascular hilar congestion and, at the left lung base, volume loss with a new
 pleural effusion probably including atelectasis.  Known carcinoma is not
 visible on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Volume loss and
 opacification of the left lung base, probably due to a pleural effusion with
 atelectasis.
