                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB  // Pneumothorax/SOB     
 Pneumothorax/SOB
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ at 15:40 and 19:19.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is little discernible left pneumothorax, and no appreciable left pleural
 effusion, however there is more subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall
 which is sometimes in indication of increasing intra pleural pressure in the
 setting of pneumothorax.  Therefore repeat chest radiographs would be
 indicated if the patient continues to manifest shortness of breath, even
 though there is little pneumothorax currently.  .
 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  Mediastinum is normal and midline.  Left lung
 mass noted.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed by telephone with the intern caring for
 this patient at 08:30.
