                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient recently admitted with fever,
 consolidation on prior chest examination, treated with levofloxacin for
 pneumonia, now with dizziness and pain on inspiration.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed with a preceding AP single view portable chest
 examination of ___.  Borderline heart size as before, but no
 evidence of significant pulmonary vascular congestion.  The previously
 described scattered bilateral patchy parenchymal infiltrates have not changed
 significantly.  The most marked and sizable infiltrate exists in the right
 upper lobe area.  A left-sided basal infiltrate coincides with local pleural
 effusion which on the lateral view extends into the posterior pleural sinus. 
 The overall appearance of the lung vasculature with relatively low positioned
 and flattened diaphragms and increased interstitial markings gives the
 impression that the patient may have suffered chronically from advanced COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously described multiple scattered parenchymal infiltrates
 of pneumonic character persist.  Lateral view reveals some pleural effusion in
 the left lower pleural sinus and absence of any pneumothorax.
