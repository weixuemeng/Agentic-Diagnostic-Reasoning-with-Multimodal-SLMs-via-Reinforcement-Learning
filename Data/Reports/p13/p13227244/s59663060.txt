                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with esophageal perf and newly placed picc  // eval
 pneumonia and picc placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated which may be due to an
 underlying subpulmonic pleural effusion and/or atelectasis.  No priors are
 available for comparison.  There may be minor left base atelectasis although
 the remainder of the left lung is essentially clear.  No large left pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
