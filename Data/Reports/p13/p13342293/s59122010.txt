                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncopal episodes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The thoracic aorta is
 diffusely calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear.  Blunting of the posterior
 left costophrenic angle on the lateral view suggests a trace left pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No
 acute osseous abnormality seen.  Remote left sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Possible trace left pleural effusion
 versus pleural thickening.
