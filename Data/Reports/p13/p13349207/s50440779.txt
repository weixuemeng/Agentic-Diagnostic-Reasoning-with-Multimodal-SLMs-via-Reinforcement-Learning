                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute agitation, chest pain, off psychiatric medications.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated by the low lung volumes, and
 is likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and the hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Minimal linear and streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild left basilar atelectasis.
