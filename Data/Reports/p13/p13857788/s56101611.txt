                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope and fall  // acute injuries?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are grossly clear without lobar consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Asymmetric apical pleural opacites more
 marked on the right.  When correlated with selected images from the recent
 cervical spine CT dated ___, this corresponds to postinflammatory
 change, bullae and prominent vessels.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  There is
 no acute, displaced rib fracture identified.  No free, subdiaphragmatic air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Biapical pleural opacities consistent with
 postinflammatory scarring and prominent right vasculature.
