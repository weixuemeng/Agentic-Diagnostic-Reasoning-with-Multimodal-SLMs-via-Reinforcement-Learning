 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, both chest tubes have been
 removed.  The mediastinal drains are also removed.  The left venous
 introduction sheath has been replaced by a central venous access line that
 projects over the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena
 cava.
 
 The volumes of the lungs have slightly increased.  Bilaterally, however, there
 is evidence of mild-to-moderate interstitial fluid overload and bilateral
 areas of basal atelectasis.
