 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pleural effusions, recent pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, a pre-existing left
 pleural effusion has minimally increased in extent but is still limited to the
 left costophrenic sinus.  On the right, pre-existing pleural effusion is now
 moderate in extent and occupies the lowermost parts of the right hemithorax. 
 The pre-existing cardiomegaly is constant, as is the tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires, unchanged position
 of the pacemaker and the pacemaker leads.  No evidence of acute lung changes
 such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
