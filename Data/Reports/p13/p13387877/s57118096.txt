                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with concern for leukemia vs. ttp vs. mds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are relatively low and there is lordotic positioning.
 
 The cardial mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for low inspiratory
 volumes.  Slight indistinctness at the right costophrenic angle is noted on
 the AP view, but there is no gross effusion on the lateral view.  . 
 Otherwise, no CHF, focal infiltrate, gross effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 There is a compression deformity of indeterminate chronicity in the lower
 thoracic or upper lumbar spine
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No gross effusion.
 2. Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
 3. A lower thoracic or upper lumbar spine compression deformity is of
 indeterminate chronicity.  Recommend correlation with history and physical
 examination.  If further imaging is desired, then CT or MRI could help for
 further assessment.
