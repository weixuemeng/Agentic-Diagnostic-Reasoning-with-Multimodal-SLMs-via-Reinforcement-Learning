 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Compared with ___ at 23:13 p.m., I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 A right central line is again seen overlying the upper right atrium,
 unchanged.  Multiple right-sided fractures.No obvious pneumothorax. 
 
 Again seen is dense opacity in the right mid zone with mixed lucency and
 opacity at the right lung base, left perihilar lobulated opacity and
 additional opacity at the left base, and a nodular lobulated opacity at the
 right lung apex medially. There is also increased retrocardiac density and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Possibility of small bilateral
 effusions cannot be excluded.   
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed.
 
 Again seen is thoracic spinal fixation hardware.
