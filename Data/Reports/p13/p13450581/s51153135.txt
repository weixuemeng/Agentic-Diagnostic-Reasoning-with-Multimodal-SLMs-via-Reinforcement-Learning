                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  Previously noted left upper lobe mass
 appears more vague with surrounding ill-defined opacity, possibly related to
 infection.  There is a lingular opacity which is new compared to the prior
 study, and could reflect an area of infection.  The right lung is grossly
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Lingular opacity is concerning for infection in the correct clinical
 setting.
 
 2. Previously seen left upper lobe mass appears more vague with adjacent
 ill-defined opacity which could reflect post-treatment changes.
