                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A spiculated and cavitary nodule in the left mid lung at the level
 of the third left anterior rib measuring 2.5 cm in diameter appears slightly
 larger than on the prior radiograph and corresponds to a known left upper lobe
 lesion on prior CT of ___.  It is morphologically concerning for
 a primary lung cancer and less likely an indolent granulomatous infection. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear, with no new focal areas of consolidation to suggest
 the presence of an acute pneumonia.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for linear
 scar versus atelectasis in the mid lung regions. Sclerosis of medial left
 clavicle, likely due to prior trauma, is unchanged.
