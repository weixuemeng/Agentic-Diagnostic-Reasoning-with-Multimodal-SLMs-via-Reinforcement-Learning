 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate
 to large on the right and small on the left, with overlying atelectasis. 
 Patchy lateral right base/mid lung opacity could relate to atelectasis
 however, a focus of consolidation from infection is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal
 contours are grossly stable
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Patchy lateral right
 base/mid lung opacity could relate to atelectasis although consolidation due
 to infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
