                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, but similar compared to
 the previous examination.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified at the aortic
 arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  8 mm nodular opacity is again
 noted projecting over the right lung base, unchanged.  Atelectasis is seen in
 the lung bases without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Unchanged 8 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the right lung base.  Again this may reflect a nipple
 shadow however repeat PA view of the chest with nipple markers is recommended
 for confirmation, as previously suggested.
