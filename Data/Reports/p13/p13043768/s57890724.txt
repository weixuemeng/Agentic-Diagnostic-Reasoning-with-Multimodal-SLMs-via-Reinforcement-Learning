                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVC with right lower rib pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral images of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded and clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  No acute fracture is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2. No acute fracture seen, however chest radiographs are insensitive for
 nondisplaced rib fractures.  If clinical concern persists for buckle fracture,
 recommend dedicated rib views for further evaluation.  If focal tenderness
 exists, this ___ be marked prior to rib views.
