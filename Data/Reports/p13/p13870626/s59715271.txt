                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hemoptysis, bullet near ribs
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated and clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
 is present.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  A bullet
 projects over the right upper quadrant on the frontal projection but the
 anterior chest and abdominal wall is excluded from the field of view on the
 lateral projection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process to explain hemoptysis.
