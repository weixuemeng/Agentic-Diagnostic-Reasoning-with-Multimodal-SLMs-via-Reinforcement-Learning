                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with leukocytosis, part of infectious workup
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Linear opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the left,
 likely reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  No definite large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
