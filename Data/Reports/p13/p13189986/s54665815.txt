                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man diabetes with cough, fever, SOB  // possible
 interval development of infiltrate c/w pneumonia? that would support diagnosis
 of bacterial pneumonia (since ED did portable and also patient got IVF since
 presentation) vs. different pattern that may suggest viral illness
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Asymmetrical biapical pleural and
 parenchymal opacification is unchanged since recent study of 1 day earlier,
 and is more prominent on the right than the left, with associated upper lobe
 volume loss.  Nonspecific patchy bibasilar lung opacities are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent patchy bibasilar opacities, could potentially be due to pneumonia
 given the clinical suspicion for this entity.  Bibasilar distribution suggests
 the possibility of aspiration.
 
 Asymmetrical right apical pleural and parenchymal opacities may potentially be
 due to asymmetrical scarring, but direct comparison to older radiographs of
 available would be helpful to exclude the possibility of a Pancoast tumor.  In
 the absence of older studies for comparison, chest CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to further evaluate asymmetrical opacification of
 the right lung apex.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:41 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
