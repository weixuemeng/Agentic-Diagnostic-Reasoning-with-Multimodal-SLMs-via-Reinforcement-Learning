                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Port dysfunction, here to evaluate port placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.  CT of the
 chest performed, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian-approach Port-A-Cath is accessed and unchanged
 in position with the tip terminating in the upper right atrium.  To place the
 catheter tip in the low SVC, the catheter should be retracted by 2.5 cm. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new from the most recent prior study
 with associated basilar atelectasis on the left greater than the right.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  The heart is normal in size
 with normal mediastinal contours.  Lumbar fusion hardware is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right Port-A-Cath unchanged with tip in the upper atrium.  If placement in
 the low SVC is desired, the catheter could be retracted 2.5 cm.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis on the left
 greater than the right.
