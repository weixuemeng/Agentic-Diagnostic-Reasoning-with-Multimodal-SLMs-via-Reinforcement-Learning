 the image.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities are seen, raising concern for pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Likely skin folds overlie
 the bilateral lateral upper chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 bilateral pleural effusions.  Perihilar opacities suggests component of
 pulmonary edema with some areas of atelectasis.
