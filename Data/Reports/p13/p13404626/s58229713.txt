                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of pneumonia one month ago, follow up.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison in our system.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Questionable asymmetric opacity
 in the right lower lung is noted and might reflect residual of prior
 infection, projecting over the spine on the lateral radiograph.  Dynamic
 changes cannot be assessed in the absence of prior examination.  There are no
 other abnormalities demonstrated within the lungs and there is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
