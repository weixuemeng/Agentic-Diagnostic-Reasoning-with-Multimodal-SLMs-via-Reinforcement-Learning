                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia three months ago requiring two courses of antibiotics.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  A vague right lower zone opacity appears less distinct, and likely
 reflects chronic change from prior infection.  There are no new consolidations
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute pneumonia.  A previously seen vague right
 lower zone dense opacity is unchanged and most likely chronic.
