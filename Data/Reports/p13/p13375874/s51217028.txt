                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is again at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta shows patchy
 calcification and is mildly tortuous.  Band-like opacity in the left lower
 lung is compatible with scarring that appears unchanged.  Similarly, there is
 patchy streaky opacity in the right infrahilar region, also suggestive of
 minor atelectasis or scarring, although new.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.  The bones are
 probably demineralized to some extent, and incompletely visualized, an upper
 lumbar compression deformity is probably unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy medial right basilar opacity, probably attributable to
 minor atelectasis or scarring, although new since the prior study and not
 entirely specific.
