                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, recent stent placement, now with
 hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle is in unchanged position.  There is mild cardiomegaly with a
 left ventricular predominance.  Aortic knob calcifications are re-
 demonstrated.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 within the mid and lower thoracic spine with bridging anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of congestive heart failure or
 pleural effusion.
