                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, evaluate for heart failure or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ at ___ and chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung
 volumes are low, which does result in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is linear bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours, allowing for low lung
 volumes, are normal.
 
 Clips are seen within the upper abdomen.  Left humeral and cervical hardware
 are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
