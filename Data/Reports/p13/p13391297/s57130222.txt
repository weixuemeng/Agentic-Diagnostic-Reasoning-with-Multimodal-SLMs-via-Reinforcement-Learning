                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous, and the
 hilar contours are stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated, similar compared to the
 prior exam, and most likely reflective of atelectasis.  Infection is not
 completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Partially
 imaged is cervical spinal fusion hardware.  Mild elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated, along with multiple clips in the right
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.
