                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD exacerbation former smoker with several
 weeks cough and shortness of breath.  // any infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the subtle parenchymal opacity at the
 bases of the right upper lobe is minimally more subtle but not completely
 resolved. Almost unchanged is a slight thickening of the fissure and a
 platelike atelectasis at the right lung bases. Given the previous history of
 smoking, an given the substantial time interval between the 2 chest
 radiographs, the lesion should be further evaluated using CT, to exclude an
 underlying malignancy.
 No change in appearance of the left lung and of the cardiac silhouette.  Clips
 projecting over the right upper quadrant.
