                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic COPD, worsening chronic cough, T
 ___.7, decreased oxygenation  // please evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar patchy and
 linear opacities are similar to the prior and likely represent atelectasis or
 scarring. There is a subtle opacity adjacent to the minor fissure, not seen on
 the prior exam, which could represent atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is fusion hardware projected
 over the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Subtle, new focal opacity adjacent to the right minor fissure, which could
 represent atelectasis, aspiration or early pneumonia.
 2. Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities are consistent with atelectasis or
 scarring.
