                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tachypnea and wheezing.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:   Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar
 streaky opacities are compatible with atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Assessment of the cardiac size is limited due to limitations of this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Correlate
 with clinical presentation.
