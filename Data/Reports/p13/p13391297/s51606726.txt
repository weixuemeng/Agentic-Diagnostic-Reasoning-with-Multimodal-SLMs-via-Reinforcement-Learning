                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___ as well as
 chest CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous without change.  Bibasilar
 linear atelectasis has improved since ___ radiograph.  However, on
 the lateral view, there is an increased opacity overlying the lower thoracic
 spine, which represents a change from a baseline lateral radiograph of
 ___.  This is not definitively localized on the frontal
 radiograph, but is probably in the right retrocardiac area.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  Mild elevation of right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible early right lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup chest
 radiographs are suggested to document resolution.
