                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  3 days of productive cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This limits assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky and
 linear opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Partially imaged is cervical
 spine fusion hardware as well as 2 screws within the left proximal humerus. 
 Multiple clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit the assessment of the lung bases.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but repeat exam with improved
 inspiratory effort is suggested when the patient is able, to further assess
 the lung bases.
