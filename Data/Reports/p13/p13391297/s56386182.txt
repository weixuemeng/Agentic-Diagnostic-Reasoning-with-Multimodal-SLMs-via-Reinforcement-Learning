                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, history of myocardial infarction.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes, which limits assessment of lung bases.  The
 cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the low lung volumes, but
 is likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Streaky opacities in lung bases likely reflect atelectasis,
 with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted.  No
 free air is noted under the diaphragms.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limits the assessment of the lung bases.  Probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No free air is seen under the diaphragms.
