                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There are low lung
 volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar relative
 linear opacities are again seen which likely represent atelectasis; however,
 is also suggested on the prior study, repeat with improved inspiration is
 suggested when the patient is able for further and better evaluation. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  The metallic surgical hardware is seen in the lower
 cervical spine.  Multiple surgical clips are partially imaged in the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Streaky and linear bibasilar opacities again seen which most likely represent
 atelectasis; however, repeat with improved inspiration when patient able is
 suggested for further evaluation.  Dedicated PA and lateral views may be
 helpful for further evaluation.
