                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of COPD and productive cough. 
 Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates right lobe consolidation
 which, when correlated with CT examination dated ___, most likely
 represents post compressive atelectasis.  There is additional linear opacity
 noted at the left lung base. There is mild bronchial wall thickening.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Surgical cervical hardware is identified in the
 lower cervical spine.  Multiple surgical clips again seen in the right upper
 abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Right lower lobe opacification likely due to compressive atelectasis secondary
 to elevated right hemidiaphram. Consider short term follow up CXR if suspicion
 for pneumonia persists.
