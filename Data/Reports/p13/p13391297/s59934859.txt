                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HTN, COPD  // ?pneumonia.  Decreased O2
 (___%), increased cough, but sig coughing at baseline with severe COPD.  No
 fever.  Prior pneumonia ___ so which to make sure that infiltrate has
 resolved.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, resulting and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal
 contours and crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases.  Within
 this context, predominantly linear bibasilar opacities probably reflect
 atelectasis.  The previously demonstrated left lower lobe opacity has
 decreased in extent on the lateral view.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment due to low lung volumes.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
