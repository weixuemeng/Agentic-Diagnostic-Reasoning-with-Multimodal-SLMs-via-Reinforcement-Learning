                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, however.  There are basilar opacities including a
 layering opacity along the posterior margin of the right hemidiaphragm, highly
 suggestive of atelectasis.  Surgical clips project over the right upper
 quadrant.  The patient is status post anterior cervical fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky basilar opacities are present, suspected to represent
 atelectasis in the setting of very low lung volumes, but it is difficult to
 exclude developing pneumonia at the right lung base.  Short-term follow-up
 radiographs with better inspiration may be helpful to reassess if needed
 clinically.
