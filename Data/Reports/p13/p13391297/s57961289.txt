                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epistaxis, crackles bilaterally.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal linear opacities within both
 lower lobes likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple clips are seen
 within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Partially imaged is hardware
 within the left proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
