                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Slight hyperlucency of
 lower lobes may be related to history of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency with
 basilar predominant emphysema, this is not definitively diagnosed
 radiographically.  Lungs are free of consolidation or substantial atelectasis,
 and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.  Apparent
 saber-sheath configuration of the trachea is present with narrowed
 intrathoracic coronal dimension compared to the sagittal dimension, a finding
 frequently associated with COPD.  In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen,
 prominence of the splenic contour is noted as well as a diffuse haziness,
 likely corresponding to ascites as revealed on recent ___ MR of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
