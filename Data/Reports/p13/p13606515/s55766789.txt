                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with seizure.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified, although this study is not tailored for
 assessment of the ribcage and has suboptimal sensitivity for detection of rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiographic examination.
