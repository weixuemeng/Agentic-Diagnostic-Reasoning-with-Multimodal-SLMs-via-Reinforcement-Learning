                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with multiple right rib fractures status post crash
 by car.  Known pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 A small right pneumothorax is less conspicuous than before.  Right
 subcutaneous emphysema has improved.  Bilateral pleural effusions larger on
 the right side are unchanged.  Right upper lobe atelectasis is stable.  Right
 lower lobe opacity has increased due to increasing atelectasis.  The left lung
 is grossly clear besides the small pleural effusion with minimal adjacent
 atelectasis.  Right rib fractures are again noted.
