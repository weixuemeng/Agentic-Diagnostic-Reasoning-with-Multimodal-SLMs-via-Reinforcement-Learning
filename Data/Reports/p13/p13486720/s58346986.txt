                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly more
 prominent lucency at the right costophrenic angle.  On the lateral view there
 is a thin relatively vertical opacification paralleling the sternum within
 anterior chest wall.  Although this could possibly relate to the extensive gas
 outlining muscle bundles, this probably reflects a small anterior
 pneumothorax.
 
 On the lateral view, the degree of pleural effusion is more prominent on the
 right, with residual small left effusion.
