                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple rib fractures, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, no definite pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  Minimal opacification in the right apical region could reflect
 post-traumatic bleeding.  Several displaced rib fractures are seen on the
 left.  No evidence of acute vascular congestion or pneumonia.
