                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Crush injury, to assess for interval change in pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the
 development of extensive subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest
 wall, extending into the lungs and across the pectoralis muscles.  No definite
 pneumothorax.  Opacification at the bases posteriorly suggests pleural fluid
 and atelectasis.  Evidence of recent rib fractures.
