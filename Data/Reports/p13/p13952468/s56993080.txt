                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: AP semiupright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The
 lungs are low in volume with linear left basilar atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is at most
 top normal in size allowing for AP technique and low lung volumes. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
