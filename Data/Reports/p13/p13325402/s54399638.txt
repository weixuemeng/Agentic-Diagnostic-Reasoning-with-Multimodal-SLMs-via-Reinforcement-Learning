                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abscess.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is limited due to patient rotation.  The heart size is at least
 mildly enlarged, and the aorta remains tortuous.  There is a linear opacity
 within the left lung base likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Severe
 degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are present along with a
 well corticated ossific density adjacent to the distal right clavicle, which
 could reflect the sequelae of prior injury.  Multilevel degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine with retrolisthesis demonstrated at the
 thoracolumbar junction, not significantly changed in the interval.  Partially
 imaged is lumbar spinal fusion hardware.  Deformity of the right thoracic rib
 cage suggests prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Linear atelectasis in the left lung base.  Otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
