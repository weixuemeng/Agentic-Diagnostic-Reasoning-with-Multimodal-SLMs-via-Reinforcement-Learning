                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Renal transplant, evaluation for PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC has been
 pulled back.  The line is now projecting at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava.  For a position in the mid
 SVC, the catheter would need to be advanced by approximately 6 to 7 cm.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No pulmonary edema.
