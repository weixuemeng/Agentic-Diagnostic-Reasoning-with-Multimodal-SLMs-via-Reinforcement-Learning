                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure  // ETT placement?
 Resolution of ARDS?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi upright portable radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes remain low.  There is persistent pulmonary edema, unchanged
 compared to the prior radiograph.  There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly as
 before.  ET tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina in the midtrachea. 
 Bilateral central venous catheters terminate in the SVC.  Enteric tube tip
 terminates in the region of the gastric pylorus.  EKG leads overlie the chest
 wall.  The right humeral head appears slightly subluxed cranially with
 nonvisualization of the distal third of the right clavicle, however these
 changes cannot be further characterized on this single semi upright
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with persistent moderate pulmonary edema and mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly.
 2. ET tube has been repositioned and now terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.
 3. Additional lines and tubes as above.
