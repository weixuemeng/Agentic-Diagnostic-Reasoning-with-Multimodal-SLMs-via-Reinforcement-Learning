                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of mild hemoptysis, recent admission for CHF.  Please
 evaluate for infiltrate.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild tortuosity of the aorta, otherwise
 the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  Linear retrocardiac opacity
 may be atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise clear. Blunting of the lateral left
 costophrenic angle may be due to fat pad.  Posterior costophrenic angles are
 relatively sharp, perhaps minimal blunting on the right.  There is no evidence
 of a pneumothorax. Note is made of left breast implant. The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  Linear retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis
 although infection is not entirely excluded.
