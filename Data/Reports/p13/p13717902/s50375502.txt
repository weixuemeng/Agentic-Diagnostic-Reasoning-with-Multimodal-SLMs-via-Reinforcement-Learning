                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx PNA.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 PA and lateral chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Please note evaluation is
 markedly limited due to motion artifact and suboptimal penetration on the
 lateral film and low lung volumes.
 
 Allowing for this, there is volume loss at the left lung base with linear
 density most likely indicative of atelectasis.  There is blunting of the left
 CP angle on the lateral view suggesting at least a small joint effusion.  The
 right lung appears grossly clear.  The heart size appears relatively
 unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures appear grossly
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with left basal opacity most likely atelectasis with small left
 pleural effusion.
 
 Please note evaluation is markedly limited due to portable technique and if
 needed, a dedicated PA and lateral view may be helpful to further assess.
