 subclavian central venous catheter remains in place terminating at the
 confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  Lung volumes remain low
 with moderate layering bilateral effusions mildly improved on the left with
 associated improved aeration of the left lung base.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged with central pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild
 pulmonary edema.

 Upper enteric tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction and should be
 advanced at least 15 cm.  Otherwise little change from the prior study.
