                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient admitted for seizures, treated for
 possible pneumonia, with elevated white blood count and shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.
 
 Drooping head and chin are obscuring apical portion of the lungs and makes it
 impossible to accurately inspect the superior trachea.  It is assumed that the
 ETT present on the previous examination has been removed.  No pneumothorax can
 be identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is unaltered and there is no
 evidence of any new acute parenchymal infiltrate.  Similar as on the preceding
 examination, the high positioned diaphragms result in crowded appearance of
 the basal pulmonary vasculature with some linear densities on the left base
 most likely representing plate atelectasis.  The diaphragmatic contours can be
 identified and thus there is no evidence of significant pleural effusion on
 either side.  Smaller amounts of pleural effusion would require a lateral view
 to be seen in the posterior dependent pleural sinuses.
 
 Cardiac enlargement of moderate degree is again seen and within the heart
 shadow, one can identify a band of calcium representing mitral annulus
 calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pneumonia on this portable chest
 examination.
