                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with seizure, intubated en root.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray performed in___ earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There has been interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube whose tip is 4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube is seen at
 the region of the distal esophagus and potentially off the inferior field of
 view although not well seen secondary to technique.
 
 Appearance of the lungs has not significantly changed.  Obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragms is thought to be due to positioning and technique.  There is no
 large confluent consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval placement of lines and tubes as above.  No other change.
