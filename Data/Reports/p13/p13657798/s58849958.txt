                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent fever and ? of RLL consolidation on
 exam  // eval for pneumonia      eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple left pleural nodules are new since ___. Some of these are adjacent
 to healed left rib fractures. There is a smaller number of right pleural
 nodules, all of which are adjacent to healed rib fractures, of the fourth and
 sixth anterior and fifth antral lateral ribs. I would recommend rib views of
 both sides of the chest cage to confirm the extent of healed fractures in
 order to exclude a coincidental pleural malignancy.
 
 Lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
