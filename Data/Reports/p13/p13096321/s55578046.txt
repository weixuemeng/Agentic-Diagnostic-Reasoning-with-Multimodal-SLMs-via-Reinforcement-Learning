                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or pulmonary edema is detected.  Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes
 and therefore difficult to evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
