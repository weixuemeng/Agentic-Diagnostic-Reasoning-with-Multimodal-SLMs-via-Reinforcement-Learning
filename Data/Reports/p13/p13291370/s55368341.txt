                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with productive cough and fever and decreased breath
 sounds at both lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggesting
 pulmonary hypertension and hyperinflation of the lungs due to emphysema and/or
 chronic small airways obstruction, but not changed since at least ___.
 What has varied is the radiodensity of heterogeneous opacification at both
 lung bases, more pronounced today than earlier, and concerning for bibasilar
 pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration.  Pleural effusion is minimal if
 any.  Pulmonary edema is probably not present.  A transvenous right
 ventricular pacer lead runs a course through the right ventricle close to the
 pulmonary outflow tract rather than the floor.  No pneumothorax.
