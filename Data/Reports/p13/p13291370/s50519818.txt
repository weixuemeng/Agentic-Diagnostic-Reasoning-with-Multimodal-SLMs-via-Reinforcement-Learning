                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of chest were reviewed in comparison
 with prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Both lungs are well expanded with mild flattening of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragm and increased AP diameter of the chest consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease.  Bilateral prominent pulmonary arteries raise the concern
 for pulmonary artery hypertension.  An ill-defined opacity is seen in
 posterior lower lung in the retrocardiac region overlying the lower spine and
 is concerning for pneumonia.  This opacity is not very well defined on the
 frontal view except for a faint opacity in the right lower paracardiac region.
 A single pacemaker lead from left pectoral pacemaker device terminates into
 the right ventricle.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged since ___.  Mild atherosclerotic calcification of the
 aortic arch is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill-defined opacity appreciated only on the lateral view in the posterior
 inferior lower lung overlying the spine shadow is concerning for pneumonia and
 since it is not clearly defined on the frontal view, it suggests lower lobe
 pneumonia either involving the right or left side.
 
 2.  COPD.
 
 3.  Pulmonary artery hypertension, unchanged since ___.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 5:55
 p.m.
