                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right upper lobe pneumonia, with persistent tachypnea.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer lead is in unchanged
 position.  Main pulmonary arteries are enlarged as before.  The right upper
 lobe pneumonic consolidation has improved as the opacities in the right lower
 lobe.  Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe laterally are most likely
 consistent with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Pulmonary edema has resolved.
