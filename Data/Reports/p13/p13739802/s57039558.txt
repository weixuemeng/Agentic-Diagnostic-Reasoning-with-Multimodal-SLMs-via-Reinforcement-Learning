                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been minimal interval change. 
 Redemonstrated is severe emphysema with increased interstitial markings and
 several large bullae.  There is no definitive consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly is
 noted.  Mediastinal hilar contours are largely unchanged from prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severe emphysema.  Given the patient's baseline chronic lung disease, is
 difficult to exclude a superimposed acute process in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
