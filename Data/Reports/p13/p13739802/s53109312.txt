                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, lower extremity edema and crackles. 
 Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 increased interstitial markings at the bilateral bases, more prominent on the
 right than the left.  This is likely attributable to some underlying lung
 disease, but given the change from the prior CT, also likely represents mild
 pulmonary edema.  The upper lung zones are relatively hyperlucent due to the
 severe emphysematous disease.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 slightly larger on the right than the left.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted in the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased interstitial markings at the bilateral bases is likely due to
 mild pulmonary edema superimposed on underlying lung disease.
 2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Severe emphysematous disease.
