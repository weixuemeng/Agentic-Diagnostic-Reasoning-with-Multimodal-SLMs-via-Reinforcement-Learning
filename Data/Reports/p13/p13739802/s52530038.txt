                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 ___-year-old male status-post fall 1 week prior with several rib fractures on
 the left.  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  This study is read in conjunction with CT of the chest from ___ and CT of the abdomen and pelvis from 3 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate relative flattening of the
 bilateral hemidiaphragms and multiple bullae, consistent with severe
 emphysema.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is identified.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable and the aorta is somewhat tortuous.   Left-sided rib
 deformities are again seen, consistent with healed fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of pneumothorax or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Severe emphysema.
