 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo woman with Grade IIIB follicular lymphoma, now second
 relapse as DLBCL on rituxan day 5 today presents with fever 102 and cough X 1
 week with new chills and fever 102. Also reports myalgia. Recent contact with
 several relatives, unclear if anybody was sick.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve repair.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is similar.  Bilateral hilar prominence is
 compatible with mildly enlarged pulmonary arteries, unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is continued right middle lobe focal
 opacity, not substantially changed since the prior examinations with
 associated bronchiectasis.  Patchy bilateral lower lobe opacities also
 persists, without new focal area of consolidation identified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal consolidation identified.  Persistent right middle lobe focal
 opacity with associated bronchiectasis and patchy bilateral lower lobe
 opacities, previously thought on prior CT to reflect a combination of
 infection and graft-versus-host disease.
