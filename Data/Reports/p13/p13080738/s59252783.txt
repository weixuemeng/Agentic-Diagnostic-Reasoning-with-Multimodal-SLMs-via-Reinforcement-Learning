                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o recurrent lymphoma, evolving pulmonary
 infiltrates and leukocytosis  // ?interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___, PA and lateral views of the chest
 dated ___,
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  A prosthetic mitral valve is
 noted.  Midline sternal wires are well aligned and intact.  Surgical clips are
 seen in the lower neck.  A right-sided catheter is again seen, with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.
 
 The right middle lobe opacity which was seen on recent comparisons appears
 progressed and more confluent than on prior examinations.  Bibasilar opacities
 have remained stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening right middle lobe opacity and persistent bibasilar opacities most
 consistent with multifocal pneumonia, with a component of coexisting
 atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
