                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Sinus congestion and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Although no prior comparison is available, there is increased opacity compared
 to what is usually expected within the right medial lower lung, probably for
 the most part within the right lower lobe.  However, there is also increased
 patchy anterior opacity in the lateral view which is somewhat difficult to
 place on the frontal perspective, either in the right middle lobe of lingula. 
 Bony structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pneumonia.
