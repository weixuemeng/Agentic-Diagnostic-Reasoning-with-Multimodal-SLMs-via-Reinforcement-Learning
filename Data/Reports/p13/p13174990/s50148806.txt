                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left posterior pain, rule out fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours
 are stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Evaluation of
 the bony structures reveals no rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of rib fracture, but a chest radiograph is not
 sensitive for rib fractures. If there are referable symptoms, dedicated rib
 views can be helpful.
