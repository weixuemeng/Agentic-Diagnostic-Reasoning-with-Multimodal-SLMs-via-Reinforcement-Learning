 The heart size remains within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is moderately
 widened and elongated but no local contour abnormalities are identified nor is
 there evidence of wall calcifications.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present
