                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall from ladder with left scapular pain and right pelvic pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette,
 which is likely normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are
 clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No fracture is identified.  Vertebral body heights and
 alignment are maintained, other than an old anterior compression deformity in
 T12.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
