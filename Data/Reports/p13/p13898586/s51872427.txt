                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Focus of air noted behind the heart on the lateral view raises the possibility
 of pneumomediastinum. The cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise normal.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Focus of air noted behind the heart on the lateral view raises the possibility
 of pneumomediastinum, which can be due to acute bronchospasm, although no
 signs suggestive of such in this CXR. Important to consider if history of
 esophageal trauma.
