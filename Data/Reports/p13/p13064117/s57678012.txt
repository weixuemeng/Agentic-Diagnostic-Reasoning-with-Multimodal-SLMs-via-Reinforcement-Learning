                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o metastatic melanoma with mets to lungs, liver, spleen
 transfer from OSH p/w spont splenic hemorrhage, hypotension s/p IR
 embolization proximal splenic artery  // eval for pulmonary process, mets
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from 1 day earlier, bilateral pleural
 effusions have apparently slightly decreased in size, although positional
 differences may contribute to this apparent change.  Adjacent bibasilar
 atelectasis has also decreased in extent.  No other relevant changes.
