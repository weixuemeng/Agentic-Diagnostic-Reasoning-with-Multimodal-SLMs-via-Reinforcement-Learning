 HISTORY:  Cardiogenic shock.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued bilateral
 effusions with compressive atelectasis, though the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia at the bases can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 engorged mediastinal and peripheral vessels indicating elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
