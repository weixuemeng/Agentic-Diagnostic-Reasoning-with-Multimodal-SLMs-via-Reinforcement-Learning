                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Central venous catheter and permanent pacemaker remain unchanged in
 position allowing for positional differences of the patient.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Previously reported multifocal pulmonary opacities have partially cleared with
 residual opacities mostly in the perihilar regions.  This likely reflects
 improving pulmonary edema.  More confluent opacity in left retrocardiac region
 has only slightly improved and is likely due to a combination of atelectasis
 and effusion.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased in size.
