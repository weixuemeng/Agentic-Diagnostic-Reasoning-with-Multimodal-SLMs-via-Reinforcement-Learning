 aspiration, particularly since the stomach is moderately distended and there
 is no enteric drainage tube in place.  Heart is moderately enlarged and
 mediastinal vasculature is engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema.  Right
 internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective
