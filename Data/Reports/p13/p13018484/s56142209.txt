 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:57 PM
  Right PICC line tip is at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  Right and
  left basal opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis, however an acute
  infectious process can't be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:14 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a PICC line since mid ___ and high
 fever.  Evaluate lungs for infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right PICC line is unchanged in position in the region of the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Heart is still moderately enlarged, and there has been
 an increase in mediastinal vascular caliber.  Lung volumes remain low, and a
 band of opacity at the base of the right lung barely visible through the
 liver, is probably atelectasis, though I cannot exclude pneumonia.  Because of
 increased venous caliber in the mediastinum, I would recommend evaluation for
 possible thrombus, perhaps related to catheter infection.  Vascular ultrasound
 should be diagnostic.  
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:40 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
