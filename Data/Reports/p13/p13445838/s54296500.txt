 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:02 AM
  Interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions in the
  setting of mild cardiomegaly. More confluent consolidations are seen in the
  retrocardiac region, which may represent superimposed infectious/ inflammatory
  process in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman postpartum day 5 with preeclampisa s/p
 magnesium currently increasing labetalol for BP control, c/o shortness of
 breath with exertion and laying supine  // eval for pulmonary edema or
 effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominent interstitial lung markings particularly in the perihilar locations
 with bronchial cuffing are most likely due to pulmonary edema. An asymmetric
 airspace opacity at the periphery of the right upper low is more confluent,
 and is worrisome for aspiration versus infection. There are also small
 bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged. The mediastinum is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 More confluent airspace opacity in the peripheral right upper lobe may be due
 to asymmetrical edema, aspiration or infection.
