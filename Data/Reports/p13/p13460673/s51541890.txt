                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with spontaneous left pneumothorax, here to
 reevaluate pneumothorax, status post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 09:49 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show interval removal
 of the left apical pleural pigtail catheter from the preceding radiograph. 
 The small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged in size or distribution.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 without focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small left apical pneumothorax, status post left pleural
 catheter removal.
