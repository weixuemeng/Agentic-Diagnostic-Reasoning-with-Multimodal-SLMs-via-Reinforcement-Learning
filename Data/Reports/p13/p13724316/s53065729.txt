 Subsequent radiographs available the time of this review show the line
 repositioned in the SVC.
 
 
 Bibasilar opacification is probably a combination of atelectasis and dependent
 edema.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural effusion is small, on the left, if any.
 No pneumothorax.
 
 
 ET tube tip ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm
