                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening right-sided weakness.  History of stroke.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There is
 blunting of the right posterior costophrenic sulcus, possibly due to scarring
 versus a very small pleural effusion.  Moderate degenerative changes again
 effect the shoulder.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible small pleural effusion on the right side for which
 direct comparison to prior studies is difficult given the lack of a prior
 available lateral view; otherwise unremarkable.
