                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and wheezing.  History of asthma and COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate unfolding and calcification along the thoracic aorta.  The
 heart is normal in size.  There is a new right lateral pleural thickening with
 a lenticular configuration, as well as mixed patchy opacification and lucency
 overlying adjacent lung parenchyma of uncertain etiology.  This lucency may be
 artifactual but differential considerations include air in a cavity,
 atelectasis, or subtle infection associated with pleural thickening. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right lateral pleural thickening and a vague streaky focal
 lucency in the right lower lung of uncertain etiology but subtle evidence for
 air within a cavity is a differential consideration.  Depending on the acuity
 of findings, chest CT is suggested versus short-term radiographic follow-up is
 suggested.  Correlation with whether there may have been any intercurrent
 illness with a pleural effusion is also suggested.
