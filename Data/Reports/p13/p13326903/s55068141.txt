                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  An ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, and a sub-optimal inspiratory effort. Allowing for
 changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. Diffuse
 interstitial prominence may relate to bronchovascular crowding in the setting
 of low lung volumes. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Low lung volumes.
