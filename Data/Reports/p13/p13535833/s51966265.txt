                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right empyema status post chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 A right base pleural catheter is noted, there appears to have been advance
 when compared to prior study.  Right lower lobe collapse is persistent.  The
 amount of right pleural effusion is difficult to evaluate, probably unchanged.
 Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right PICC tip is the lower SVC.
