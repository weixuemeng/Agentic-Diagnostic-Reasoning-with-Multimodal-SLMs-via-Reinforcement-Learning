                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent cholangitis status post biliary stent, now with
 right-sided chest and abdominal pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view.  The heart size appears to be mildly enlarged
 with a left ventricular predominance, though assessment is somewhat limited
 due to the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and
 small to moderate on the left.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded.  Partially imaged
 is a percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small to
 moderate on left, with bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis though
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No free air under the diaphragms.
