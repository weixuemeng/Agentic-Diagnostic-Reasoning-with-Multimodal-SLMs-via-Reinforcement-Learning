                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  An ___-year-old male patient with history of hypertension and
 prostate carcinoma who presented with cholangitis and right-sided empyema -
 biliothorax.  Status post chest tube drainage and percutaneous biliary drain,
 reevaluation after recent right empyema.  Evaluate for improvement.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  There is marked improvement of lung
 ventilation with now much improved aeration of the basal segments of the lung.
 The heart size can now be seen to be well within normal limits and no
 configurational abnormality is identified.  The degree of mild elongation and
 widening of the thoracic aorta in this elderly male patient is not excessive
 and no local abnormal aortic bulges can be identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  The left lung base is free with well-delineated
 diaphragmatic contours and absence of any acute infiltrates.  On the right
 base, there is still a pleural density obscuring partially the diaphragmatic
 contour and blunting the lateral and posterior pleural sinus.  A linear
 atelectasis is present on the right base, but again the findings are much
 improved.  The previously existing pigtail and pleural drainage tube has been
 removed, a biliary drainage tube remains unchanged.  On the frontal view,
 there is no evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of previously described pleural and chest wall
 densities.  No cardiac enlargement or pulmonary congestion.  No pneumothorax.
