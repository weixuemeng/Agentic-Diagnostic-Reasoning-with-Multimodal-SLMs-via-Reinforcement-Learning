                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided pigtail pleural catheter has changed in position, with
 a more vertical approach, with tip now terminating closer to the lateral
 aspect of the mid right hemithorax and previously in the medial aspect of the
 right lower hemithorax.  A moderate right pleural effusion has slightly
 changed in distribution, possibly reflecting positional differences between
 the radiographs.  Adjacent atelectasis is again demonstrated in the right
 middle and lower lobes.  Within the left lung, retrocardiac atelectasis has
 slightly worsened, and note is made of a small left pleural effusion.
