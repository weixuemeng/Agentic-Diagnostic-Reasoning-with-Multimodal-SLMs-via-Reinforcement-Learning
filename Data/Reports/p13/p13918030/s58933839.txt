                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal. The aorta is unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen. Contour deformity involving the posterior aspect of the left
 hemidiaphragm on the lateral view could be due to the presence of an
 underlying focal diaphragmatic hernia or eventration. There is no acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Focal contour abnormality of the
 posterior aspect of the left hemidiaphragm possibly be suggestive of a small
 diaphragmatic hernia or eventration. This could be further assessed with chest
 CT on a nonurgent basis, and to exclude an underlying mass.
