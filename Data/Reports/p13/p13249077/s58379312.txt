 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:19 AM
  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  The tip of the replaced OG
  tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view.  This is best seen
  on the edge enhanced view.  Compared with the chest radiograph of earlier on
  the same date, no significant changes.  The remaining support lines and tubes
  are unchanged in position.  Markedly low lung volumes.  The left retrocardiac
  opacity is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema, unchanged.  The right
  cardiophrenic angle is not visualized on the current study and therefore not
  evaluated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypercarbic respiratory failure, OG tube
 replaced  // OG tube placement      OG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Lateral aspect of the right chest and upper abdomen are excluded
 from the examination.  Right lower lobe collapse may have improved.  Right
 middle lobe is still collapsed.  Mild pulmonary edema accompanying moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion has increased.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 presumed, could be moderate on the right, but not large on the left.  Moderate
 to severe enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has improved, could
 be due to volume overload or biventricular cardiac decompensation.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric drainage tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.  Right PIC line can be traced as far as the upper SVC
 but the tip is indistinct.
