 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. 
 Lung volumes remain low, particular on the right.  Assessment of the
 cardiomediastinal contour is consequently limited.  There is prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature, this appears slightly less extensive than on the prior
 study.  Left basilar atelectasis is again noted.  There has been perhaps
 slight interval improvement of the left lower lung.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with mild congestive heart failure.  No significant
 interval change when compared the prior study.
