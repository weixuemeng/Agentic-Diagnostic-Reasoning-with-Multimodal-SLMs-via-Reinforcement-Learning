 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:16 PM
  A right-sided PICC is in unchanged position.  Lung volumes are low which
  accentuates bronchovascular markings.  Compared to the prior radiograph on
  ___, pulmonary edema within the left lung appears improved.  However,
  there is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.
  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and likely collapse of the right lower
  lobe is re- demonstrated.  Superimposed infection involving the right lower
  lobe should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Likely small
  right pleural effusion.
