                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Left base opacity may in part be due
 to an elevated diaphragm, however findings raise concern for pleural effusion
 and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  Mild left
 base atelectasis is seen.  There are left greater than right perihilar
 opacities which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, infectious process
 not excluded.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The right aspect of the
 cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the right base opacity.
