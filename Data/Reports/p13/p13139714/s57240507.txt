                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with reported pleural effusion at an outside hospital
 today.  Assess for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Single portable view of the chest demonstrates elevated right lung base, which
 may be due to right subpulmonic pleural effusion.  No left pleural effusion is
 seen.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is
 normal.  Right cardiac border is not visualized due to elevated lung base.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Multiple
 surgical clips project over left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung base is elevated, suggestive of subpulmonic pleural effusion. 
 Lateral and decubitus views would be helpful in further characterization.
