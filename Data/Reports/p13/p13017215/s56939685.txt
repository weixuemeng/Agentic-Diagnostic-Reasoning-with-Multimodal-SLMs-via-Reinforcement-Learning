                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage with a G-tube placement on
 chronic aspiration, presenting with fever and coffee-ground emesis.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is limited due to rotation of the patient.  Allowing for
 this limitation, there is no focal parenchymal opacity.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A catheter running parallel to the spine along the left
 hemithorax likely represents VP shunt, both ends are out of view.  Another
 catheter underneath the left hemidiaphragm is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
