 HISTORY:  Altered mental status in a patient with recent admission for
 subarachnoid hemorrhage complicated by PEA arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs and normal
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  The left apex cannot be assessed due to
 the head positioning.  A horizontal line projecting over the left lower lung
 likely represents overlying soft tissues.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia or aspiration.
