 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Support and monitoring
 devices are unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis, as well as a
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, no relevant short
 interval changes since the recent study.
