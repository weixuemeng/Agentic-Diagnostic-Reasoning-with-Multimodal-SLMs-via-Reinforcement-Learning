                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoglycemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study is somewhat limited by lordotic positioning.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 similar.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Diaphragms remain
 flattened raising the possibility of COPD.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Chronic blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly on the lateral view may reflect chronic pleural thickening or
 trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 There are mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly may reflect chronic pleural thickening or trace bilateral
 pleural effusions aerated
