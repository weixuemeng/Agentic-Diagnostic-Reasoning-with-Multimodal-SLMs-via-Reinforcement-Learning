 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:13 AM
  Lung volumes are lower.  Confluent opacity involving most of the right mid
  upper hemi thorax is perhaps slightly worsened or overall similar when
  accounting for slight change in lung volume.  Increased perihilar opacity is
  more conspicuous.  A rounded lucency in the upper aspect of this confluent
  opacity in the right upper lung appears overall similar.  This could reflect
  some cavitation within a pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion. 
  The heart is not enlarged.  There is no clear evidence to suggest volume loss
  as the mediastinum is shifted more leftward.
  These findings overall are suggestive of infectious etiology.
