 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HIV, p/w shock multisystem organ failure
 likely ___ pneumonia  // Interval change lobar pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right upper lobe consolidation is unchanged.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema more
 prominent on the right is unchanged.  There is likely a small right pleural
 effusion.  Left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.  Streaky opacities at the
 left base likely atelectasis versus edema however pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 The ET tube is in standard position.  Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid
 SVC.  Enteric tube enters into the stomach and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No change in the right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 Stable asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated.  Streaky opacities at the left
 lung base likely atelectasis versus edema however pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
