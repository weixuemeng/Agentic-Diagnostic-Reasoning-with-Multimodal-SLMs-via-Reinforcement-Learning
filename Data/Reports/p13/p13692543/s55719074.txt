 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube terminating at
 the thoracic inlet.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach where it
 makes a single coil.  There is mild gaseous distention of the stomach.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  The
 lungs appear clear.  The extreme right costophrenic angle is partly excluded
 but there is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.  Orogastric tube terminating
 in the stomach.  No definite evidence for injury.
