                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s.p liver transplant, some fluid overload, now w/
 expectoration of bloody sputum/clots  // Etiology of bloody sputum/clots -
 volume overload/PNA?     Etiology of bloody sputum/clots - volume
 overload/PNA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Left perihilar consolidation worsened substantially between ___ and ___.  It subsequently improved, but now right upper lobe perihilar
 consolidation has worsened.  The explanation for these findings is not
 obvious.  Mediastinal veins  no longer suggest elevated central venous
 pressure or intravascular volume, so I suggest the possibility of recurrent
 aspiration to alternate upper lobes.  Small right pleural effusion is present.
 Right jugular central venous line ends close to the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Heart size is top-normal.  No pneumothorax.  .
