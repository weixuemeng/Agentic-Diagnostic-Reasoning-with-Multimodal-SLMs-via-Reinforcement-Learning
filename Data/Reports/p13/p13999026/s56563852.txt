                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s.p liver transplant, some fluid overload,
 received Lasix diuresis over past 24 hours  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.
 
 Compared 1 day earlier, there is a relatively large area of alveolar opacity
 with air bronchograms in the left upper/mid zone, compatible with focal
 consolidation.  There is sparing of the left lung apex and left base.  No
 left-sided effusion.
 
 Heart size is borderline, probably unchanged.
 
 Again seen is mild patchy opacity at the right base, subtle prominence of
 super right suprahilar markings all and a small right effusion.
 
 Right IJ central line again noted with tip over right upper right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, slightly more
 pronounced on the current study.
 
 Line/drains again noted in the abdomen, similar in configuration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, relatively large, confluent opacity in left upper/mid zone.  The
 appearance is compatible with an area of aspiration or pneumonic
 consolidation.
 
 Faint opacity at the right base and right suprahilar region and small right
 effusion are grossly unchanged.
 
 It is not clear that these findings are related to pulmonary edema and the
 possibility of an infectious infiltrate, particularly in the left lung, should
 be considered.
 
 Right IJ line unchanged, with tip over upper right atrium.
