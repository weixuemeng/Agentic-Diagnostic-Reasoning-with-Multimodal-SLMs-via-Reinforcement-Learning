                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and long-term smoking history.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. Coronary calcification is present. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is vague opacity
 projecting over the left lower lung which is not well localized on the lateral
 view although suspected to reside in the left lower lobe.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Vague streaky opacities in the left lower lung, most likely in the left lower
 lobe, suggesting minor atelectasis. Correlation with clinical presentation is
 suggested regarding the less likely possibility of pneumonia.
