                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever and crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, four views.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is a new patchy posterior
 left lower lobe opacity, highly nonspecific.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are present along the
 mid to lower thoracic spine.  The bones are probably demineralized to some
 degree.  Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New focal left lower lobe opacity; although morphological
 characteristics are somewhat suggestive of atelectasis, pneumonia could also
 be considered.
