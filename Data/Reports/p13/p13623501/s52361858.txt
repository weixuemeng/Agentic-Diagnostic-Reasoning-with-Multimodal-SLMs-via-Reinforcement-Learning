                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and a prior chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rib pain status post frequent falls, assess for rib
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 clear aside from minimal linear density in the left lung base compatible with
 an area of stable scarring.  A smooth pleural indentation along the right
 lower lung is compatible with a known expansile lesion of a right seventh
 lateral rib arch, better assessed on the prior CT.  The mediastinal silhouette
 is normal.  No new bony abnormalities are seen.  Thoracic spine spurs are
 noted anteriorly in the lower thoracic spine.  Cervical spinal hardware is
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change from prior exam.  Stable appearance of expansile right
 seventh lateral rib lesion better assessed on the prior CT chest.
