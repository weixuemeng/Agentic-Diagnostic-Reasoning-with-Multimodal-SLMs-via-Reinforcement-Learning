                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.
 
 Skeletal structures are remarkable for an expansile lucent lesion involving
 the right seventh anterolateral rib with similar appearance to previous chest
 radiograph.  No definite new fracture is evident, but subtle fractures may be
 difficult to detect on conventional chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Expansile right lateral seventh rib lesion is similar in appearance to prior
 radiographs.  Considering clinical suspicion for pathologic fracture,
 dedicated rib radiograph might be helpful to exclude a subtle fracture which
 may not be detectable on conventional chest radiographs.
