 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.

 contours are normal.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No definite fracture is identified in the
 ribs bilaterally. Again seen is the expansile right lateral 7th rib lesion.
 Although this appears slightly more prominent, this could be secondary to
 technique.
