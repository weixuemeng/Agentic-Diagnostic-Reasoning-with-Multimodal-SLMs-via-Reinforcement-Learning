                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer and pleural effusion, now with worsening
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  PET-CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate right pleural effusion is new compared to the most
 recent prior study ___ ___.  There is associated opacification at the
 right lung base, not seen on the prior study.  Chronic atelectasis and
 scarring of the right upper lobe and perihilar opacities radiating from the
 hilum are unchanged.  The left lung remains clear of focal consolidation. 
 Kerley B lines in the left lung base suggests minimal interstitial edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are similar given that the right aspect of the
 heart is obscured by opacity.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New/significantly increased moderate to large right pleural
 effusion from ___ with moderate right basilar
 atelectasis/consolidation. Mild interstitial edema.
