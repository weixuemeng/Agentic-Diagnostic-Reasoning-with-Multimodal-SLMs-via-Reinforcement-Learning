                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion.  // eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior PET CTs, but no prior chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right apical dominant mass seen on prior PET-CT is not well appreciated on
 the chest radiograph. Volume loss in the right upper lobe and scarring is
 noted as well as perihilar opacities that correspond to interlobular septal
 thickening ground-glass opacities and the PET-CT.  There is a moderate right
 pleural effusion, layering as compared to the prior PET-CT, although difficult
 to compare across modalities.  The left lung is clear and there is no left
 pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion.
 
 Scarring and volume loss in the right upper lobe.
 
 Right perihilar fullness corresponds to possible lymphangitic spread of tumor
 on recent PET-CT.
