                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stage IV lung cancer, persistent hypoxia
 and dyspnea, s/p diuresis.  // Evaluate for interval change, particularly in
 degree of pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Port-A-Cath terminates in lower SVC unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved. Moderate partially
 loculated right pleural effusion persist.  Heterogeneous right hilar and upper
 lung opacification consistent with known cancer, slightly increased, likely
 from increased atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improved mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
 
 2.  Persistent heterogeneous right upper lobe opacification and moderate
 partially loculated right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Increased density in the right upper lung zone is probably related to
 atelectasis.
