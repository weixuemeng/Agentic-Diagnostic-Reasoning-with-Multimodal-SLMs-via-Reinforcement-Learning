 As compared to the previous image, both central venous access lines have been
 removed. There is a progression in size and extent of the pre-existing
 right-sided mediastinal lesions, better documented on the CT examination from
 ___.  Also progressive are the predominantly interstitial parenchymal
 changes on the right. A rounded lesion of 3 cm in diameter, located in the
 right lateral lung, is better visible than on the previous image. Finally the
 right pleural effusion has not substantially changed. The left lung is
 unremarkable.
