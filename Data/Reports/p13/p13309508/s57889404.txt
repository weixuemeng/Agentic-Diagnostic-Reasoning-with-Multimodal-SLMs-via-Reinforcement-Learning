 HISTORY:  Pleural biopsy and talc pleurodesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the pulmonary vascular
 congestion appears to have improved.  Small right apical pneumothorax persists
 with a chest tube in place.  The left hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen with
 minimal atelectatic change at the base.  Otherwise, little change.
