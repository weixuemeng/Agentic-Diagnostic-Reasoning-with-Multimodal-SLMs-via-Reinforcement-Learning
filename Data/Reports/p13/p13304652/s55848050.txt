                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with liver failure and new onset fever.  // r/o
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval increase of the heart size as well as vascular congestion. 
 There may be mild interstitial thickening.  Widened vascular pedicle and
 distended azygos vein.  No overt alveolar pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.  No airspace consolidation seen.  No pneumothorax.  Orogastric tube
 projecting over the esophagus and coursing out of picture inferiorly. 
 Spondylotic changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in heart size with vascular congestion suggests fluid
 overload or cardiac decompensation.
 No obvious features to suggest pneumonia, but this cannot be excluded with
 absolute certainty.
