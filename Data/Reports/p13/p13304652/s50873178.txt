                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GI bleed, varices  // Gastric air     
 Gastric air
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are very low lung
 volumes.  Endotracheal tube remains in good position.  The degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion is stable with bibasilar atelectatic changes.  More focal
 opacification, especially at the right base, could suggest developing
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.  The dilatation of the
 gas-filled stomach is not clearly appreciated on the current study.  There is
 no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, though this is not an upright view. 
 If pneumoperitoneum (or intramural air in the wall of the stomach) is a
 serious clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging could be obtained.
