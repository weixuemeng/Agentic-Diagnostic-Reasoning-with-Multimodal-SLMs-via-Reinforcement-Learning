                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with probable cirrhosis and volume overload  // c/f
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is somewhat optimal due to oblique position of the patient. 
 The lung volumes are quite low.  No pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  Increased opacity over the upper abdomen with low lung volumes
 suggest underlying ascites.  Partially imaged right proximal humerus hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema.
