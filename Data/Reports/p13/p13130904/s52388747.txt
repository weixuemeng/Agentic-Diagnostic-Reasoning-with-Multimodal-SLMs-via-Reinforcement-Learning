                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with left lower lobe pneumonia.  This is a
 followup study.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is minimal residual opacity
 at the left lung base, likely atelectasis or scarring, but the left lower lobe
 pneumonia has resolved.  No new opacity is seen. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are
 normal allowing for lung volumes.  Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen. Degenerative change is seen in the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia with minimal residual
 opacity, likely atelectasis or scarring.
