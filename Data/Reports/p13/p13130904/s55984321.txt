  Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation.  Left basilar consolidation is likely
  atelectasis, though pneumonia is difficult to exclude in the proper clinical
  setting.  Could be better evaluate with a PA and lateral if clinically
  indicated. No edema, significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Normal
  cardiomediastinal silhouette.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for free intraperitoneal gas.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are low lung volumes. 
 Opacification at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis, though
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  A lateral view would be helpful.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 The possibility of free air is difficult to assess on this non-upright image. 
 If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
