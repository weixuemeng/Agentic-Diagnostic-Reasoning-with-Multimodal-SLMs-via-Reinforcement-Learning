                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM ___
 
 HISTORY:  SIADH, postop, diagnosis of endometrial cancer.  Now with cough and
 question of lung pathology or other acute process causing cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show clear lungs with no nodules
 or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Tortuosity of the upper trachea
 at the thoracic inlet appears to be related to head positioning.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits in size and shape and no
 suspicious bone abnormality or fracture is seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 fluid is present.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No plain film findings to account for cough.
