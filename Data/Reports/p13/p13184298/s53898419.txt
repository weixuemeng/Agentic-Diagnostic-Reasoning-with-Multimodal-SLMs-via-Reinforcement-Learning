                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a PMHx of EtOH cirrhosis complicated by diuiretic
 refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and esophageal varices on the
 liver transplant list who was transferred from ___ with acute hepatic
 decompensation, renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, and AMS.  // eval
 ETT, PNA, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray 03:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Markedly rotated positioning, which limits assessment. On the current film,
 the ET tube tip appears to lie above the level of the clavicular heads,
 similar to the prior study. Left PICC line and right IJ tube are similar
 prior. An NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film.
 
 There are very low inspiratory volumes, with continued vascular plethora and
 some degree of parenchymal opacity similar to the prior film. No gross
 effusion identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip lies above the level of the clavicular heads, similar to the prior
 film. The assessment of parenchymal findings is limited due to rotation, but
 the overall appearance is similar to the prior film.
