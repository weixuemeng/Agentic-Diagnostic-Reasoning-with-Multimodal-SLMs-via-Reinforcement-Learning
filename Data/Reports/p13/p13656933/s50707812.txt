                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and malaise.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is minimal bilateral lower lung atelectasis as well as mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not
 significantly changed, allowing for differences in technique.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Widespread vertebral body endplate sclerosis is suggestive of a
 metabolic abnormality, statistically renal osteodystrophy.  Cholecystectomy
 clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
 
 3.  Findings compatible with renal osteodystrophy.
