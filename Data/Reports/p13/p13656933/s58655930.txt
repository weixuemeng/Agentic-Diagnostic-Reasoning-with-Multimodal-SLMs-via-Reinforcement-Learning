                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after vascular surgery and
 before second vascular surgery, assessment before surgery.
 
 PA radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is concerning
 for pulmonary hypertension.  There is questionable right lower lung opacity
 that potentially might reflect infectious process versus superimposed soft
 tissues, correlation with lateral view would be beneficial.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
