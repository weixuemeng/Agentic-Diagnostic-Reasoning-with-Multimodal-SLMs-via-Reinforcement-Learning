                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p central line placement  // eval line
 placement, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. 
 Increased opacity at the bilateral bases is noted.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A left-sided
 internal jugular central venous line ends in the upper right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central venous line terminates in the upper right
 atrium.
 2.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Opacity at the right base may represent  aspiration or pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Asymmetrical edema is an additional
 consideration in the setting of mild
  pulmonary vascular congestion.
