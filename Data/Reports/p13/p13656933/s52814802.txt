                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles on exam.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased retrocardiac density is again noted corresponding to left
 lower lobe opacity on the lateral view. It is slightly improved from the
 previous study. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size
 is top normal with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in left lower lobe opacity. 
 
 In the setting of infectious symptoms, this could reflect a developing
 pneumonia. Repeat chest PA and lateral radiograph should be obtained in three
 to four weeks following treatment.
