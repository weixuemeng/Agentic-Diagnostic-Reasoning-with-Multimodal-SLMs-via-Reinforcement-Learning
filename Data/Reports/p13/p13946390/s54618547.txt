                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and dyspnea, diagnosed with
 pneumonia a few days ago, reportedly on the left. 
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs is likely related to vigorous inspiration in this
 young patient.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified. Bilateral
 symmetric 10 mm nodules projecting over the mid-to-lower lungs are likely
 nipple shadows.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, effusion or edema.
