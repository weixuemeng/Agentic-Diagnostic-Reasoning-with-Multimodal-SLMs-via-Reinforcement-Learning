                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with significant cardiac hx, 5 days of unsteadiness 
 // CXR: eval for consolidation;CT head: eval for infarct
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is stable in position.  The patient is status
 post cardiac valve replacement.  Previous seen right mid lung opacity has
 improved in the interval however, there is increased opacity at the right lung
 base, particular the lateral right lung base.  There is blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due to post trace pleural
 effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is grossly stable with the
 cardiac silhouette enlarged but possibly slightly less so as compared to the
 prior study.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to trace pleural
 effusions.  Increased opacity at the lateral right lung base could be due to
 infection or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.  Otherwise, lungs
 remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 
 Persistent cardiomegaly.
