                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  A left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is noted.  The aorta is unfolded. 
 There is no overt pulmonary edema, though there is mild prominence of the
 pulmonary vascular markings with slight cephalization.  Linear opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.
