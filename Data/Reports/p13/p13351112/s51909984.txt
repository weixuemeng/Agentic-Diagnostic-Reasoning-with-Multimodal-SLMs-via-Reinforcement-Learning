 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, chest tightness  // Eval for cardiopulmonary
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted. Patient is rotated to the left. Relative
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again noted. There is blunting of the
 left posterior costophrenic angle suggestive of a small effusion. There is
 possible adjacent atelectasis given retrocardiac opacity noting infection is
 not excluded. Compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine are only
 partially visualized.

 Limited exam. Probable small left-sided effusion. Retrocardiac opacity could
 be due to atelectasis or potentially infection.
