                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DM2, CAD, HTn, afib, CKD, panhypopit, h/o
 DVT, RCC, here for weakness and general fatigue x ___ days.  // Any acute
 processes (pneumonia, pulm edema, change in cardiac silhouette)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar linear opacities likely reflect atelectasis, though a left basilar
 retrocardiac opacity with small air bronchograms may reflect a small
 underlying consolidation, difficult to differentiate from focal atelectasis.
 There is persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  The central pulmonary
 vessels are engorged, without overt edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small retrocardiac opacity at the left base may represent a small
 consolidation, versus focal atelectasis.
