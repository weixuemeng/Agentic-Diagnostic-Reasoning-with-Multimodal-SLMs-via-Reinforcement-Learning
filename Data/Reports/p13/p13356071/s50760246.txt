                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, hypertension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A retrocardiac opacity obscures the
 left hemidiaphragm.  There may be bilateral small pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Cardiomegaly is moderate-to-severe.  Dual-chamber
 pacing leads project over the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent
 infection or volume loss.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.
