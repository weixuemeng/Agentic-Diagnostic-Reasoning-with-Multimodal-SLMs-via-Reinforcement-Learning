                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CAD, low ejection fraction, dyspnea, cough, and question of
 retrocardiac abnormality.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer leads are in standard
 position.  Vascular congestion has resolved.  Bibasilar opacities are a
 combination of moderate bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent
 atelectasis, larger on the left.  These are unchanged from prior studies,
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Right PICC tip is in
 the mid-to-lower SVC.
