                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, CAD.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided transvenous pacemaker is seen with leads in the standard
 position.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Increased opacity at the
 bilateral lung bases most likely represents an increase in bilateral small
 effusions and atelectasis; however, cannot exclude infection.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacity at the bilateral lung bases most likely due to small
 effusions and atelectasis; however, cannot exclude infection.
