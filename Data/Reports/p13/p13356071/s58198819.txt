                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with CHF, COPD and recent pneumonia as well as renal failure
 now getting dialysis who has new leukocytosis, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is been interval placement of a right hemodialysis catheter in the
 internal jugular vein with the tip in the lower SVC.  A right PICC line is in
 unchanged position in the low SVC.  Left transvenous pacemaker with leads in
 the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right are likely related to pleural
 effusion and associated atelectasis and are slightly worse when compared to
 the prior study.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably enlarged.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pneumonia.
 
 2.  Worsening bibasilar opacities, likely related to pleural effusions with
 associated atelectasis.
