                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD, consistent with
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Cardiomegaly is moderate-to-severe.  Left retrocardiac opacity is
 noted, improved since the prior study, most likely reflecting improvement of
 atelectasis or aspiration.  Infectious process is less likely.
