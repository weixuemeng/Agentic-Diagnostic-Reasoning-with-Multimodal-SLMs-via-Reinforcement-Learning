                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease and
 diabetes, status post renal transplant and stent removal on ___
 presenting with two-day history of nausea and fevers, growing gram-negative
 rods in four out of four blood culture bottles and in urine.  Evaluate for
 possible retrocardiac pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding portable single chest examination obtained nine hours earlier
 during the same day.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal
 variation, but no typical configurational abnormalities are identified.  The
 thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  No mediastinal abnormalities are seen.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  No evidence of acute
 parenchymal infiltrates.  Specifically, in response to the posed question,
 there is no evidence of any retrocardiac density.  When comparison is made
 with the preceding portable chest examination, no significant interval change
 can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of advanced CHF or acute infiltrate in this patient
 with apparent clinical evidence of septicemia.
