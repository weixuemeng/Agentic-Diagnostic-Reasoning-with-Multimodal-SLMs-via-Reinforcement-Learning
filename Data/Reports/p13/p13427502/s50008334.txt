 INDICATION:  Status post kidney transplant, sepsis, evaluation of acute
 changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes continue
 to be low.  The diameter of the pulmonary vessels are slightly increasing,
 potentially reflecting mild fluid overload.  Atelectases are seen at both lung
 bases, but no pneumonia is present.  No pleural effusion.  Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
