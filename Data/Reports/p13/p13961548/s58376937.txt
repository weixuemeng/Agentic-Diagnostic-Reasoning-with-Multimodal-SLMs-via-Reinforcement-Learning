                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with epigastric discomfort, n/v, CP, and SOB.  // please eval
 for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new, left greater than right basilar opacities.  The mid and upper
 lung fields are clear.  No definite pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is likely top-normal given AP projection.  Unchanged prominence of
 the right hilum may reflect lymphadenopathy seen on prior cross-sectional
 imaging.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left greater than right basilar opacities are concerning for pneumonia.  Given
 the bilaterality, aspiration is a consideration.
