                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Right
 hilar lymphadenopathy appears similar when compared to the prior studies. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Previously noted right lower lobe
 ill-defined opacity has improved.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
 detected.  There is no acute osseous abnormality including a displaced rib
 fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No displaced rib fracture identified.  If there is continued concern for a
 rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is recommended.  
 
 2. Right hilar lymphadenopathy persists, and differential considerations
 remain broad including inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic etiologies as
 noted on the prior chest CT.  Continued clinical workup and followup is
 recommended if not already in progress.  Previously seen right lower lobe
 patchy opacities have improved.
