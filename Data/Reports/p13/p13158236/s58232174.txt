                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, now
 presenting with acute chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CTA of the
 chest from ___ at 12:59 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Diffuse hazy opacities predominantly
 involving the upper and mid lungs correspond with ground-glass opacities seen
 on concurrent chest CT and are consistent with a history of underlying
 pulmonary sarcoidosis.  More linear fibrosis is noted in the right upper lung.
 No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  The thoracic aorta remains tortuous.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Mild enlargement of the
 bilateral hila are consistent with known lymphadenopathy.  The heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progressive fibrosis due to pulmonary sarcoidosis without
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
