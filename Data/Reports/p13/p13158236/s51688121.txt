                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia, right-sided pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Fullness of the
 mediastinal contour is unchanged, compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy.
 Superior retraction of the hila with diffuse parenchymal opacities,
 architectural distortion and scarring most pronounced in the lung apices are
 all unchanged compared to the previous exams and compatible with sarcoidosis.
 No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No
 pulmonary edema is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively unchanged exam with continued diffuse parenchymal opacities and
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy compatible with sarcoidosis.
