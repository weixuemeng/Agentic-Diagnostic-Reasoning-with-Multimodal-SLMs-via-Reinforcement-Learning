 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary sarcoidosis, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The lung parenchyma and
 the hilar regions show changes typical for sarcoidosis, with multiple
 irregular contours of the mediastinum and the hilar structures as well as
 bilateral nodules in the lung parenchyma.  Perihilar and apical parts of the
 lung parenchyma also show fibrotic changes.  These are documented on a CT
 examination from ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Since the previous examination, no new
 parenchymal opacities have occurred.
