                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain after colonoscopy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Widespread lung opacification is very similar to
 the prior study, allowing for differences in technique and reflects known
 sarcoidosis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The colon appears
 mildly distended at the hepatic flexure, but there is no free air identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable pulmonary abnormalities.  No evidence of free air.
