 INDICATION:  ___M w/recent CABG presenting with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been prior stent graft repair of the aortic arch and proximal
 descending thoracic aorta.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged from the
 prior radiograph.  Opacification of the left lung base is likely a function of
 atelectasis and pleural fluid.  No new focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis
 noting that infection would be difficult to exclude in the proper clinical
 setting.
