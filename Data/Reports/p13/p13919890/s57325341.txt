                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso ___ chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and endovascular stent graft repair
 of the thoracic aorta at the level of the aortic arch due to a saccular
 aneurysm.  Mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  Heart size is mildly
 enlarged though difficult to definitively delineate due to the presence of a
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is also
 unchanged.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged exam compared to 1 day previously with continued moderate left and
 small right pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
