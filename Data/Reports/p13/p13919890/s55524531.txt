                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with palpitation.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS: There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 Prominence of interstitial markings at the bases is likely due to chronic
 interstitial disease as seen on the prior CT chest.  Small nodules within the
 upper lobes are most consistent with granulomas as seen on the prior CT. 
 Rounded density at the left base is most consistent with atelectasis.  The
 heart size is top normal.  There are degenerative changes within the thoracic
 spine but no acute fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic interstitial
 abnormality at the lung bases, similar to the prior CT, which was possibly
 attributable to chronic aspiration or UIP at that time.
