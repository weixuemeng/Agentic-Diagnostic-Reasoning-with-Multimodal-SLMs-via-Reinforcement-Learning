                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, presurgical workup.
 
 Chest, PA and lateral. Please see chest CT dated ___, for more
 complete description of the chest findings.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is marked cardiomegaly.  The aorta is minimally unfolded and
 calcified.  There is prominence of the pulmonary hila, with a tapered
 appearance, which could reflect an element of pulmonary hypertension.  There
 is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is blunting of both
 lateral and posterior costophrenic angles on both sides, reflecting a small
 amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening.  The pulmonary nodules in the right
 and left upper lobe seen on the ___, CT scan are not definitively
 identified radiographically.  There is, however, biapical pleural thickening. 
 
 There is probable diffuse osteopenia, with degenerative changes of both
 shoulders and or the thoracic spine.  There is superior subluxation of the
 left acromion with respect to the distal clavicle suggesting injury/laxity to
 the left AC ligament.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  COPD.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Prominent hila, ? pulmonary hypertension.
 4.  Biapical pleural thickening and minimal bilateral costophrenic angle fluid
 and/or thickening.
 5.  No acute pulmonary process appreciated.
 6.  Probable disruption of the left AC joint ligament.
