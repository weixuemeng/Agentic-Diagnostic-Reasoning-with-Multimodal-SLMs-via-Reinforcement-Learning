                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There is some enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette given this hyperexpansion, though no vascular congestion,
 or pleural effusion.  Apical pleural thickening is seen with mild upward
 retraction of the hila, consistent with old granulomatous disease.  However,
 in no acute focal pneumonia.
