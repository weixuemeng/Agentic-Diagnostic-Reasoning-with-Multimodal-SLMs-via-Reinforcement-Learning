                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxia  // eval for edema or
 infiltrate      eval for edema or infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, and increased bronchovascular crowding may account for
 some of the apparent changes, but I think there is increasing pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild edema, accompanied by increase in moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. No
 pneumothorax.
