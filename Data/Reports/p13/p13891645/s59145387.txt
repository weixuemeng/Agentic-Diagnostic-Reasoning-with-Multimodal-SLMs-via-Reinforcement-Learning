                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Suspected colonic primary malignancy.  Preoperative study.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear.  Moderate degenerative changes involve the right
 shoulder with apparent superior migration of the right humeral head and
 possible narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval.  Small-to-moderate
 osteophytes are noted along the thoracic spine.  Bony demineralization is
 likely.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Suspected bony demineralization.
