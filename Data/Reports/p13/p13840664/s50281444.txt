                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with smoking history.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs,
 consistent with the clinical diagnosis of chronic pulmonary disease.  This is
 also supported by some coarseness of interstitial markings.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggest pleural thickening.
 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is tortuosity of the
 distal aorta.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
