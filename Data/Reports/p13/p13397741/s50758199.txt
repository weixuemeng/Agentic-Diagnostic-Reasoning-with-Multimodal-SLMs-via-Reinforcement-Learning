 HISTORY:  Anemia, congestive heart failure, history of mediastinal mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating within the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No focal consolidation is
 demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist, slightly decreased
 compared to the previous exam.  There is mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vascular interstitium but no overt pulmonary edema demonstrated.  Linear
 opacities within the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, but decreased compared to
 previous exam.  Atelectasis within the right lung base.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.
