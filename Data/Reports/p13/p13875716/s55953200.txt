                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Query infection.  History of melanoma.
 
 COMPARISON-Multiple prior images.Most recent ___ CXR
 
 REPORT:
 
 There are widespread cannonball metastasis, but discrete and confluent
 throughout both lung parenchyma consistent with widespread disease.  Allowing
 for acceptable differences, no definitive evidence of superinfection, although
 this would be difficult to exclude. the findings are suggestive of minimally
 progressive disease, with enlargement suggested for instance in the left
 perihilar area, although any difference does appear relatively minimal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Widespread metastatic disease.
