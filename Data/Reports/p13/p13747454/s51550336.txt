                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post attempted OG placement, assess OG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina. Particularly
 as the head is extended, any further movement centrally could result in
 unilateral intubation.  New orogastric tube terminates just beyond the GE
 junction and could be advanced 7 to 10 cm.  Bilateral chest tubes are
 redemonstrated, without evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 Left subclavian central venous catheter appears to be located in the distal
 subclavian or proximal left brachiocephalic vein.  Left sided arterial line
 terminates in the axilla.  The lungs are low in volume with developing opacity
 in the left upper lobe.  Tortuous and unfolded aorta is noted with
 calcification.  The heart is normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube 2.6cm above the carina should not be advanced any
 further to avoid unilateral intubation.  Orogastric tube could be advanced 7
 to 10 cm as tip is just beyond the GE junction.
 2.  Left subclavian catheter terminates in the distal subclavian or proximal
 left brachiocephalic vein and may no longer be central.  Left axillary
 arterial line terminates in the axilla.  
 3. New left upper lobe opacity could reflect developing pneumonia or an
 aspiration event.
 
 Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on
 ___ by phone. Additional findings were conveyed to Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ by phone at ___ on ___.
