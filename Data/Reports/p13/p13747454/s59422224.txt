                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Poly trauma s/p ex-lap, chest tubes and ETT assess for change. 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Supine portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISONS: Trauma chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: As compared with the prior study, the endotracheal tube is located 3
 cm above the carina in satisfactory position.  There has been interval
 placement of two chest tubes, without appreciable pneumothorax.  There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  Lung volumes are low, without focal consolidation.  Right basal
 atelectasis is appreciated.  Bilateral rib fractures are again demonstrated,
 though poorly assessed due to rotation.  What appears to be a left subclavian
 venous catheter terminates as before at the level of the confluence of
 brachiocephalic veins. What appears to be a left PICC or other small caliber
 catheter terminates at the level of the axilla. Calcified and unfolded
 tortuous aorta is noted.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of bilateral chest tubes without appreciable
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Left subclavian catheter terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein just
 proximal to the confluence. Small bore catheter terminating at the level of
 the left axilla.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on
 ___ by phone.
