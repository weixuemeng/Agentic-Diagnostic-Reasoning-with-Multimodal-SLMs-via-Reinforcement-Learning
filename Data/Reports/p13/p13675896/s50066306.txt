 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent onset of shortness of breath and left chest pain. 
 Increased peak flow, but no wheeze.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared
 parenchymal abnormality in the left lower lobe.  The abnormality parallels the
 posterior aspect of the left major fissure and consists of an area of
 consolidation, with subtle air bronchograms, followed by a more posterior and
 more diffuse parenchymal opacity.  The change would be consistent with a
 non-recent partly resolving infectious process.  The abnormality is better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.
 
 No other changes are visible.  No pleural effusions.  No other parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal contours.
 
 No pleural effusions.
 
 Moderate scoliosis of the thoracic spine, causing asymmetry of the rib cage.
