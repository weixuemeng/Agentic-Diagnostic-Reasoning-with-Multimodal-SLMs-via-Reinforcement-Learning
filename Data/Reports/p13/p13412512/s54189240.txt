                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new pain status post trauma to chest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral views obtained in inspiration, an additional
 PA view of the chest in expiration
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  A small left hydropneumothorax is
 present with accentuation of the pneumothorax component at the apex on the
 expiratory view.  Small right pleural effusion is also noted.  Patchy
 opacities are demonstrated in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis, but
 contusion is not excluded.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Deformity
 of the left sixth lateral rib likely reflects a rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small left hydropneumothorax.
 2. Small right pleural effusion.
 3. Bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, but contusion is not
 excluded.
 4. Left lateral sixth rib fracture.
