 This could represent loculated effusion with possible superimposed parenchymal
 opacity.  There is no large right pleural effusion.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.

 Persistent left basilar opacity compared to prior, potentially a loculated
 effusion although superimposed consolidative process or underlying lesion or
