                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, initial pneumothorax, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:45 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is newly appeared
 slight pleural thickening at the level of the known right rib fractures.  The
 air collection in the soft tissues has slightly decreased.  There is no
 evidence of current pneumothorax.  In unchanged manner, the diameter of the
 vascular structures suggests mild fluid overload.  This is supported by a
 newly occurred subtle left pleural effusion.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
