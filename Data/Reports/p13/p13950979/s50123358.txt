                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with rib fractures, right pneumothorax, new desaturation.
 Lung pathology?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:21 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no visible pneumothorax.  The right chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  The endotracheal tube, the right jugular line and the NG tube are
 stable.  The right lung base is better aerated.  Stability of the left mild
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  Stability of the mild right
 pleural thickening at the base, probably compatible with a hemothorax
 secondary to rib fractures.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Except for a better aeration of the right lung base, there is no significant
 change since the previous exam.
