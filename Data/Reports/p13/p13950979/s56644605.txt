                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ETT and NG placement.  The patient reintubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, at 5:18 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The new ET tube is slightly too high at 8.9 cm above the carina; it could be
 advanced around 3 cm.  Right-sided jugular line ends in the mid SVC and NG
 tube is in adequate position.  Right chest tube is possibly fissural, but
 there is no pneumothorax.  Left lower lobe collapse with mild pleural effusion
 is stable.  Small right pleural effusion and mild lower lobe atelectasis is
 new.  Multiple right rib fractures and right clavicle fracture are unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contour are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New endotracheal tube should be advanced 3 cm.
 2.  The right chest tube is possibly fissural; but there is no pneumothorax.
 3.  New, small, right pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis.
