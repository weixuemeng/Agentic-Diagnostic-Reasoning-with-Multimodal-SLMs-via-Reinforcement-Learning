                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pacemaker and now SOB/CP  // R/O CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft. Median sternotomy wires
 appear grossly intact. There is a prosthetic mitral valve in place.  The left
 chest wall pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 There is new dense opacity at the left base obscuring the hemidiaphragm and
 apparently contiguous with the pleural surface, likely loculated pleural
 effusion, however underlying pneumonia or mass cannot be excluded. There is
 atelectasis at the right base. Remaining lung fields are relatively clear.
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes but likely
 unchanged. The mediastinal and contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
 There is no frank pulmonary edema. Multiple old healed right lateral rib
 fractures are again identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dense opacity at the left base likely reflects pleural effusion, in part
 loculated, however underlying consolidation/ pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly is likely stable. There is no frank pulmonary edema.
