 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with flail chest and respiratory compromise.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina in standard position.  A
 right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  The NG tube is also in good position.
 The right chest tube could be fissural.  There is no visible pneumothorax. 
 The left lower lobe collapse and mild-to-moderate pleural effusion are stable.
 Less severe right base atelectasis has improved.  Small pleural or
 extrapleural hematoma along right rib fractures and displacement of the right
 clavicle fracture are unchanged.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Stable left lower lobe collapse and moderate pleural effusion.
 2.  Right chest tube may be fissural; no visible pneumothorax.
 3.  Improving, moderate, right basal atelectasis.
