                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent intubation.  Evaluate for location
 of chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution performed one hour
 prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiographs were performed before and after the relocation of
 the endotracheal tube.  The endotracheal tube is seen ending at the level of
 the carina in the first radiograph but after withdrawal its final placement is
 approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Otherwise, the lung volumes are low
 accounting for bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar parenchymal streaky
 opacities are seen and appear more conspicuous than in prior.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 The perimediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Final position of the endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes with new bibasilar opacities which may represent
 atelectasis versus aspiration.
