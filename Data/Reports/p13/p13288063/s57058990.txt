  1. Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the orifice of the right mainstem
  bronchus and should be withdrawn by approximately 3-4 cm. This was discussed
  with Dr.___ at 22:25, ___ by telephone.
  2. Orogastric tube tip within the stomach.
  3. Widened superior mediastinum is due to mediastinal lipomatosis as noted on
  the previous CT.
  4. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, likely
  atelectasis though infection in the left lower lobe is not excluded.
  5. Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:14 and chest CT ___ at 14:54.  Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates at the right mainstem bronchial orifice.  An
 orogastric tube tip is within the stomach. Cardiac silhouette size is severely
 enlarged. Mediastinum is widened superiorly which is compatible with
 lipomatosis as seen on the previous CT. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more
 pronounced on the left, likely reflect areas of atelectasis as seen on the
 previous CT, though infection in the left lower lobe is not completely
 excluded. There are no large pleural effusions with mild lateral pleural
 thickening bilaterally secondary to fat. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 may be present. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the orifice of the right mainstem
 bronchus and should be withdrawn by approximately 3-4 cm. This was discussed
 with Dr.___ at 22:25, ___ by telephone.
 2. Orogastric tube tip within the stomach.
 3. Widened superior mediastinum is due to mediastinal lipomatosis as noted on
 the previous CT.
 4. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, likely
 atelectasis though infection in the left lower lobe is not excluded.
 5. Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
