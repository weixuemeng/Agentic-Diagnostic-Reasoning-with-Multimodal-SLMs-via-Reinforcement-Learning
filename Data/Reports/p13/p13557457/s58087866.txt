                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, history of CABG.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes.  Relative
 opacity over the left lung base may be due to overlying soft tissue, although
 underlying atelectasis or pleural effusion is not excluded.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is relatively obscured.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, which
 may in part relate to epicardial fat pad.  A tubular structure projects over
 the right upper abdomen.  The stomach contains a large air-fluid level. 
 Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine.
