                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new dual chamber PPM.  Evaluate for lead
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker is again seen, with leads unchanged position compared to
 prior.  The ventricular tip most likely abuts the right ventricular wall.Heart
 size is upper limits of normal.Mediastinal and hilar contours are mildly
 enlarged, with apical redistribution of the pulmonary vessels and bilateral
 small to moderate pleural effusion, likely due to pulmonary edema.  Right lung
 linear opacities are likely due to atelectasis.  There is no evidence for
 pulmonary consolidation or pneumothorax. Aortic calcification appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left-sided pacemaker with leads in expected location.
 2. Pulmonary edema and bilateral small to moderate pleural effusion.
