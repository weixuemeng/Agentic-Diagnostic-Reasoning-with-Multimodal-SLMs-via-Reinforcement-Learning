                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachycardic, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as result of low lung volumes
 appearing mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities are noted in both lung bases, more pronounced on the right.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on
 the right, likely reflective of atelectasis.
