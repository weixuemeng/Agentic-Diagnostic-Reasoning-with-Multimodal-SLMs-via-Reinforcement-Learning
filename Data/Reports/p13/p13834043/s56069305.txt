                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB  // infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low. There is a
 retrocardiac opacity containing air-fluid level consistent with a large hiatal
 hernia as seen on prior.  There is mild streaky left basal opacity abutting
 the hiatal hernia, which could represent atelectasis versus an early
 pneumonia/aspiration.  Right lung is clear.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Scoliotic deformity of the lumbar spine is partially
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity abutting the hiatal hernia, question atelectasis
 versus early pneumonia/aspiration.
