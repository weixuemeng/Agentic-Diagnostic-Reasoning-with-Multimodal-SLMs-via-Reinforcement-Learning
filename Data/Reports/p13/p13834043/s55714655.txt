                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ILI  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Probable left retrocardiac airspace opacity is noted.  Left basilar
 atelectasis is present.  No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild
 pulmonary edema may be present, though difficult to evaluate given the patient
 body habitus.  Moderate cardiomegaly is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and limited examination secondary to patient body
 habitus.  Within this limitation, a left retrocardiac airspace opacity may
 represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly and likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion/edema.
