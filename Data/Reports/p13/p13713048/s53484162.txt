                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left shoulder film showing possible pleural
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest dated ___ and shoulder radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Hilar prominence is likely secondary to
 crowding.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given the limitations
 of low lung volumes.  A prominent epicardial fat pad is noted
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pleural effusion.  The epicardial fat pad accounts for the
 blunting noted on the accompanying shoulder radiographs.
