                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at an earlier time.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is mildly enlarged and associated with vascular engorgement
 and overall worsening of bilateral juxtahilar pulmonary opacities,
 particularly on the left.  This is likely due to pulmonary edema, but
 coexisting secondary process such as infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting, particularly given the somewhat nodular quality
 of opacities in the right lung.
