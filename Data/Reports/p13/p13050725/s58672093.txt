                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent intubation  // ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 15:50.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now intubated. The tip
 of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carinal. No pneumothorax.
 The lung volumes have increased. As a consequence, the pre-existing bilateral
 parenchymal opacities have slightly decreased in extent and severity but are
 still clearly present, with little overall change.
