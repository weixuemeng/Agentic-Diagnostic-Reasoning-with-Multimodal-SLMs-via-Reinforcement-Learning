                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemic resp failure, recently extubated
 // Eval for pulm edema, consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, 08:36.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large areas of abnormality have been present in both lungs since ___. 
 However the distribution, severity, and morphology have changed.  The
 variability suggests a large component of edema, but concurrent pneumonia is
 certainly possible. Today the left lower lobe which cleared between ___ is still clear while the upper lobe is more it densely consolidated today
 than it was on ___. More typically appearing pulmonary edema, in the right
 lung is moderately severe, and has improved since ___.
 
 Pleural effusions are small if any. Heart size is normal. A dilated ascending
 thoracic aorta accounts for the convex lateral sweep to the mediastinum in the
 region. In ___, the caliber of the ascending thoracic aorta the was between
 ___ and 42 mm. Based on comparison with the concurrent chest radiograph, ___, the aorta may be more dilated today.
 
 Right PIC line ends at a level least 6.5 cm below the carina and would need to
 be withdrawn 2.5 cm to reposition with confidence in the low SVC, if desired.
