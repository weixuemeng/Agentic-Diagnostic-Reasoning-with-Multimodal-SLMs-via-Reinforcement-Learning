                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Behcet's disease, now likely PCP. Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Direct comparison to the prior film is limited by motion on the earlier film
 and significant differences in technique.  Allowing for this, the overall
 appearance is quite similar, with possible slight improvement in the more
 confluent opacity in the right upper zone.  Overall, the appearance is
 essentially unchanged.  
 
 Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the right atrium and could be
 retracted by 4.5 to 5.5 cm to lie in the distal SVC.  Cerclage wires overlie
 the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for technical differences, the overall appearance is
 quite similar.  Equivocal slight improvement.
