 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of vasculitis on prednisone
 and methotrexate with increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ along with chest CTA from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new focal opacity in the right lower lobe with a few
 air-bronchograms. Otherwise, the remainder of the lungs are without
 consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.  The previously visualized left
 upper and left lower lobe nodules are not visualized on today's study and
 better delineated on prior CT from ___.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains stable.  Visualized osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is a new focal opacity in the right lower lobe with a few
 air-bronchograms consistent with a developing right lower lobe pneumonia.
