                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Bechet's disease and PCP vs bacterial
 pneumonia  // Please eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 10:37.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study and allowing for apparent blurring due to motion
 on today's study, there is somewhat more confluent opacity through much of the
 right lung, suggesting the presence of an alveolar component. Possible small
 confluent areas scattered in the left lung. No effusion is identified.
 Bilateral background interstitial changes are similar to the prior film. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with prominence of the ascending
 and descending aorta. No pneumothorax is detected. Cerclage wire can clips
 seen over the lower neck.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More confluent alveolar opacities apparent on today's exam, allowing for
 blurring due to motion. In the proper clinical setting, this could reflect
 progressive CHF, now with alveolar edema. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 pneumonic infiltrates, hemorrhage, and ARDS could have a similar appearance.
 Clinical correlation is therefore requested.
