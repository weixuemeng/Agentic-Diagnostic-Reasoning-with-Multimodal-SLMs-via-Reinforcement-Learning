                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  A moderate-sized hiatal
 hernia is again noted.  Increased interstitial opacities are noted diffusely,
 more pronounced on the lung bases, likely reflective of chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  Mild superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema is not excluded.
 More focal opacity within the right upper lobe could reflect an area of
 infection.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffusely increased interstitial opacities likely reflective of chronic
 interstitial lung disease, though a component of superimposed interstitial
 pulmonary edema is not excluded.  More focal patchy opacity in the right upper
 lobe could suggest infection.  Moderate size hiatal hernia.
 
 Comparison with any previous chest CT imaging is recommended, and if none are
 available, dedicated high-resolution chest CT is suggested.
