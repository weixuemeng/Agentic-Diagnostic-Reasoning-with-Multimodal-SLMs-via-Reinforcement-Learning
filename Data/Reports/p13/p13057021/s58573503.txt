                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right hydropneumothorax // eval chest tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with tip
 terminating near the apex with interval decrease in the amount of fluid in the
 right pleural space and improved aeration of the right lung.  There is a
 persistent moderate right hydropneumothorax noted with fluid loculated
 laterally.  There is continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures, not
 substantially changed.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect
 worsening atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion.  No left-sided
 pneumothorax is present.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right apical chest tube with decreased size of the
 right hydropneumothorax and improved aeration of the right lung.  There is
 still a residual moderate size right hydropneumothorax.  Continued small left
 pleural effusion with patchy atelectasis in the left lung base, slightly worse
 in the interval.
