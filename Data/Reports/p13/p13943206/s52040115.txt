                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with stage IIIA adenocarcinoma status post VATS
 right lower lobectomy and right chest tube removal.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion persists with concurrent consolidation.  Trace
 left pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess in the setting of adjacent pleural effusion and right
 basilar opacification.  Lung volumes are low with prominent pulmonary
 vasculature without frank edema.  Hilar surgical clips reflect recent
 lobectomy.  Right apical, anterior and posterior air-fluids level likely
 represents post-operative loculations. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right air-fluid loculations and persistent moderate right pleural effusion.
