                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post VATS of the right lower lobe, in need
 of interval assessment.  Right lower lobectomy has also been performed.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is large, but stable compared to prior exam.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Again is seen a
 moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  A
 locule of gas is trapped within the lower posterior aspect of the right
 pleural space.  This has not changed since prior exam.  Pleural fluid tracks
 up laterally into the apical portion of the pleural space, but the previously
 seen right apical pneumothorax has resolved.  A new small-to-moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis has arisen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with stable right hydropneumothorax and new left
 pleural effusion.
