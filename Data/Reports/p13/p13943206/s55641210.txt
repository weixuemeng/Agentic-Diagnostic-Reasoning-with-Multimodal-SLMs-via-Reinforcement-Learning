                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left-sided shoulder and chest pain.  History
 of adenocarcinoma.  Status post VATS with right lower lobectomy and
 chemoradiation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is increased perihilar opacity
 when compared to prior.  This could potentially be posttreatment changes
 noting that underlying mass lesion or infection cannot be excluded.  Right
 pleural thickening is seen circumferentially.  Increased opacity projecting
 over the lower lobes on the lateral could be due to pleural fluid or
 thickening although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The left lung
 is clear.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased density in the right hilum potentially related to post treatment
 changes noting that superimposed infection or progression of disease is not
 excluded.  No other change.
