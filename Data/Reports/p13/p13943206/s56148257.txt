                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with stage IIIA adenocarcinoma status post VATS
 right lower lobectomy and right chest tube removal, now with tachypnea and
 decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the patient in
 a semi upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at approximately 11:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval removal of a right chest tube.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion and right basilar consolidation persist with slightly increased
 aeration at the right lung base.  Small left pleural effusion is seen.  In
 retrospect, a small right apical pneumothorax is seen, which appears unchanged
 compared to prior.  Right hilar surgical clips reflect recent lobectomy.   
 Subcutaneous emphysema is again seen
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax and slightly improved aeration at the right
 lung base with persistent moderate right pleural effusion.
