                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Melanoma, to assess for disease status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Specifically, no parenchymal or
 skeletal metastasis.  The lucency overlying the right chest wall is less
 prominent, most likely external to the patient.
