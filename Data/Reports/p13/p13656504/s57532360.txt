                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated
 compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Given the associated symptoms of fever,
 the possibility of a subtle underlying pneumonia is difficult to exclude. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  Heart size is poorly assessed. 
 Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions with associated compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis, pneumonia not able to be excluded.
