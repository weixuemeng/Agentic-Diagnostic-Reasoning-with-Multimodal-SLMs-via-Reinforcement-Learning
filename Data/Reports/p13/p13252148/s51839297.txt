                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased WOB, COPD   decreased BS on left 
 // eval for volume overload, PNA, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Worsening heterogeneous
 lower lung opacities could potentially represent dependent edema in the
 setting of upper lobe predominant emphysema, but aspiration or developing
 aspiration pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Small left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
