                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Current smoker with mild hypoxia, history of COPD and
 erythrocytosis
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Pulmonary arteries are
 enlarged, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities are noted throughout the lungs, increased since the
 prior study.  Differential diagnosis would include mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema versus interstitial lung disease (less likely).  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No definitive focal mass is noted.  Given the findings
 and patient's history, correlation with chest CT might be considered.  
 
 Additionally, there is slight narrowing of the upper trachea and mild
 deviation to the left that might be consistent with right thyroid enlargement
 but also can be assessed on the chest CT.
