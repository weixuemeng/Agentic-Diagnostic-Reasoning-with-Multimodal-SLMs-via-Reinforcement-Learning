                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question infiltrate, edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:32 p.m.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for technical differences:  There
 is upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora and diffuse vascular blurring,
 suggesting CHF, which appears more pronounced than on the prior study.  Again
 seen is patchy opacity at the left base, with some blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study.  There is also some patchy
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, which even allowing for technical
 differences, may be slightly more pronounced.  The extreme right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the film.  No gross right effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Vascular plethora and vascular blurring/increased interstitial markings
 suggestive of CHF with interstitial edema.
 
 2) Bibasilar patchy opacities.  The differential diagnosis includes infectious
 infiltrate, areas of aspiration or other inflammatory infiltrates.
 
 3) Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, the CHF
 findings have progressed.  The right base opacity may also be slightly more
 pronounced.
