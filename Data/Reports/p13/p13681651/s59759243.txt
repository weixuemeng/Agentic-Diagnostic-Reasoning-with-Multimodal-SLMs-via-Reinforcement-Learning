                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Smoker with abnormal chest x-ray, asymptomatic.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Very mild
 interstitial abnormality that predominates in the periphery of the lower lobes
 is unchanged.  There is no evidence of masses, consolidations or pleural
 effusions.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interstitial abnormality.  This could be due to emphysema
 or interstitial lung disease.  This is stable from prior study.  No suspicious
 lung abnormalities.
