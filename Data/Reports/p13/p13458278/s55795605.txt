 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 3.6 cm linear radiopaque structure projecting over the soft tissue of the left
 neck on the frontal view, not well evaluated on the lateral view, may be
 external to the patient.  Please correlate clinically.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  3.6 cm linear radiopaque structure projecting over the soft tissue of the
 left lateral neck, unclear whether external to the patient.  Please correlate
 with direct visualization.
