                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with known right lower lobe infiltrate, not
 better after three days of antibiotics.  Evaluation for right lower lobe
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  The previous x-ray demonstrating alleged right lower lobe infiltrate is
 not available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lungs are
 mildly hyperinflated and there is a lower position of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms, which can be seen in the setting of emphysema.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine and there may be some
 anterior wedge deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.  No evidence of pneumonia. 
 Mild hyperinflation of the lungs with relative flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms suggestive of emphysema.
