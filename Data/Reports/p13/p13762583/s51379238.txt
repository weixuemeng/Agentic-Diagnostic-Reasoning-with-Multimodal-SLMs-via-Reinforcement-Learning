                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, oxygen sats mid 90s
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 architectural distortion, superior bilateral hilar retraction, traction
 bronchiectasis, nodularity and fibrosis involving both upper lobes.  No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No
 pulmonary edema is detected, though there may be mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perhaps mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Otherwise, chronic changes in the
 upper lobes which may be due to sarcoidosis or chronic granulomatous disease.
