                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, elevated lactate, and tachycardia. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  A streaky opacity
 at the left base is likely atelectasis.  There is no large focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart
 size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar atelectasis.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
