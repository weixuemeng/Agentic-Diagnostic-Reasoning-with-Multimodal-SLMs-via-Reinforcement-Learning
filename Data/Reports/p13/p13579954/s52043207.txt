                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with diffuse rhonchi, bilateral opacities on chest
 x-rays, aspiration pneumonitis versus atelectasis vs pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right lower lung opacities are stable, but left lower lung consolidation
 has increased with new small pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Right basal consolidation is stable, but left lower lung consolidation has
 increased with new small pleural effusion.  This could be due to aspiration,
 pneumonia or atelectasis.
