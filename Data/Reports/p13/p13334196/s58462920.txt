                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with pain.  Assess for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated and clear.  Stable mild blunting of
 bilateral costophrenic angles are most consistent with scarring.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable without displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mildly hyperinflated lungs can be seen in the setting of COPD and small
 airways disease.
 
 2. No displaced rib fracture.  If persistent concern consider dedicated rib
 series for further evaluation.
