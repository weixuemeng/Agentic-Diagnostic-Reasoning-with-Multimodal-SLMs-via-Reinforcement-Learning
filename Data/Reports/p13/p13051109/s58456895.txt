                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, weakness  // ? pneumonia or other acute
 cardiopulm proces
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears top normal.  The aorta remains tortuous with diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy linear opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
