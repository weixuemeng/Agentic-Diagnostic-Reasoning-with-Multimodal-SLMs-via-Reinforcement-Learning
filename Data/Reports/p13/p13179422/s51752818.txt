                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with effusion status post
 thoracocentesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational abnormalities are
 identified.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present.  Right-sided diaphragm is mildly elevated and there
 appear local pleural scar formations in the most lateral pleural sinus, but
 there is no evidence of significant pleural effusion as the posterior pleural
 sinuses are free bilaterally.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area
 on the frontal view.  Comparison is made with the next preceding study ___ ___, at that time existing small amounts of bilateral pleural effusions
 have disappeared.  No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen, nor is
 there evidence of any hilar adenopathy or mediastinal widening.  In comparison
 on previous examination identified deformity of the seventh right rib in its
 posterior lateral area remains but structural appearance is rather normal.
 Similar as on previous examination, a surgical clip is overlying the left
 upper posterior abdominal quadrant? status post splenectomy?
 
 No evidence of new acute pulmonary abnormalities and no pneumothorax.  The
 next preceding FDG tumor imaging PET scan of ___ identified new
 lesions in the superior mediastinum escaped identification by routine PA and
 lateral chest.  Recommend followup chest CT if further detail is required.
