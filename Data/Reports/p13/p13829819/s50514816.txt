                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with substernal chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.
 
 There is minimal increased right basilar opacity, potentially due to
 atelectasis given relatively lower lung volumes.  Left lung remains clear. 
 Lateral costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
 as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased right basilar opacity, potentially due to
 atelectasis; however, PA and lateral may offer additional detail if desired. 
 Otherwise, unremarkable portable chest x-ray.
