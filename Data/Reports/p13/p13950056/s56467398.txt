                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Prolonged intubation and airway edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
 improvement in the extent of pulmonary edema with stable small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  The azygos vein and mediastinal vessels remain engorged,
 consistent with persistent hypervolemia.  The lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates no less than 5 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly out of field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decompensated congestive heart failure with interval improvement
 in pulmonary edema, but persistent bilateral pleural effusions and
 hypervolemia.
