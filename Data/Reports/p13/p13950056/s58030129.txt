                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Airway edema and prolonged intubation.  Assessment of
 OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:57 p.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 7 cm above the carina.  NG tube passes below
 the diaphragm, with its tip most likely terminating in the proximal stomach. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Extensive pulmonary
 edema and bilateral pleural effusions appear to be progressed as compared to
 prior examination obtained the same day earlier.
