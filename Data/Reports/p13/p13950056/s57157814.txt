                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and pneumonia, status post intubation with laryngeal edema
 and swelling.  Now with hypoxia and possible aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 5 cm
 above the level of the carina.  An enteric catheter courses below the level of
 the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  Lung volumes remain
 low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  Consolidative bibasilar opacities are not significantly changed,
 likely some combination of atelectasis, pleural effusions, and infection. 
 There is pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is top normal, as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change in bibasilar consolidative opacities,
 likely some combination of atelectasis, pleural effusions, and infection.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial pulmonary edema.
