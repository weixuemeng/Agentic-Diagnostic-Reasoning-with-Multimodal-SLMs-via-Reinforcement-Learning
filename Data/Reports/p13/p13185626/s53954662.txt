                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bacteriemia.  PICC line on arrival.  PICC line placement
 confirmation requested.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A PICC line terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  A nasogastric tube
 courses across the mediastinum although the hemidiaphragms are barely included
 so the distal course is not assessed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 findings are consistent with mild vascular congestion but not as severe as ten
 days earlier.  Sequela of septic right shoulder appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line terminating in the upper superior vena cava.
