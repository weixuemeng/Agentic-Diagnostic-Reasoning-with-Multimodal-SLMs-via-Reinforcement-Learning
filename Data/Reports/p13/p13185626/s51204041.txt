 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___ h.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, the opacification of most the left hemithorax is unchanged

 aerated left upper lung is overall unchanged. An underlying left pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded. The appearance of the right hemithorax is overall
 unchanged.  Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax in a semi-upright film,
 suggestive of a layering right pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema, focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia, or pneumothorax. No change in the position
 of the ETT tube, NG tube, and right PICC line.
