 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Upper gastrointestinal bleed, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been removed.  The lung volumes are slightly lower than on the previous image,
 with bilateral areas of basal atelectasis.  There is minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a minimal pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
