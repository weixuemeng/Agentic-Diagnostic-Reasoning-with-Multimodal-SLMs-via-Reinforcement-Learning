                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year old male with lethargy.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The
 curvilinear opacity in the right lung base most probably reflects an area of
 band-like atelectasis as opposed to subdiaphragmatic air within the
 diaphragmatic eventration.  However, clinical correlation would be recommended
 to assess for surgical abdomen.  A prominent gastric bubble and prominent
 colonic contents are seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Curvilinear opacity in the right lung base, most likely
 represents an area of plate-like atelectasis and less likely subdiaphragmatic
 free air within diaphragmatic eventration; either way, attention on abdominal
 exam is recommended, and if clinical concern for surgical abdomen exists,
 abdominal CT may be considered.  These findings were discussed with, ___
 ___, at 10:36 a.m. on ___ by ___ over the phone.
