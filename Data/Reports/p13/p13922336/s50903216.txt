                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post pacemaker placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval placement of a left pectoral pacemaker with a single
 ventricular lead terminating in appropriate position in the right ventricle. 
 Mild cardiomegaly, mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged
 from ___.  Lung volumes are low with associated bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Significant
 dilatation of the colon is incompletely imaged and may be representative of
 ileus. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of left pectoral pacemaker with lead terminating in
 right ventricle without complication.
 
 2. Dilatation of the colon is incompletely imaged and may be suggestive of
 ileus or other obstructive process.
