                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent cough and wheeze.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  With the apices, the previously
 seen area of scarring and nodularity is again redemonstrated, better
 appreciated on the chest CT obtained previously.  No evidence of acute
 infection is currently seen within the limitations of this study technique.
