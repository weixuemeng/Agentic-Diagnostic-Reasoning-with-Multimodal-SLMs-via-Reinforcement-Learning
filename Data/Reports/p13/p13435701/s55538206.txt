 HISTORY:  Increased lower extremity edema history CHF.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable right pleural
 effusion and consolidation at the right lung base, likely atelectasis,
 although underlying infection cannot be excluded.  The heart size is enlarged
 and is unchanged.  The right diaphragmatic surface is not well seen, secondary
 to the pleural effusion on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable right pleural effusion and right lung base consolidation,
 likely atelectasis, however an underlying infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
