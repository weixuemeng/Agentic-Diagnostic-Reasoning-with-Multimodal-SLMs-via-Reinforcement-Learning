                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia compared to ___, for improvement
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.  Chest
 CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged since prior exam.  Left
 moderate pleural effusion has significantly improved.  There is only residual
 minimal bilateral pleural effusion.  In aerated portion of the lung, there is
 no pneumonia.  Right middle lobe atelectatic band is new.  Cardiac silhouette
 looks bigger due to low lung volumes and known hiatal hernia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends in lower SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged.
 
 2.  Improvement of left pleural effusion with residual minimal bilateral
 pleural effusion.
 
 3.  In aerated portion of the lung, there is no pneumonia.
