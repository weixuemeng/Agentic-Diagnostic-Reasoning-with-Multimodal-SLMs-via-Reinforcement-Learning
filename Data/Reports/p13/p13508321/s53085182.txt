 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in
 position.  Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the left supraclavicular
 region.  Persistent but improved atelectasis is noted at the left lung base
 compared to ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The patient is slightly rotated which

 silhouette is probably unchanged.  A massive hiatal hernia is again noted and
 unchanged.  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is detected.
