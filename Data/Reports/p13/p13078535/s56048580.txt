                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE ___ AT 6:21
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fevers, altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to previous study dated ___ at 22:00.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 6:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  Right internal
 jugular central line is unchanged in position.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There are stable
 small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with some associated
 patchy airspace process, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.  When
 compared to the prior study, there has been slight interval improvement in
 aeration in both lungs.
