                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 22:00
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 20:50.
 
 Portable supine chest film, ___ at 10:00 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central
 line are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is
 not visualized on the current study.  There are layering bilateral effusions
 with patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, most likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Low volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged given differences in positioning and technique.  No
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.
