 AP CHEST 5:30 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure, sepsis and fluid
 overload.  New PICC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Tip of the new left PICC line projects over the low SVC.  No mediastinal
 widening has occurred following removal of previous right IJ central venous
 catheter.  Lung volumes are low, continually.  Right lower lobe consolidation
 she developed after ___ has been relatively constant, but not
 worsening.  I suspect pneumonia, but there is also the possibility of a
 posteriorly layering pleural effusion simulating lung pathology.  In the left
 lower lobe is persistent atelectasis.  Upper lungs are clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard position, upper enteric drainage tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  Heart is normal size.
