 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:04 AM
  Following attempted left-sided central venous line attempt, no left-sided
  pneumothorax evident.  However on the right there is a suggestion of a pleural
  line possibly indicating a small pneumothorax, this is difficult to separate
  from the superimposed scapular shadow.   Otherwise unchanged exam.  Recommend
  repeat radiograph.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent central line attempt, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Superimposition of the right scapula limits
 the evaluation for a small right pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes. 
 There is increasing vascular congestion.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 standard positions.
