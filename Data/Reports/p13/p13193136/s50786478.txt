                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of AFib/AT, status post
 cardioversion, now with mild shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided pacer is present with
 leads ending in the expected location of the right atrium and ventricle,
 unchanged.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms
 consistent with COPD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Small rounded density at the right lung base posteriorly, best
 seen on the lateral view, is consistent with a small Bochdalek hernia as seen
 on the prior cardiac MRI.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD.  No acute intrathoracic process.
