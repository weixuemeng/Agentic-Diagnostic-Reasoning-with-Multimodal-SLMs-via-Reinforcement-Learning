                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, on amiodarone.  History
 of COPD.  Evaluate possible amiodarone toxicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through
 ___:
 
 Lungs are moderately hyperinflated but clear.  There are no findings of
 pulmonary toxicity.  Heart is top normal size but pulmonary and mediastinal
 vascular caliber is normal and there is no edema or pleural effusion. 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses from the left axillary pacemaker.  Rightward displacement of
 the trachea in the neck has been present since at least ___ and may reflect
 enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid gland, as such potentially
 contributing to atrial fibrillation.  A sclerosis in the fourth rib laterally
 has been present since ___ and has progressed to the anterior portion of that
 rib.  The explanation for this is not obvious either radiographically or from
 reading the medical record.  The first step is to determine if there is any
 focal tenderness.
