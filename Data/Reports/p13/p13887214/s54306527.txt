                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is basilar predominant septal
 thickening, hilar engorgement, and cardiomegaly, findings consistent with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Probable bilateral pleural effusions are small.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Apparent upper mediastinal widening may be due to
 engorged venous vasculature.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with probable bilateral small pleural
 effusions.  Recommend follow-up radiographs after treatment to assess for
 interval improvement in basilar opacities and mediastinal contours.
