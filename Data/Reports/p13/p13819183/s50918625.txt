 WET READ: ___ ___ ___:___ PM
  Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe, more pronounced as compared to prior
  chest radiograph, minimally obscuring the medial right hemidiaphragm appears
  to correspond to atelectasis on the lateral view.  However, an early
  infectious process is difficult to exclude and clinical correlation is
  advised.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  The
  findings were discussed with Dr. ___, ___D. by ___, ___D. on
  the telephone on ___ at 5:___ PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man hx diabetes and myopericarditis with poor air
 movement in lung fields with congestion. Patient is deaf, pager ___ for ASL
 if available  // ? pneumonia vs. edema vs. acetlectsis     ? pneumonia vs.
 edema vs. acetlectsis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs in ___.
 
 Greater lung density at the lung bases could be due to overlying soft tissue,
 since there is no corresponding abnormality on the lateral view.  However
 oblique views would be very helpful in getting a second look at the lower
 lungs in order to assess any pneumonia.
 
 Lung volumes are not hyperinflated.  There is no pulmonary edema pleural
 effusion.  Top-normal heart size is stable.
 
 The aortic knob is obscured and the mediastinum above that level mildly
 widened, though unchanged since ___.  In diabetic that, one thinks of
 mediastinal fat deposition, however there is slight rightward deviation of the
 trachea, findings that could be due to an enlarged thyroid.  Clinical
 correlation advised.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Oblique chest radiographs.
 
 Clinical evaluation of the left neck for enlarged thyroid.
