                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness after the fall.  History of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mild unfolding is noted along the
 thoracic aorta.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Vague peripheral reticulation in each lower lung is suggestive
 of mild interstitial lung disease, which is most likely chronic.  No prior
 comparison is available.  Elsewhere, the lung fields appear clear.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  Findings suggesting interstitial lung
 disease, but without definite acute process.
