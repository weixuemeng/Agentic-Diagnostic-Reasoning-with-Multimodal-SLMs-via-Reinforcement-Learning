                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Headache and weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is vague opacity measuring about 25 mm that projects over the lateral
 right upper lung.  Projecting over the upper mid left lung is a more linear
 opacity measuring about 7 mm in width and perhaps 4-5 cm in length. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is slight leftward convex curvature
 centered along the lower thoracic spine as well as very mild exaggeration of
 kyphotic curvature.  Mid thoracic interspaces are mildly narrowed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.  Patchy opacities in each
 upper lung, with a morphology suggestive of scarring on the left, while
 particularly referring to the right, there is potentially a substantial
 nodule.  When clinically appropriate, chest CT evaluation is recommended as
 well as correlation with prior radiographs, if available.
