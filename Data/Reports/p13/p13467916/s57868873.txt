 FINDINGS: 
 
 The small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged after removal of the chest

 lobe segmentectomy. Opacification of the medial right lung base likely
 represents atelectasis or collapse of the remaining right middle lobe. There
 may be a small right pleural effusion. The left lung is clear. There is no
 pulmonary edema.

 1. Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
 2. Atelectasis or collapse of the right middle lobe.
