                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.  History of lung disease. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.    There are increased interstitial
 markings throughout the lungs bilaterally which demonstrate low volumes. 
 There is no confluent consolidation or effusion.  Hiatal hernia is noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality seen noting hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Evidence of chronic interstitial lung disease without definite evidence of
 confluent consolidation.  Please note that subtle infection would be difficult
 to exclude, especially without prior exam to evaluate for interval change.
