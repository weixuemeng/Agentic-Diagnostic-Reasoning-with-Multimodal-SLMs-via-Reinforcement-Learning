                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain cough  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Postsurgical changes in the
 right hemi thorax noted with multiple surgical clips abutting the right
 mediastinal border as well as suture material in the right perihilar region
 and right apex.  Volume loss in the right lung noted with elevated right
 hemidiaphragm.  Surgical clips are noted in the left axilla and left lower
 chest wall.  Subtle peripheral opacity in the left lower lung on the frontal
 view is somewhat unusual in appearance for pneumonia though appears new from
 the prior exam.  The possibility of an early pneumonia difficult to exclude. 
 No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New peripheral opacity in the left lower lung could represent an early
 pneumonia though somewhat unusual in appearance.  Followup to resolution is
 advised.
