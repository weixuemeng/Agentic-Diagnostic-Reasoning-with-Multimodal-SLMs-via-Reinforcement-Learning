                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and sputum.  Assess for lesion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal opacity,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Enlargement of pulmonary arteries is
 compatible with known history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours are unremarkable, with density over the trachea and
 aortic arch on the lateral view, compatible with known calcified mediastinal
 lymph nodes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process with stable calcified mediastinal
 nodes consistent with prior granulomatous disease
