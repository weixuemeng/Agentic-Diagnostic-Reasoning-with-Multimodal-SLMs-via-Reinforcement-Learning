                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ETOH abuse, frequent falls, question rib fracture.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___  AP chest x-ray.
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  Heart size is at the upper limits
 of normal or slightly enlarged.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.  There is
 slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is atelectasis at
 both bases.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 No localizing history is provided.  Allowing for this, no lucent fracture line
 or displaced rib fracture is detected on these lung technique films.Small
 density overlying the right lung apex appears to represent some normal variant
 ridging along the anterior right rib.
 
 Irregular mineralization in the distal left clavicle could represent sequela
 of old distal clavicle fracture.  No left AC joint diastasis is identified. 
 There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and thoracolumbar
 region.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Minimal basilar atelectasis.  Borderline cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary
 process identified.  
 
 2) No displaced rib fracture identified on these lung technique films.  No
 pleural fluid or pneumothorax identified.
