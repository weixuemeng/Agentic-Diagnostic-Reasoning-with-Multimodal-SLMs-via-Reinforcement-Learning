 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with anasarca, lung crackles  // eval ? pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.

 Allowing for differences in technique and projection, mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 congestion.
