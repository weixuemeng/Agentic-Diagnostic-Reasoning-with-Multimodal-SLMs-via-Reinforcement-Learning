 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man now re-intubated.  // ETT position      ETT
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___.  It may have obscured preexisting pneumonia in the right lung.  Today
 edema has decreased, but there is still ground-glass opacification in the left
 lung and consolidation at both lung bases, so active pneumonia is still a
 possibility.  Small to moderate pleural effusion is stable.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged but mediastinal venous engorgement has improved.
 ET tube in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction, and a transesophageal tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.  No pneumothorax.
