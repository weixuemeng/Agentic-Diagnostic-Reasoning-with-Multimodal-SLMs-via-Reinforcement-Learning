                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with perforated duodenum, prolonged intubation 
 // ? acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position 4.5 cm above the carina.
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the SVC/ RA junction. No definite NG tube
 is identified. However, an NG tube may be faintly seen extending beyond the
 inferior edge of this film. An additional line or catheter overlies the upper
 abdomen in the midline, coursing from the right inferior to left superior to
 overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus. Thin wiring over the chest is
 also present --? residual lead.
 
 Again seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with prominence of the
 mediastinum. There is diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, and patchy opacity at the right base similar to the
 prior film. The possibility of trace right pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening hazy density suggests increased CHF. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal
 and pulmonary parenchymal findings are similar to the film from 1 day earlier.
 2. Difficult to distinguish an NG tube. Also, additional line seen over upper
 abdomen. Please see comment above.
