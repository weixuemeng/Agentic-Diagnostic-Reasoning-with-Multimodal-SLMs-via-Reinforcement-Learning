                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe shoulder and clavicle pain
 exacerbated by breathing and movement and one week of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is
 no evidence for pulmonary edema.  
 
 The visualized portions of the clavicles demonstrate no evidence for fracture
 on these views, although the distal right clavicle is not included and this
 study.  Evaluation is also suboptimal since the patient is rotated, but there
 is suggestion of widening of the right sternoclavicular joint.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 2.  Possible widening of the right sternoclavicular joint, incompletely
 evaluated on these rotated views.  Further evaluation is recommended with true
 frontal view of the sternoclavicular joints.  
 
 These findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ by telephone at 3:35 a.m. on ___.
