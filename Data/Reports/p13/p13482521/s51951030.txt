                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of altered mental status.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked cardiomegaly; given the morphology, a pericardial
 effusion could also be considered.  Retrocardiac opacification is not
 specific, but probably includes a pleural effusion.  Vague opacity in the
 right lower lung is not entirely specific but suggestive of fluid along the
 major fissure.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Opacities at the left lower lobe, right lung base, and upper right lung,
 including probable pleural effusions.  Commonly this type of appearance is due
 to atelectasis although pneumonia is possible.  Opacification in the right
 lower lung is most suggestive primarily o pleural fluid.  Parenchyma shows
 mild pulmonary venous hypertension.  
 
 2. Given the morphology of the heart, the presence of a pericardial effusion
 could be considered.
