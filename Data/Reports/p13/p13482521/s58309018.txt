 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Improved aeration is seen on
 the current exam.  Previously seen bibasilar opacities are no longer
 visualized.  The lungs are now clear.  No significant pleural effusion seen,
 noting that the inferior most aspect of the right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view on the lateral exam.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged with a similar configuration compared to prior, potentially due to
 cardiomegaly or potentially effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with possible pericardial effusion as previously
 described.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
