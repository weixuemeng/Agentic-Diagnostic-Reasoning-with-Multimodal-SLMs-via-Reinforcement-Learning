                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, dyspnea and history of PCP.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Aeration of the lungs has
 improved since ___; peripheral opacities have cleared.  A diffuse
 interstitial pattern of pulmonary opacity remains.  Minimally increased left
 lower lobe opacity is attributable to atelectasis.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved aeration of the lungs peripherally.  Persistent interstitial opacity
 compatible with known PCP.
