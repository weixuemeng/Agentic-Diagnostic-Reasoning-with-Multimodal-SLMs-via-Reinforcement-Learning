                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD, HIV, dyspnea, bronchoscopy, transbronchial
 biopsy; rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___ and
 CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient has bilateral interstitial and ground-glass opacities that are under
 investigation.  This has slightly increased since ___ and the
 increased density in the left lower lung is probably due to hemorrhage after
 transbronchial biopsy.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal contour is normal.  Cardiac contour is top normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pneumothorax after left lower lung biopsy.  Increased density
 in left lower lung is due to hemorrhage after procedure.
 2.  Bilateral widespread interstitial and ground-glass opacities are under
 investigation, slightly increased since ___.  The first diagnosis
 to consider would be an infectious process, primarily pneumocystis infection
 in an HIV patient. Considering the cysts and the nodules on recent CT scan,
 LIP could also be considered.
