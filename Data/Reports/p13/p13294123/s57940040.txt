                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with COPD, 1 wk incr cough, DOE, ddx includes most
 likely COPD exacerbation less likely PNA or CHF  // evaluate ? infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been
 slight interval increase in now moderate pulmonary interstitial edema and
 central pulmonary vascular congestion.  A background of prominent interstitial
 markings likely reflects underlying interstitial lung disease, as before. 
 Perihilar and bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Partially imaged
 cervical spinal hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion and
 edema.  Streaky bilateral airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection is not excluded.
