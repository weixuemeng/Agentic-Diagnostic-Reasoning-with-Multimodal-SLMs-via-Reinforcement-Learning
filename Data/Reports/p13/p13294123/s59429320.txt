                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV on HAART presenting with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  New focal opacity is demonstrated in the medial
 aspect of the left upper lobe, concerning for an infectious process.  The
 hilar contours are prominent bilaterally, unchanged.  Streaky opacity in the
 right lung base is similar, and there is diffuse coarsening of interstitial
 markings which is unchanged.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular
 congestion, or pneumothorax is present.  Partially imaged is cervical spinal
 fusion hardware.  Multiple clips are noted in the right upper quadrant the
 abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New consolidative opacity within the medial aspect of the left upper lobe
 concerning for an infectious process.  Followup radiographs after treatment
 are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.  
 
 2.  Continued diffuse coarsened interstitial opacities suggestive of a chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
