                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hallucinations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally, as also seen in prior
 study.  However, on the lateral view they seem slightly more prominent
 compared to the prior study and I cannot exclude an acute-on-chronic process. 
 Mild left base atelectasis/scarring is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally seen on the
 prior study; the frontal view appears similar to the prior study, although the
 lateral view suggests possible mild increase in the markings and thus an
 acute-on-chronic process may be present.
