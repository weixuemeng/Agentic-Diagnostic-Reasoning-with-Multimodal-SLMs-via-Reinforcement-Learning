                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___, CT chest
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is similar. 
 Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema, somewhat improved from the previous study.  Emphysematous
 changes are again seen within the upper lobes.  Focal opacity in the left
 perihilar region could reflect an area of superimposed infection.  Increased
 interstitial opacities in the lung bases are compatible with a mild chronic
 interstitial lung disease, as seen on the previous CTs.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized
 with multiple compression deformities noted at the thoracolumbar junction,
 unchanged.  Cervical spinal fusion hardware is not completely imaged. 
 Multiple clips are noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung
 disease.
 More focal opacity in the left perihilar region could reflect an area of
 infection.
