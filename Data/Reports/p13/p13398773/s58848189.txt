                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough,  chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt
 pulmonary edema. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is visualized. There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.
