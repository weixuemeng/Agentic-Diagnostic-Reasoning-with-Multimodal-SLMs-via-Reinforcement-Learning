                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is normal in size.  Previously, the left hemidiaphragm was somewhat
 elevated, but this has resolved.  Although volume loss has resolved, a lateral
 view now depicts a posterior basilar opacity, probably in the left lower lobe,
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Lumbar spinal fusion hardware is only partly visualized and not well assessed.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.
