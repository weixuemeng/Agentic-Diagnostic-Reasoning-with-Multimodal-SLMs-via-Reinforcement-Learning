                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___. Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta is
 diffusely calcified and tortuous.  Worsening diffuse ground-glass opacities
 with new vascular indistinctness is present.  This is superimposed on a
 background of increased interstitial markings with ground-glass opacification
 previously thought to reflect NSIP. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of
 chronic interstitial lung disease, previously thought to reflect NSIP.
 However, acute worsening of chronic interstitial lung disease or atypical
 infection is not excluded. Followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended
 for further assessment.
