                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough for the past week and dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison. 
 
 Technique: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is no significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Faint opacification and blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle on the AP view may represent an early developing pneumonia.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing
 for slight unfolding and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  There is
 calcification of the aortic knob.  Diffuse osseous demineralization is noted. 
 There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Airspace opacity in the right lung base may represent an early developing
 pneumonia.
