                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Febrile.  Cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 11:16 a.m.:
 
 Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are borderline engorged, but there is no
 pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion, and the heart size is normal.
 There is an increasing radiopacity at the right lung base, could be due to
 vascular crowding, but should be followed to exclude early pneumonia, given
 the clinical history.  No endotracheal tube is present.  A nasogastric tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
