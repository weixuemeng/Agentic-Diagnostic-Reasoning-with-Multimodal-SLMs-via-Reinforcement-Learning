                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ICD extraction and new implantation of a
 dual chamber ICD  // penumothroax and lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The abnormality on yesterday's chest radiograph raising concern for new left
 pleural effusion is smaller today. Some of the improvement is due to a
 decrease in the volume of left pleural effusion, now small, and some is
 probably due to improvement in left lower lobe atelectasis.
 
 Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead
 are continuous from the left pectoral generator. Mild cardiomegaly is still
 present, exaggerated by very low lung volumes.  Right lung is grossly clear
 and there is no pulmonary edema.
