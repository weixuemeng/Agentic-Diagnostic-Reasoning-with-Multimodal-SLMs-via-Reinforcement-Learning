                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion, status post drainage.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker, with lead tip over right ventricle.
 
 There is patchy opacity/atelectasis at the left base.  This is overall similar
 to the prior study, but the left hemidiaphragm is slightly less well defined
 on the current exam.  No discrete effusion is identified, though the left
 costophrenic angle is also less well defined on today's study.  There are low
 inspiratory volumes, with upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  Mild
 prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  As before,
 the left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The right lung is grossly clear, without
 right effusion.  Incidental note is made of a deep sulcus sign on the right,
 though, in the absence of clinical suspicion, this is unlikley ro represent a
 right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Atelectasis and possible small amount of pleural fluid at the
 left base, very similar, but arguably slightly worse, compared with one day
 earlier.  No left-sided pneumothorax detected.
