                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is streaky left mid to lower lung
 opacification which suggests atelectasis.  This appearance blurs the left
 costophrenic sulcus, making it difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left mid-to-lower lung opacities, which are probably
 compatible with atelectasis.  If pulmonary symptoms are present or there is
 other clinical concern for pneumonia, then short-term followup PA and lateral
 radiographs could be considered to evaluate further.
