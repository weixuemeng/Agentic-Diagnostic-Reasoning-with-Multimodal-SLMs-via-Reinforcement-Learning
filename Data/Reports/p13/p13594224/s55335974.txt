                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is an
 opacity at the left lower lung with meniscus on the lateral radiograph
 compatible with pleural effusion likely with a component of volume loss. 
 Underlying infection is a concern.  The right lung is clear.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. 
 Surgical clips project over the left axilla.  The included upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity at the left lower lung likely reflecting pleural effusion
 with a component of volume loss.  Underlying infection should be considered.
 
 These results were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 11:30 a.m.,
 ___, 5 minutes after discovery.
