                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with volume overload secondary to acute renal
 failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved, and there is no consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal.  No pleural effusions.  It is unclear
 whether a 15 mm wide round opacity projecting over the right fifth rib
 anteriorly is a nipple skin lesion or lung nodule.  Other lung nodules seen on
 recent chest CT are not obvious on these conventional radiographs, as
 expected.
