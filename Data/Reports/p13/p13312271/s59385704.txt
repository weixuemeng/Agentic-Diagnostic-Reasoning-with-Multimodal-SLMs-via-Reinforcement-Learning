                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY 
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pulmonary cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube ends 3.5 cm above carina.  NG tube is in adequate position.
 Improvement of right lower lobe density; improvement has been on a short
 period of time, so it was probably secondary to aspiration.  Stability of
 bilateral mild pulmonary edema.  Stability also of left lower lobe density. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contour are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes are in adequate position.
 2.  Improvement of right lower lobe aspiration.  Left lower lobe density is,
 however, stable.
 3.  Stability of mild pulmonary edema.
