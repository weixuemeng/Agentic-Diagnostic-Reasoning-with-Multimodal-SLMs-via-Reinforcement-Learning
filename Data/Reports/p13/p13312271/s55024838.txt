                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man intubated, please assess for tubes and line and
 if there are infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the
 supine position.  Endotracheal tube now appears to terminate 1 cm above the
 carina and is considered too low.  Right internal jugular central venous
 catheter is unchanged.  NG tube appears to enter the stomach, but the tip is
 not visualized.
 
 Heart size cannot be accurately assessed due to the AP projection, but and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild improvement in right basilar
 atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is positioned too low.  Suggest pulling the tube back
 2-3 cm.
 2.  Improvement in bibasilar atelectasis with presence of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
