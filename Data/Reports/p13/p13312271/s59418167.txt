                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post arrest and intubated.  Question
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the ET tube
 terminating approximately 1.7 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube courses
 inferiorly out of view into the stomach.  The heart is normal in size.  There
 is evidence of prior coronary arterial bypass surgery and aortic valve
 replacement.  Calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There is moderate perihilar fluffy opacity as well as veil-like
 appearance of the lungs, left greater than right, suggestive of vascular
 congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  The opacities appear particularly
 confluent in the right greater than left lower lungs, which could represent
 sequela of aspiration, with infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube 1.7 cm from the carina, should be retracted by approximately 2 cm.
 2.  Perihilar opacities and veil-like lung attenuation, suggesting mild edema.
 3.  More confluent opacity in the lung bases could be related to aspiration,
 with infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ via phone at 12:30 a.m. on ___.
