                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of diabetes, search for cardiac or pulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest film, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  There are several
 non-characteristic parenchymal scars, notably at the lung periphery, but no
 evidence of relevant disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Status
 post CABG and sternotomy.  The alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged. 
 Status post valvular replacement.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette,
 no pleural effusions.
