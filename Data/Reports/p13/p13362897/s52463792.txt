                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Large volume emesis and desaturation. assess for aspiration.
 Patient with known ILD.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 There is respiratory motion artifact.  Allowing this limitation, there is
 increased density of the right lower lobe, concerning for a new area of
 aspiration.  Diffuse reticular opacities are unchanged, consistent with
 patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease.  Denser opacities in the
 left perihilar region and left lower lobe are unchanged.  There are persistent
 low lung volumes.  Widened mediastinum and enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette are unchanged.  Patient has known mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the lower
