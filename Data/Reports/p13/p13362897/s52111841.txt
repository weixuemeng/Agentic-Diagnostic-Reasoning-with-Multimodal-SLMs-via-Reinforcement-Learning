                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with ILD, intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior studies from ___.
 
 The appearance of the cardiomediastinum is unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is
 moderate.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT from ___.  Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position.  Right PICC tip is
 difficult to evaluate, can be followed to the lower SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side are unchanged,
 likely atelectasis.  Patient has known chronic interstitial lung disease,
 superimposed there is increasing diffuse density of the interstitial markings.
 This suggests again exacerbation of the chronic interstitial lung disease,
 less likely edema.
