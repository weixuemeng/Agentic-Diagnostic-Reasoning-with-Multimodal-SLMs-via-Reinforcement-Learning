                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with NG tube pulled, replaced, check
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 portable chest examination ___ ___.  The patient remains intubated,
 the ETT terminating in the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina. 
 Position is unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Again noted are the
 diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings that have appeared to be
 grossly stable on numerous preceding transferred chest examinations.  Today, a
 new chest CT was performed confirming the increased interstitial markings. 
 Detailed evaluation including comparison with previous CT is presently being
 performed.  On the present portable chest examination, no significant interval
 change in comparison with yesterday's examination can be identified.
