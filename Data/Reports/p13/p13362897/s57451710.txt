                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:24 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with interstitial lung disease on a ventilator. 
 Suspect new pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The generalized background density of the lungs has varied over the past two
 weeks, the differences from day to day is probably due to pulmonary edema. 
 The edema seen on ___ has improved.  Interstitial pulmonary disease is
 moderate-to-severe, is shown by the outside chest ___ ___.  This also
 shows probable pulmonary arterial hypertension, a fusiform aneurysm of the
 ascending thoracic aorta, diameter ___-53 mm.  Cardiomegaly is generally left
 atrium and left ventricular.  Mediastinum is widened beyond cardiomegaly by
 mediastinal fat and relatively mild prevascular and paratracheal adenopathy.
 
 Left PIC line crosses to the right brachiocephalic vein, unchanged. 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
 
 It will be very difficult to detect pneumonia prior to the stage of severe
 consolidation given concurrent abnormalities in the lungs, chronic and acute.
