 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:19 PM
  ETT at inferior clavicular margin.  OG extends out of field of view.  L PICC
  line extends to right mediastinal margin, likely against the SVC sidewall.
  Widened mediastinum and moderate cardiomegally.  Diffuse reticular opacities
  may reflect the patient's known ILD.  A compoenent of pulmonary edema may also
  be present.  Suggest correlation with CT scan from OSH.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with interstitial lung disease.  Intubated.  New
 PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 4:13 a.m.:
 
 Lung volumes and moderate pulmonary edema have both improved since 4:13 a.m. 
 Although the interstitial pulmonary abnormality is chronic pulmonary fibrosis,
 but for example on ___, the lungs have been more clear at times. 
 Mediastinal widening reflects a component of acute mediastinal vascular
 congestion, though improved over the past several days.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess, probably mildly enlarged, but chronic.  Acute pleural
 effusion if any is relatively small.  No pneumothorax.  Left PIC line extends
 into the right brachiocephalic vein and would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to the
 origin of the superior vena cava.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric
 tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
