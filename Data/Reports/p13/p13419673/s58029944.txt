                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female postop day 3 status post aortobifemoral bypass
 who presents for evaluation of fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 normal. There is a new veil-like density over the bases of both lungs
 reflecting new small bilateral pleural effusions. An relative increase in
 opacification at the left base is either atelectasis or pneumonia. The small
 amount of right subdiaphragmatic free air is presumably post-procedural. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  Hilar and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Interval increase in left basal atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 
 3. Subdiaphragmatic gas under the right hemidiaphragm, likely post-procedural.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:24 a.m. by Dr. ___ by
 telephone on ___.
