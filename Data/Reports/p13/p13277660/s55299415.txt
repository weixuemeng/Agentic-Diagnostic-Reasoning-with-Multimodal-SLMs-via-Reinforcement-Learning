                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Two weeks of productive cough and possible fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently chest radiograph
 of ___.  Also comparison to chest CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Linear opacities in
 lung bases, left greater than right, are compatible with bronchiectasis with
 likely atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar linear opacities, left greater than right, compatible
 with bronchiectasis with likely atelectasis, although pneumonia is not
 excluded.
