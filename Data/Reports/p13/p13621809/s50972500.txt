                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle seen on the frontal view
 which may be due to pleural thickening versus a trace pleural effusion.  The
 right lung is clear.  The lungs are hyperinflated suggesting underlying COPD. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle on the frontal view may be due to
 pleural thickening, but a trace pleural effusion is not excluded.
