                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with a prolonged productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Lateral view shows a new mediastinal
 abnormality posterior to the heart, probably a hiatus hernia, above which the
 esophagus is mildly distended with air.  There is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  The heart is normal size.  
 
 If this explanation does not fit the clinical profile, CT scanning would be
 diagnostic.
