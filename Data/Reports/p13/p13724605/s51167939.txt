                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer status post chemo radiation and drainage
 of pericardial effusion with drain still in place.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Coinciding with interval drainage, the cardiac contour appears decreased
 although still mildly enlarged. It is partly obscured at the left and inferior
 portions by confluent left basilar opacification with a substantial pleural
 effusion, probably again moderate to large, with loculation, but similar to
 prior findings. Right paramediastinal and left hilar mass effect appears
 decreased as since the prior radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent confluent left basilar opacification with a left pleural effusion,
 including some degree of loculation. Decreased cardiac contour.
