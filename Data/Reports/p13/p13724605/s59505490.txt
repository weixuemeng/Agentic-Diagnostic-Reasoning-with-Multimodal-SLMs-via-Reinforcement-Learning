                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Consolidation in the left lower lobe and probably
 also in the lingula is grossly unchanged.  The right lung is clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or new consolidations.  Degenerative
 changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left lung pneumonia.  Followup in four weeks is
 recommended to assess for resolution.
