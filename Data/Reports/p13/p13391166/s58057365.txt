                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with gunshot wound, now status post
 tracheostomy and placement of feeding tube, check position.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube which has its tip 3 to 3.5 cm
 above the carina.  Interval placement of a feeding tube which has its tip
 coursing below the diaphragm and projecting over the stomach.  Removal of the
 nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity as well as an opacity in the
 right medial lung base.  These findings most likely reflect lobar atelectasis,
 although aspiration or contusion should also be considered.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  No large pleural effusions.
