                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  New oxygen requirement, crackles on exam, altered
 mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with substantial widening of
 the mediastinum, presumed due to tortuous aorta.  However, on this study, a
 dilated ascending aorta would not be excluded; however, findings are stable as
 compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No significant interval
 change.  Persistent widening of the mediastinum which may be related to a
 dilated tortuous aorta which can be further evaluated on CT.
