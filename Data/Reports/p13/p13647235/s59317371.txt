                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:41 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and COPD, and new
 hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality is new.  Since there is no
 substantial change in longstanding mediastinal venous and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, this might not be interstitial pulmonary edema, due instead to
 transfusion or drug reaction.  Clinical correlation advised.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and dilated or tortuous ascending thoracic aorta are also
 chronic.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
