                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 including an enlarged convex right lateral mediastinal contour suggesting
 dilatation of the ascending aorta although probably unchanged.  Costophrenic
 sulci are not completely excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax, and the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.  Suspected dilatation and
 possibly substantial aneurysm of the ascending aorta.  If not already
 performed, evaluation with a chest CT could be considered when clinically
 appropriate.
