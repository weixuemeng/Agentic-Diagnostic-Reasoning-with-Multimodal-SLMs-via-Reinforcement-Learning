 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, varying volume status  // ?infiltrate
 ?pulm edema      ?infiltrate ?pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there again is moderate
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar opacifications appear increased on the right, most likely consistent
 with atelectasis and pleural effusion.  The monitoring and support devices are
 unchanged.
 Given the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it
 would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
