                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Five days of dyspnea and cough, suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Increased size of the right hilus is most likely due to new surrounding
 opacity, highly concerning for infectious process.  Given its rapid
 development (normal appearance on ___), it most likely reflects
 infectious process rather than neoplasm.  Followup of this area four weeks
 after completion of antibiotic therapy is required for documentation of
 resolution.  If findings persist, chest CT is necessary.
 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is
 unchanged, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.
