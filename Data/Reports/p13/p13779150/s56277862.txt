                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness and poor appetite, pulmonary metastasis from
 colorectal cancer, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Bilateral lung
 masses are re-demonstrated in a similar pattern as on prior CT compatible with
 known metastatic disease.  It is difficult to assess for subtle progression. 
 No definite signs of superimposed pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary metastatic disease.  No convincing signs of
 superimposed pneumonia.
