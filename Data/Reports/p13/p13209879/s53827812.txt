 HISTORY:  Cancer resection for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends at
 least to the lower body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of

 complication.  Bibasilar opacifications most likely reflect atelectasis, with
 possible small effusion on the left.  There may be mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.
