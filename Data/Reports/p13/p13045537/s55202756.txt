                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated transfer with left lower lobe opacity. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None available. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low and exaggerate the pulmonary vascular markings.  ET tube
 is in the lower trachea at 3.2 cm from the carina.  Right IJ tip is in the
 upper SVC.  Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. 
 
 While the heart size is exaggerated due to technique, it is still enlarged. 
 The superior mediastinum also appears prominent. There is enlargement of the
 pulmonary arteries and azygous vein.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in place in the lower trachea. 
 
 2. Lung volumes are extremely low. The heart and pulmonary arteries appear
 significantly enlarged, raising suspicion for a cardiac etiology.
