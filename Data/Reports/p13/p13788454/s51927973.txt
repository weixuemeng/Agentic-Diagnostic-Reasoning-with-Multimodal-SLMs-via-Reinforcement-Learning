                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate size left pleural effusion is not substantially changed in the
 interval with associated left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  Fluid is
 also noted overlying the left apex as well as loculated posteriorly along the
 left base.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The right lung is clear.  Multiple pulmonary
 nodules are seen in both lungs, increased in size and number compared to the
 previous exam, with the largest noted in the left mid lung field measuring up
 to 2 cm.  No large pneumothorax is present.  Elevation of the left high
 hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated and attributable to multiple extensive
 hepatic masses.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with similar-appearing moderate
 left pleural effusion, a component which is loculated at the posterior base,
 and left basilar opacity likely atelectasis.
 2. Increased size and number of bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for
 progression of metastatic disease.
