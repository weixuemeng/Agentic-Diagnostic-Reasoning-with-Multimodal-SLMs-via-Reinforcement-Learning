                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Intubated.  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside reference chest radiograph from "___"; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine frontal view of the chest. 
 
 An NG type tube terminates over the stomach with its side port past the GE
 junction.  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 4 cm above the carina.  
 
 The lung volumes are low; however, no chf, focal opacity, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis.
 The heart size appears enlarged; however, this is likely due to the technique.
 Rounded right paratracheal density could represent a proominent azygous vein
 or possibly a lymph node. There is no free air in the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  The upper enteric tube ends
 in the stomach.  
 2) Atelectasis, without other evidence for an acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 3) ? prominent azygous vein.
