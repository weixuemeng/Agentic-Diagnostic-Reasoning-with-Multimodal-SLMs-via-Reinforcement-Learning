                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 PLEASE NOTE PATIENT ALSO HAS THE MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER ___ AND ___
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Decreased breath sounds on right, dull to percussion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.  There has been
 interval increase in opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax,
 combination of patient's known pulmonary malignancy along with pleural
 effusion and possible consolidation.  There is blunting along the right
 costophrenic angle and there appears to be fluid tracking inferiorly.  The
 right hemidiaphragm is also partially obscured.  The left lung is clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in right upper hemithorax opacity with the
 right upper lung almost completely opacified.  Findings likely represent
 combination of known pulmonary mass, pleural effusion, and underlying
 consolidation/collapse.  There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
