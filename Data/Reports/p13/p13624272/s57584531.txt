 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is increased opacification
 along the right lateral chest wall between the previously described upper and
 mid zone opacification and the blunted costophrenic angle. In view of the
 right chest tube being removed, this most likely reflects reaccumulation of
 pleural effusion.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
