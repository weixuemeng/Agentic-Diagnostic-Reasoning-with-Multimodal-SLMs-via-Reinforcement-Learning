                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dense consolidation is present in the right upper lobe, involving
 the posterior segment to a greater degree than the anterior segment and with
 relative sparing of the apex.  Centrally in the right juxtahilar region is a
 large rounded opacity, with medial border is obscured by the adjacent
 consolidation.  Heart size is normal, and mediastinal and left hilar contours
 are normal.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe consolidation is consistent with clinically
 suspected pneumonia.  Large rounded opacity centrally in right juxtahilar
 region is concerning for a central mass which could potentially cause a
 post-obstructive pneumonia.  With this in mind, further evaluation with
 contrast-enhanced chest CT is suggested, as communicated by telephone to Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 8:40 a.m. at the time of discovery.
