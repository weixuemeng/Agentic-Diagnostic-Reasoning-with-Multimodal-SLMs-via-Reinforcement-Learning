                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  General malaise, wheezing heard in expiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large rounded opacity projecting over the left mid lung,
 measuring approximately 6.4 x 4.3 cm.  Additionally, there is a right
 perihilar opacity, the medial portion of which is not well assessed, but which
 measures approximately at least 2.5 x 2.7 cm.  There is mild left base
 atelectasis/scarring.  No large pleural effusion is seen although trace
 pleural effusion will be difficult to exclude.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The patient is rotated
 slightly to the left.  There may also be a subtle opacity projecting over the
 anterior right fourth rib.  There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  At least two rounded opacities, one projecting over the left mid
 lung measures 6.4 x 4.4 cm and one in the right perihilar region measuring 2.5
 x 2.7 cm.  Findings are highly worrisome for malignancy.  There may be a
 second smaller focus of opacity projecting over the right anterior fourth rib.
 If patient does not have known pulmonary malignancy, recommend nonurgent chest
 CT with contrast for further evaluation.
 
 Patient has two medical record numbers.  Patient has history of lung
 malignancy with rounded opacities increased in size since the prior study
 worrisome for progression of disease.
