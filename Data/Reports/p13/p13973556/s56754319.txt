                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Vertigo, recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is an
 opacity projecting over the left upper-to-mid lung which on the lateral view
 may be within the superior segment of the left lower lobe.  Right mid lung
 perihilar opacity is also seen.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Patchy
 opacities over the right middle lobe on the lateral view may be due to
 atelectasis or underlying consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There are degenerative changes at the right shoulder
 and acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Left upper-to-mid pulmonary opacity with central lucency, worrisome for
 cavitation.  Additional right infrahilar nodular opacity.  Findings infectious
 versus malignancy until proven otherwise.
