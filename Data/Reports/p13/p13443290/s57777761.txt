                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with epigastric pain.  Evaluate for free subdiaphragmatic
 air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Apparent widening of the
 vascular pedicle is secondary to a tortuous and unfolded aorta, better
 assessed in the lateral view.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures are identified.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
