 not clearly seen on the radiograph and are better assessed on CT chest. There
 is mild bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is normal. A left chest
 pacemaker has leads terminating within the right ventricle and the right
 atrium. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Known rib fractures and small right pleural effusion are better assessed on
 concurrent CT chest.  No focal consolidation.
