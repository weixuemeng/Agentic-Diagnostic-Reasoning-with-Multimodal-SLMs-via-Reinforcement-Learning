                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:04
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with SBO, hypoxia.  Question infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 13:04 is submitted.  The left lateral
 chest wall and costophrenic angle are not entirely included.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is a bilateral air space
 process with layering pleural effusions.  These findings together favor
 moderate pulmonary edema with bibasilar compressive atelectasis rather than
 diffuse pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Calcific density contiguous to the
 greater tuberosity of the right humerus may be related to remote trauma or the
 presence of calcific tendinitis.  Clinical correlation is advised.
