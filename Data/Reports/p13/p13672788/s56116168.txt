                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and altered mental status. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and chest radiographs from ___, ___, and multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  There are conspicuous interstitial
 markings and vascular cephalization with bilateral hilar engorgement. Of note,
 hilar lymphadenopathy documented in recent CT is also contributing to the
 hilar conspicuity. Moderate cardiomegaly appears slightly worsened than in
 prior exam although AP projection hinders accurate comparison.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema in the setting of moderate cardiomegaly.
