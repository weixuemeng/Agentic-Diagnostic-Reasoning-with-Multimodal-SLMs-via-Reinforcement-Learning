                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new interstitial pulmonary abnormality predominantly in the right
 lung has little basal predominance.  Increased prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature is suggestive of elevated left atrial pressure, but not
 generalized volume overload.  Right hilar enlargement could be nodal or
 vascular.  An area of linear scarring in the left lower hemithorax is
 unchanged.  The heart size is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Active interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhage, or drug reaction, more
 likely than edema, but not certain. Possible right hilar adenopathy. If
 patient is immunocompromised, pneumocystis should be considered.   
 
 Dr ___ and I discussed these findings at 8:15AM.
