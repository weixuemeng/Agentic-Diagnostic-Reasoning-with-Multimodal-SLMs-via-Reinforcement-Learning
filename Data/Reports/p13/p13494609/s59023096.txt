                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There may be
 minimal consolidation at the bases bilaterally. No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is a diffuse interstitial prominence and some peribronchial
 wall thickening suggestive of a atypical infectious process/airways
 inflammation.  Interstitial edema is considered less likely given lack of
 change known heart size and pulmonary vessels compared to baseline chest
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial prominence and peribronchial wall thickening suggestive
 of an atypical pneumonia.
