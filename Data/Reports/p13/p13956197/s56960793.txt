                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of Crohn's disease, now with
 three days of fever of unknown origin.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are diffuse lung opacities, right
 greater than left, new from prior and worrisome for asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Given relative increased density of the right base, a right lower lobe
 pneumonia is not excluded.  No large effusion is identified.  Enlargement and
 indistinctness of the hila is likely secondary to vascular engorgement.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely due to edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New moderate pulmonary edema. Right greater than left opacities
 may be due to asymmetric edema, though a right-sided pneumonia is not
 excluded.
