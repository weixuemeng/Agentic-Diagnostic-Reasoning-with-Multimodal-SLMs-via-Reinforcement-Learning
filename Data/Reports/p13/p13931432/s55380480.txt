 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is increasing patchy opacity at the right base which likely reflects a
 layering effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the lower lobe. A
 superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung is grossly
 clear with the exception of a linear opacity in the left mid to lower lung
 which likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No
 pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
