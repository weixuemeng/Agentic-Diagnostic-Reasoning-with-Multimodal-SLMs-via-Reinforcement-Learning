                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an increased opacity in the retrocardiac region as well as
 increased opacity in the right lower lobe.  Otherwise, the remainder of the
 lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No acute fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacities which raise suspicion for pneumonia in the
 left lower lobe. A followup radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended to ensure
 resolution.
