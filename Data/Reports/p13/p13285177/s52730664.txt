                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea, ___% on room air.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Since prior, there has been interval
 improvement in the appearance of the lungs with nearly resolved interstitial
 edema.  There is blunting of posterior costophrenic angles potentially due to
 trace effusions versus atelectasis.  There is no confluent consolidation. 
 Streaking midlung opacities may be due to atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Median sternotomy wires are noted.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improvement in appearance of the lungs with near complete resolution of
 previously seen edema.  Possible trace effusions bilaterally.
