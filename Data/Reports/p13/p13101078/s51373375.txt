                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation and orogastric tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph obtained the same day, ___ min previously.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an enteric tube,
 which appears to traverse the thorax along the expected course of the
 esophagus. Its terminal tip appears to project within the stomach in
 appropriate position. An endotracheal tube is identified, in appropriate
 position 5.2 cm from the carina. There has been little interval change when
 compared to prior examination obtained 2 hr previously. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable. Several left-sided rib fractures are noted with no
 pneumothorax identified. No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is
 identified. Elevation of the right minor fissure reflect right upper lobe
 atelectasis.  A right paratracheal hilar calcification is thought to possibly
 reflect a calcified node.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Orogastric tube in appropriate position.  No significant changes since prior
 study obtained 8 minutes previously.
