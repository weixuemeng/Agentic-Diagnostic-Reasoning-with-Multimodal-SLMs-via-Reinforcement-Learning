                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with aspiration, ill-appearing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The lung volumes are
 low. Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely
 calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky linear opacities are seen in
 both lung bases, more pronounced on the left, and likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm appears chronic.
 Multiple remote right-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated.  There has
 been prior resection of the distal right clavicle.  Moderate degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
