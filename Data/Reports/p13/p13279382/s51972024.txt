                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with aspiration.  Assess NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Three successive frontal views of the chest show repositioning of
 nasogastric tube, first in the upper midline, either in the airway or
 esophagus, second looped at the gastroesophageal junction, and third still
 looped at the gastroesophageal junction.  Findings were discussed with the
 medical student normal, by telephone, at 4:00 p.m.
 
 Lungs are essentially clear.  Heart is top normal size.  There is no pleural
 abnormality.  Colon remained significantly distended, a new finding on
 ___.  There is partially formed stool impregnated with contrast agent
 in the right colon.  I recommended abdominal radiographs to assess the full
 extent of any colonic dilatation or possible obstruction.
