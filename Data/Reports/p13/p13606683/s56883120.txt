                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a presyncopal episode.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Linear opacities within the left lung base
 appear unchanged compared to recent prior examination and are consistent with
 plate-like atelectasis or scarring.  Flattened hemidiaphragms and
 hyperexpansion of the lungs suggest underlying obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  A trace left pleural effusion is newly identified.  
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  A prosthetic
 cardiac valve is again noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy
 wires appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged left lower lobe scarring/plate-like atelectasis.
 2.  New trace left pleural effusion.
