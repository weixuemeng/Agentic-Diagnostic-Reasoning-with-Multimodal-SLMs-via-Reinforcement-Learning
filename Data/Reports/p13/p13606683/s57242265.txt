                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  ICD pacing device remains in place, with unchanged position of
 leads in the right atrium, right ventricle and an additional lead for
 biventricular pacing.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable in appearance, is
 accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution and mild interstitial edema.
 The latter superimposed upon chronic pleural and parenchymal scarring within
 the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.  Lung volumes are increased, in keeping
 with history of COPD.  There are questionable small bilateral pleural
 effusions present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema superimposed
 upon chronic changes of emphysema and pleural-parenchymal scarring.
