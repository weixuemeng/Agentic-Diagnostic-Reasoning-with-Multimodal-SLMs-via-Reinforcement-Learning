                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of intra-aortic balloon pump terminates about 5 cm below the
 superior aspect of the aortic knob, and a Swan-Ganz catheter continues to
 terminate in the region of the distal right interlobar pulmonary artery. 
 Other indwelling devices are in standard and unchanged position.  Persistent
 cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and improving
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions have also decreased
 in size.  Apparent moderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm could potentially
 represent a subpulmonic component of left pleural effusion.  Consider a left
 lateral decubitus radiograph if warranted clinically.
