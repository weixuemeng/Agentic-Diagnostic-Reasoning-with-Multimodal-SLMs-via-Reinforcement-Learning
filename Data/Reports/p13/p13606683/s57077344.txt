                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 1:18 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with advanced heart failure, admitted for
 CHF exacerbation, placement of endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 22:04.
 
 AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 1:18 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter which
 has its tip in the right interlobar artery.  There has been interval placement
 of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip
 approximately 3 cm above the carina.  Heart remains enlarged, which most
 likely reflects cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be
 excluded.  The mediastinum appears widened but this is likely related to
 patient rotation.  There are bilateral layering effusions with retrocardiac
 consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis.  In addition,
 there has been interval appearance of moderate pulmonary and interstitial
 edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement.  A right-sided pacer remains in
 place.  Right internal jugular central line also is unchanged in position.
