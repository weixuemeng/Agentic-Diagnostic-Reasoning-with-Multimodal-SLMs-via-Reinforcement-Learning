                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with worsening hypoxia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___, obtained at 9:52 a.m.
 
 Current study demonstrates interval redevelopment of interstitial pulmonary
 edema seen in perihilar areas and lower lobes.  It obscures currently the
 appearance of the left upper lobe consolidation, but no interval worsening of
 the left upper lobe consolidation demonstrated.  Small amount of pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Pacemaker defibrillator leads are in unchanged
 position.
