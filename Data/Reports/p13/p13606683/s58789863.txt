 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval repositioning of left intra-aortic balloon pump, with tip
 now terminating 3.8 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. 
 Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within the right hilar region, likely in the
 distal interlobar pulmonary artery. This could be withdrawn a few centimeters
 for standard positioning.  Other indwelling devices are in standard position. 
 Stable cardiomegaly, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate
 edema with a mid and lower lung predominance in this patient with known upper
 lobe predominant emphysema.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are present,
 with interval increase in size on the left.
