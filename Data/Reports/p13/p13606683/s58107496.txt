                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of COPD, coronary artery disease
 status post CABG, CHF with diffuse wheezing.  Pneumonia versus edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exams
 from ___ and ___.
 
 Linear opacities at the left greater than right base are suggestive of
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Mildly indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are
 seen suggestive of mild failure; however, there is no definite confluent
 consolidation. Small left pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but stable.  Again seen is a prosthetic valve.  Median sternotomy
 wires are again seen with fracture at the inferior most wire.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly indistinct pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild
 failure without frank pulmonary edema.
