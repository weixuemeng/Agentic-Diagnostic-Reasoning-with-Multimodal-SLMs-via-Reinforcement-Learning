                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF.  Evaluate for change.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval appearance of bilateral layering pleural effusions and associated
 airspace opacity which most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although
 a pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  Right-sided pacer in place.  No pneumothorax.  Relative
 paucity of vasculature in the apices suggests a component of underlying
 emphysema.
