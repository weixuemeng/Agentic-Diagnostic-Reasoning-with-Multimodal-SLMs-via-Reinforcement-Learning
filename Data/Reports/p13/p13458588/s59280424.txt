                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC line dislodged periareolar position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scoliosis series ___.
 
 FINDINGS: No PICC is visualized.  There is a severe S-shaped scoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine, unchanged from ___.  The presence of this limits
 assessment of the cardiac silhouette, although, it appears unchanged.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Diffuse
 interstitial abnormality is likely to reflect changes from chronic lung
 disease, as there is no convincing evidence for concurrent pulmonary edema,
 unchanged from ___.  Sutures are seen in the right midlung.  Calcifications
 are seen within the aortic arch.  The known compression fractures of the
 thoracic spine are not well visualized.
