 lateral view and likely relates to overlying soft tissue.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated, likely to secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 There is diffuse osteopenia.
