                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver and respiratory failure.  Evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 3 cm from the carina.  A
 Swan-Ganz catheter overlies the expected area of the main pulmonary artery. 
 The lung volumes have improved and there has been a decrease in the pulmonary
 edema.  Hazy opacification at the left base is likely atelectasis, although
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  A gastric tube and a coiled Dobbhoff both end in the region of the
 pylorus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decrease in pulmonary edema.
 2.  Mild left basilar atelectasis, or less likely a developing pneumonia.
