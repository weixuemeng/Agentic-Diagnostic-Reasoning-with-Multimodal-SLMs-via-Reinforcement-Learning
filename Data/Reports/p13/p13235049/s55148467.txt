 HISTORY:  Hepatic encephalopathy with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Continued low lung volumes may account for much of the
 prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Mild residual
 retrocardiac atelectasis is seen at the left base with elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Right humeral deformity is again noted, consistent with remote
 injury.  Sequela of prior fracture is also seen in the right shoulder.
