                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver failure, evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest shows an ET tube whose tip
 terminates 4.4 cm above the carina.  A right side Swan-Ganz catheter tip
 terminates within the proximal pulmonary artery.  A large bore feeding tube
 terminates at the pylorus.  The previously seen post-pyloric feeding tube has
 been pulled back and is now coiled within the stomach, repositioning is
 recommended.  Compared to prior, the mild pulmonary edema and perihilar
 vascular congestion is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Poorly positioned feeding tube, repositioning is recommended.
 2.  Unchanged, mild pulmonary edema.
