                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with liver disease and altered mental status. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes
 and patient to be lordotic in position.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent,
 but likely accentuated by AP technique.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise within normal limits.  The lungs are clear.  Previously seen
 left basilar opacity has improved with better visualization of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.  Right humeral deformity is noted, compatible with remote injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of left basal opacity previously seen on
 ___.  No new findings to suggest definite pneumonia.
