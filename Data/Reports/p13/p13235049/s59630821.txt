                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  End-stage liver disease in a patient with left
 internal jugular line placement and right internal jugular line placement and
 fluid overload, followup.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed  
 
 The position of tubes and lines is unchanged since prior study.  There is mild
 interval improvement in vascular engorgement with almost normal appearance of
 the vessels in the right and left apices but still present basal and perihilar
 vascular engorgement.  The left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary artery might be consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension, correlation with echocardiography is suggested if clinically
 warranted.
