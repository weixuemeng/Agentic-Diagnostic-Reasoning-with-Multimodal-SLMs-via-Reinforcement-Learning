                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough for one month producing yellow sputum, former
 smoker, evaluation for cause of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 2-cm triangular basal opacity is only seen on lateral view overlying
 lower thoracic spine, of indeterminate significance and may represent artifact
 or chest wall superimposed density.  The rest of the exam is unremarkable. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION: Triangular opacity overlying lower thoracic spine is only visible
 on the lateral view and is of indeterminate significance.  This could be
 further assessed with lateral oblique views or a CT scan if preferred.
 
 This has been submitted to the radiology dashboard for direct notification of
 referring physician.
