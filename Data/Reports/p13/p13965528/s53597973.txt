                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with shortness of breath  // Eval for infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to priors, there has been no significant interval change. 
 Moderate to large right pleural effusion is again seen.  Linear underlying
 parenchymal opacities may be due to atelectasis versus scarring although
 underlying consolidation or lesion is not excluded.  Left lung remains clear. 
 Cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Hypertrophic changes are noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with associated
 airspace opacity likely at least in part due to atelectasis.
