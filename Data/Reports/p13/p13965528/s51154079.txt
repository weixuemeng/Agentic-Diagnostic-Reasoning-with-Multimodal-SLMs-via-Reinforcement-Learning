                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with complaints of shortness of breath with known
 right pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  MRI liver ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded but unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged with continued
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with a small pleural
 effusion, as seen on the previous MRI, and perhaps minimally decreased in
 size.  There is associated right basilar atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax or left-sided pleural effusion is present.  Mild degenerative
 changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small right pleural effusion, perhaps minimally decreased in size
 from the prior MRI, with associated right basilar atelectasis.
