                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute worsening abd pain after tips  //
 ?free air below diaphragm
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 Again seen is a small to moderate size right pleural effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation as well as cardiomegaly.  Allowing for technical
 factors, the effusion could be very slightly larger.  Possibility of some
 interval atelectasis at the right base medially cannot be excluded.  There is
 upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, similar to prior. 
 Probable atelectasis at the left lung base.  No left-sided effusion.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  On the right, the level of the
 diaphragm is somewhat uncertain.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 overall similar to prior, possibly slightly larger.
 
 Interval atelectasis at the right base medially cannot be excluded.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm, though the exact position of the right
 hemidiaphragm is not well-defined.
