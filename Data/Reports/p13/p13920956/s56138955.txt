                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
