                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough x1 week, fevers to 103 
 // r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Carinal are chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal. Lungs are fully expanded. . Lung vasculature is
 probably normal.
 
 Two  small nodular opacities projecting lateral to the right heart border at
 the level of the anterior right fourth rib and interspace could be costal
 calcifications, or small nodules in the lung. Chest CT scanning may be the
 only reliable way to make the distinction. The lungs are otherwise clear.
 Fullness in the right lower paratracheal station is due either to a distended
 azygos vein or enlarged lymph nodes, also it distinguishable by chest CT.
 
 The upper esophagus is mildly distended with air, not necessarily pathologic.
