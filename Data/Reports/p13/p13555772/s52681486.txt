                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post cervical laminectomy and
 fusion, not maintaining oxygen saturation, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's postoperative condition required examination in
 sitting semi-upright position using AP frontal and left lateral views. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination
 dated ___.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement as before. 
 The cardiac contours are suggestive of some left ventricular enlargement in
 this elderly woman.  Within the heart shadow, typical mitral ring
 calcifications can be identified. There is also some enlargement of the left
 atrium.  The pulmonary vasculature is not significantly congested and no new
 acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.  The patient's inspirational
 efforts are shallow resulting in relatively high-positioned diaphragms.  The
 lateral view obtained in marked tilted recumbent position shows mild blunting
 of the posterior pleural sinuses suggestive of some pleural effusion.  On the
 next preceding chest examination, the lateral view demonstrated completely
 free posterior pleural sinuses.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new acute pneumonic infiltrates, moderate
 cardiomegaly and some pleural densities posteriorly suggest some mild degree
 of CHF.  No other acute pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities are
 identified.
