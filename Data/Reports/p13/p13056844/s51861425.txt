                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AFib, on Coumadin with dyspnea.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, otherwise, the hilar and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is diffuse asymmetric opacities overlying
 the right lung with mild interstitial thickening.  Overall, the left lung
 appears to be clear aside from mild interstitial thickening.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Asymmetric opacities overlying the right lung with mild bilateral interstitial
 thickening.  This is likely secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema; however,
 a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  Given patient's
 clinical history of hemoptysis and epistaxis, alveolar hemorrhage can also be
 considered in the differential.
