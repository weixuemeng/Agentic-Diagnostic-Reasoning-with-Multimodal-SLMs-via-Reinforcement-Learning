                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD & possible CHF, presenting with dyspnea.  Question pulmonary
 edema, infection.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 13:21 p.m.
 
 Compared with the the prior film, there has been considerable interval
 improvement in the asymmetric opacities which were predominantly seen in the
 right lung.  Faint residua remains visible.  Mild ___ B-type lines at the
 left base and thickening of the minor fissure is still seen, but much less
 pronounced.  There is only mild residual upper zone redistribution. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, with cardiomegaly, left
 ventricular configuration and slightly unfolded aorta.  Small posterior
 effusions remain visible.
 
 There appears to be background COPD, with hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms
 and mild prominence of both pulmonary arteries, with a tapered appearance,
 which could reflect the presence of pulmonary hypertension.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considerable clearing of previously seen opacities.  Despite the
 asymmetry, this suggests that this was, in great part, if not completely, due
 to CHF.  However, note is made that there is subtle residual opacity seen in
 the right upper and mid zones.  This should be followed to confirm resolution.
