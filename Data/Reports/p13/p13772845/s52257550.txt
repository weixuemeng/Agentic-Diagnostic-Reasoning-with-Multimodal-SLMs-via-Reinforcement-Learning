                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and cough, persistent rhonchi, left
 upper lobe pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Moderate widening and elongation of the thoracic
 aorta is noted, however, no local contour abnormalities or wall calcifications
 are identified.  A retrocardiac rounded structure in the lower mediastinum
 most likely represents hiatal hernia.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic
 character can be identified.  There exists, however, a general attenuation of
 the pulmonary peripheral vasculature in combination with a translucent
 appearance of the lungs, preferentially on the basis where the diaphragms are
 relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened.  All these described
 findings raise the possibility of COPD.  Again, there is no evidence of any
 acute parenchymal infiltrates, particularly in the left upper lobe area as
 suspected on the requisition.  The lateral view discloses generally
 demineralized vertebral bodies in the thoracic spine but no conclusive
 evidence for any vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pneumonia, but findings suggestive of COPD
 and moderately sized hiatal hernia.
