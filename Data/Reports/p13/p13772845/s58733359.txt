                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen relative lucency of the upper lungs in comparison to the more
 inferior lungs may be due to underlying COPD.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Again seen rounded
 retrocardiac structure on the frontal view most likely relates to a hiatal
 hernia.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
