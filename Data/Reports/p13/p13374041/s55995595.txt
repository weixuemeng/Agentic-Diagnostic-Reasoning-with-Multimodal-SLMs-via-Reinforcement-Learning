                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of sarcoid and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The previously
 seen right apical nodular scarring is again demonstrated on this study and is
 associated with some upward retraction of the right hilus.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no focal area of
 pneumonia, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.  There is mild scoliosis of
 the thoracic spine and surgical clips are again seen at the gastroesophageal
 junction, unchanged in position since the prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
