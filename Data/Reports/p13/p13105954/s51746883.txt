                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and acute on chronic neck and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  Allowing
 for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is again
 calcification of the aortic knob. No focal consolidation is identified. 
 Streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis or scarring.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis or scarring. No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia, but dedicated PA and lateral chest
 radiographs would provide more complete assessment of the lung bases and may
 be helpful if clinical suspicion for infection persists.
