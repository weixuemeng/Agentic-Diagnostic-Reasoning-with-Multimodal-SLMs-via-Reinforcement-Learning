                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with generalized weakness on top of chronic
 neurologic deficits of bilateral lower extremities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Cardiac silhouette
 size remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is not substantially changed in
 the interval.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Hypertrophic changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to that seen on the prior study,
 without focal consolidation.
