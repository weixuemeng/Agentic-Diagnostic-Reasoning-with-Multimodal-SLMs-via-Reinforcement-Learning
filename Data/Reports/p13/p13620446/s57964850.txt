                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracic myelopathy with weakness.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided port terminates with the tip at the upper SVC.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is again noted.  There are bilateral increased interstitial
 opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  Additionally, increased
 retrocardiac opacities are noted and may represent focal atelectasis or an
 early developing infectious process.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the
 thoracic spine 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacities are again noted and may represent atelectasis.  However, an
 concurrent infectious process has to be excluded in the proper clinical
 setting.  
 
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly again noted.
