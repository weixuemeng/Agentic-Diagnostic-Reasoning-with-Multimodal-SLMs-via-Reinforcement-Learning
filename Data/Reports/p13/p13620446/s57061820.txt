                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy better assessed on the
 previous CT.  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 upper SVC, unchanged.  Hilar contours are similar with mild enlargement
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension as noted previously. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy and
 enlargement of the pulmonary arteries better assessed on the previous CT.
