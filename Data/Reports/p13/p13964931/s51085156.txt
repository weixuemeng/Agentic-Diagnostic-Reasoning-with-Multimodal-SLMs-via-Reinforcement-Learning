                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pyelonephritis and renal obstruction status post
 nephrostomy, now with leukocytosis and cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low.  There is increased
 opacification at the lung bases, left greater than the right.  The
 costophrenic angles are blunted, compatible with small pleural effusions,
 greater on the left.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette
 is incompletely evaluated.  The mediastinal contours appear prominent, which
 is related in part to technique.  Within the right upper abdomen, a
 percutaneous nephrostomy tube is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema is
 compatible with fluid overload.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left , most likely reflect
 atelectasis.
