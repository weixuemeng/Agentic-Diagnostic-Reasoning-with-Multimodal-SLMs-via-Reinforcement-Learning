                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 858
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Gram-negative rod bacteremia with
 aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Evaluate for acute process, pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 929 as well
 as selected images from a chest CT dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 858 is submitted.
 
 Biapical linear opacities are again seen consistent with scarring.  There has
 been interval appearance of bibasilar opacities which could reflect patchy
 atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
