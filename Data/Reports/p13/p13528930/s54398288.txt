 HISTORY:  Amiodarone, to assess for toxicity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged without evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Specifically, no
 interstitial prominence to suggest amiodarone toxicity radiographically.
