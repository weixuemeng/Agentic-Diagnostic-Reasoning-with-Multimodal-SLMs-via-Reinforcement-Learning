                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date as well as previous chest
 radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. 
 Previously present homogeneous opacity along the left upper mediastinum has
 resolved, and likely reflected left upper lobe collapse.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by mild-to-moderate edema as well as bilateral
 pleural effusions, small on the right and small to moderate on the left.  No
 definite pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.
