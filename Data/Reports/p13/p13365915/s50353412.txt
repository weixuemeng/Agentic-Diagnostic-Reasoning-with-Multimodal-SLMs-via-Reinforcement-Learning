                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of
 an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.  Right
 IJ catheter has been removed.  There is continued retrocardiac opacification
 with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss and
 possible small effusion.  The right base is now essentially clear.
