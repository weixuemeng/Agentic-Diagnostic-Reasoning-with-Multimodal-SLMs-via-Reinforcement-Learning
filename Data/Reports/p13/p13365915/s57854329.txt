                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 Exam is limited by exclusion of the periphery of the right lung from the study
 and by the presence of multiple external monitoring leads which obscure
 underlying lung and mediastinal detail.  Endotracheal tube remains in place,
 but tip is not confidently located due to obscuration of this region by
 overlying external leads.  Repeat radiograph following removal or
 re-positioning of leads is advised.  Overall appearance of the chest is
 otherwise similar to recent radiograph of ___ when consideration is
 made for marked patient rotation on the current study.
