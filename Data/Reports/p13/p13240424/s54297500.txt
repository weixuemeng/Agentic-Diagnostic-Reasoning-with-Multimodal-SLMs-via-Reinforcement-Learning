                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with amphetamine use, dyspnea  // eval for cause of
 dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base most
 likely represents minimal atelectasis.
 
 An ovoid area of lucency is seen abutting the left side of the trachea,
 immediately above the aortic arch, measuring ___.7 x ___.6 mm.  This is not
 fully characterized, but may represent a bulla or bleb in the medial portion
 of the left lung.
 
 A 5.6 mm focal density overlying the anterior left third and posterior left
 fifth ribs may represent artifact due to overlying rib shadows.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity right lung base, likely representing minimal atelectasis.  An
 early pneumonic infiltrate area of aspiration is considered less likely.
 
 Vertical ovoid lucency along the left trachea--___ full or bleb in the
 medial left lung.
 
 5.6 mm density overlying left lung laterally --?  Artifact due to overlapping
 rib shadows.  If clinically indicated, oblique views of the chest could help
 for further assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 5.6 mm density overlying left lung laterally --? Artifact due to overlapping
 rib shadows. If clinically indicated, oblique views of the chest could help
 for further assessment.
