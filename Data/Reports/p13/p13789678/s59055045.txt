                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation urosepsis, evaluate for interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 5.1 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 Left IJ central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  Prominence of the
 tracheal air shadow again noted.
 
 There is background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  There is perihilar
 opacity with air bronchograms as well as additional opacity extending to the
 right upper zone and to a lesser extent in left upper zone.  There is also
 dense opacity at both lung bases, possibly with small effusions.  This may
 represent  CHF, but the possibility of a superimposed pneumonic consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable worsening of CHF findings compared with ___ at 1:13
 a.m.  New bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation possibly with small
 effusions.  Possibility of superimposed pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.
