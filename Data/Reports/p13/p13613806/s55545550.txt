                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  New shortness of breath.  Patient with history of right
 thoracotomy, diaphragmatic tumor resection and right lower lobe wedge
 resection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is elongated.  Port-A-Cath is in
 standard position.  There is a decreasing small right effusion.  Right lower
 lobe atelectasis has markedly improved.  The left lung is grossly clear. 
 Atelectasis in the right middle lobe has also improved.
 
 On the lateral view, there appear to be tiny focal areas of air-fluid levels,
 which suggests the presence of a small pneumothorax associated with a small
 effusion.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 4:33 p.m.,
 two minutes after the discovery of the finding.
