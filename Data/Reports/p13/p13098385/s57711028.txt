 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Biventricular pacing device remains in place, unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Extensive calcified
 pleural thickening in the right hemithorax with adjacent parenchymal scarring
 also appears similar.  Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.  If clinical
 suspicion for lymphoma is high, consider a dedicated chest CT.
