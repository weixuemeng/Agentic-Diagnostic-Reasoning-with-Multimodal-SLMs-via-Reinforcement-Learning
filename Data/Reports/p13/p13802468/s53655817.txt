                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation for ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the endotracheal tube and the right chest tube, are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  In unchanged manner, there is a left
 pleural effusion visualized together with left basal areas of atelectasis. 
 The lung volume on the right is slightly reduced, with atelectasis seen at the
 very right lung bases.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Several, very subtle ill-defined parenchymal opacities on the right, with air
 bronchograms, could be reflecting hyperpermeability edema in an early stage.
