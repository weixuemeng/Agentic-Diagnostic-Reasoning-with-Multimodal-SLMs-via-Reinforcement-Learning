                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with leg swelling and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Is moderately enlarged, accentuated by the low lung volumes. Similarly,
 widening of the superior mediastinum and crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures are due to low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema is present.
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis
 though infection cannot be completely excluded.
