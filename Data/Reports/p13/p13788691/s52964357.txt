                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hallucinations and advanced ___'s disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unremarkable aside from mild unfolding along the descending
 thoracic aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky medial
 left basilar atelectasis is most consistent with minor atelectasis.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.  The bones appear demineralized.  Vertebroplasties
 have been performed along four lower thoracic spinal levels, not completely
 assessed.  Immediately above these, there is a mild loss in height of a
 vertebral body, but not necessarily acute and difficult to assess.  Prior
 fractures involve the right posterior lateral sixth and seventh ribs, and
 probably eighth rib, without displacement.  On the left, no fracture is
 identified.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
