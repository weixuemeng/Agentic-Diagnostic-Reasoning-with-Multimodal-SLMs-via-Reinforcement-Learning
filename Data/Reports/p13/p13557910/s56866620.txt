                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax, in a patient with a foreign body in
 the neck.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates normal cardiac size
 and a tortuous thoracic aorta, with clips along the left mediastinum. The
 lungs are hyperinflated with chronic appearing changes particularly in the
 right.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles
 suggests small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax identified.
 2. Hyperinflated lungs with chronic appearing changes suggesting COPD.
 3. Possible small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
