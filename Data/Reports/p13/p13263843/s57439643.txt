                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again extensive
 post-surgical changes in the right hemithorax with elevation of the
 hemidiaphragm with tenting as well as displacement of the trachea to the
 right.  The degree of right effusion has decreased.  The left lung is
 essentially clear, though there is again prominence of interstitial markings
 consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Central line
 remains in place.
