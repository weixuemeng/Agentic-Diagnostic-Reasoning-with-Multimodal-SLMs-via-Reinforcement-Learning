                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and lung cancer as well as throat cancer.  Also
 with history of sleep apnea.  Presenting with productive cough.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Chronic deformity of the upper right thorax relates to prior chest wall
 resection.  Suture chain along the right perihilar region is consistent with
 prior right upper lobectomy, as is right apical scarring and superior
 retraction of the right hilus.  There is also suture chain noted along the
 lateral aspect of the upper right lung.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 There is no definite right pleural effusion.  Scarring is seen at the right
 lung base, not significantly changed.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Chronic post-surgical changes of the right lung and chest wall, as
 described above.
