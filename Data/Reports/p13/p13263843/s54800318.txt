                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of lung cancer and recurrent pneumonia,
 on followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There has been interval progression of consolidation in the right lung,
 consistent with worsening of right lung multifocal pneumonia.  Patient has
 known collapse of the right middle lobe.  Multiple spiculated lung nodules in
 the left lung are better seen in prior CT.  Opacities in the left lower lobe
 have minimally increased.  Small left pleural effusion has increased.  Right
 large pleural effusion is probably unchanged, though difficult to evaluate. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormalities on
 the right.  Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.
