                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, CHF and effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison study of ___, there is again extensive opacification
 involving much of the right hemithorax.  This is consistent with a previous
 study showing substantial loculation of right pleural fluid collection with
 underlying extensive volume loss.
 
 Prominence of markings on the left most likely represents redistribution of
 blood flow to non-aerated regions on the right.
