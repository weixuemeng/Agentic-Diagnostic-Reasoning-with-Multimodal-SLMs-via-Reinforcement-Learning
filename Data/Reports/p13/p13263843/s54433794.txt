                                 FINAL REPORT
 In comparison with the study of ___, the extensive postoperative changes
 are again seen in the right hemithorax.  Upward retraction of the right
 hemidiaphragm with extensive fibrotic change is seen, as well as opacification
 in the elevated right hilar region that could reflect previous radiation
 therapy.  Osseous changes are again seen in the upper right ribs.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
