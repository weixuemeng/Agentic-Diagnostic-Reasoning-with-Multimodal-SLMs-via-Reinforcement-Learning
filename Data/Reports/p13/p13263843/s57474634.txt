                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with
 volume loss suggesting extensive coinciding parenchymal atelectasis,
 substantially increased since the prior studies.  There is a persistent patchy
 left basilar opacity, but with general improvement in aeration of the left
 lower lobe and resolution of a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A mild interstitial abnormality in each lung suggests mild
 fluid overload.  Post-operative changes are noted along the right chest wall
 including rib deformities, as seen previously.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial increase in right-sided pleural effusion with volume
 loss.
