                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with likely pneumonia at outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest.  Postoperative changes again seen in the right
 thoracic cavity.  Compared to prior, there appears to be less aerated lung on
 the right which could be due to enlarging effusion with possible underlying
 parenchymal abnormality.  In addition, there is persistent left basilar
 opacity not significantly changed given differences in technique.  Superiorly,
 the left lung remains clear.  Right PICC and right pleural catheter are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent left basilar opacity, compared to ___.  This could
 represent atelectasis although infection is not excluded.  
 
 2.  Less aerated lung on the right when compared to prior, potentially due to
 collecting pleural fluid although developing parenchymal abnormalities are
 also possible.
