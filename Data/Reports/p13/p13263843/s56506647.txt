                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobectomy with effusion and pigtail catheter, status
 post bronchoscopy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change in the degree of aeration of the lungs.  Some suggested
 increased opacification at the left costophrenic angle could reflect some
 increasing effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Evidence of prior right
 upper lobe lobectomy and radiation therapy, better demonstrated on recent CT
 scan.
