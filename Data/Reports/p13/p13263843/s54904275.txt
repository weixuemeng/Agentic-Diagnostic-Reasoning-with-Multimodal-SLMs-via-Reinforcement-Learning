                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD, status post right upper lobectomy for lung cancer
 presenting with recurrent pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as a CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is notable interval improvement in the right pleural
 effusion.  There is a dense opacification with a rounded contour below the
 aerated right residual lung.  Though the contour has the appearance of an
 elevated right hemidiaphragm, this appears to represent a large subpulmonic
 effusion when compared to ___ chest CT.  There is improved aeration
 of the right lung with residual opacifications likely representing combination
 of atelectasis and known malignancy; cannot exclude superimposed infectious
 process.  Atelectatic changes are noted within the left lower lung with a
 slightly greater degree of collapse in the posterior medial subsegment.  Small
 left pleural effusion identified.  Abnormal contour of the right upper
 mediastinum is consistent with known malignancy.  Left-sided cardiomediastinal
 borders are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval mild improvement in right pleural effusion with likely a
 large residual subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Dense opacifications in the now
 apparent right residual lung likely represents a combination of atelectasis
 and known malignancy.  Small left pleural effusion.
