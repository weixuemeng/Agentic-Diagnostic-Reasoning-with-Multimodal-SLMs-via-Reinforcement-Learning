                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CTA chest, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Postsurgical changes of a right upper lobectomy and right upper rib
 resection are unchanged.  Radiation changes are stable.  There is associated
 volume loss with elevation and tenting of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
 atelectasis of the right middle lobe, unchanged from prior exams.  The
 previously seen right lower lobe nodular opacities have improved since the
 prior studies in ___.  There is no new opacification.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted
 rightward due to volume loss, but otherwise normal in shape and contour.  The
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable post-surgical and post-radiation changes of the right lung.
 2.  Interval improvement of previously seen right lower lobe opacification.
 3.  No new opacity, effusion, or pneumothorax.
