                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF, BrCa p/w dyspnea and chest pain  // pulm
 edema vs. infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable and stable.  There is
 increase in pulmonary vasculature bilaterally suggesting mild interstitial
 edema, increased as compared to the prior study.  Difficult to exclude
 underlying pulmonary nodule, and if this is of clinical concern, chest CT is
 more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial edema.  Mild cardiomegaly.
