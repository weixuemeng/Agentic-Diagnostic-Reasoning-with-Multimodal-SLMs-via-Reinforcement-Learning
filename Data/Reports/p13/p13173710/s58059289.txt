                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of congestive heart failure with
 symptoms consistent with past exacerbations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is mild upper zone vascular
 redistribution without overt pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in the lung
 bases are are compatible with areas of subsegmental atelectasis.  Evaluation
 of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by the soft tissues of the neck
 projecting over this region.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
