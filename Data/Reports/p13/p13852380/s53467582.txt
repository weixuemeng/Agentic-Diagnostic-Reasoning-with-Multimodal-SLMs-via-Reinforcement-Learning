                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever, cough and volume depletion.  Question
 for having left lower lobe pneumonia on ___:
 
 There has not been much change.  The upper lungs nearly to the level of the
 diaphragm are clear.  There is some bronchovascular crowding in the lower
 lungs which would make it impossible to exclude a small pneumonia, but if
 there is strong clinical evidence for that I would supplement these views with
 oblique projections.  Pulmonary vasculature is borderline engorged.  Heart
 size is top normal, but there is no edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
