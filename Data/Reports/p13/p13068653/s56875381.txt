                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:46 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with interstitial lung disease, evaluate for
 pneumonia, CHF or ARDS.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs, in
 conjunction with a chest CT on ___,
 
 Interstitial pulmonary infiltration is severe.  Heart is severely enlarged and
 mediastinal veins are engorged.  Having said that, I cannot tell whether there
 is a component of pulmonary edema, or even pneumonia without looking at prior
 chest radiographs to detect subtle changes.  Pleural effusions are small if
 any.  No pneumothorax.
