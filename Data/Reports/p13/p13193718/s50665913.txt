                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous, and the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is present as a result of low lung volumes. A small to moderate
 size right pleural effusion is demonstrated with associated right basilar
 opacity, likely compressive atelectasis. Patchy left basilar opacity also may
 be reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. No displaced
 fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Small to moderate size right pleural effusion with
 bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection or aspiration
 is not completely excluded.
