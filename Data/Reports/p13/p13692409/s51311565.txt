                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, wheeze, O2 requirement. Eval for
 interval change.  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 15:53 and allowing for considerable differences
 in positioning.
 
 The right cardiophrenic region is better seen, which could reflect either
 differences in positioning course some improved aeration.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears less prominent, but this is probably
 due to differences in positioning. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 enlarged, with prominent anterior and what is thought to be descending aorta
 contours.   The possibility of pulmonary artery enlargement cannot be
 excluded. There is upper zone redistribution with diffuse blurring and
 interstitial and some alveolar edema. No gross effusion. Bibasilar patchy
 opacities.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. CHF with pulmonary edema.
 2. Bibasilar patchy opacities. Possible slight improvement at the right base,
 but I suspect this is predominantly due to differences in positioning.
 3. Moderately severe cardiomegaly. The aorta and pulmonary arteries are likely
 enlarged.  The possibility of aneurysmal enlargement is difficult to exclude
 on this film. If clinically indicated, CT could help to better identify the
 structures that account for the mediastinal enlargement, including precise
 ___ of the aorta and pulmonary arteries. (Review of the abdominal CT
 from ___ shows that the caliber of the descending aorta below the
 level of the heart itself is not enlarged.)
