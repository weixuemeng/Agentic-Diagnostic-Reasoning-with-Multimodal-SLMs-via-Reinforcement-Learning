                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Prominence of central pulmonary vascularity
 is unchanged.  The lungs are clear.  Bilateral bronchial wall thickening is
 present and is more conspicuous than on the prior study.  Focal pleural
 thickening at right costophrenic sulcus laterally appears unchanged.  No acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Bronchial wall thickening, which could reflect bronchitis in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 3.  Enlarged central pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
