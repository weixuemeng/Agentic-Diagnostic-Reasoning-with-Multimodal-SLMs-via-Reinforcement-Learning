                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:09 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Possible pulmonary edema in intubated patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. 
 Ground-glass opacification in both lungs, right greater than left is certainly
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  Although heart size is normal, the
 configuration suggests left atrial enlargement and central pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged suggesting elevated left atrial pressure.  Pleural
 effusion is small, on the right.  No pneumothorax.
