                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary edema in patient
 requiring intervention during gynecologic operation for presumed flash
 pulmonary edema and a history of HIV.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and older studies from
 ___ and as far back as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
 bilateral diffuse opacities, consistent with stable mild pulmonary edema.  The
 lung volumes are lower on today's study, exaggerating heart size.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is also seen.
 An endotracheal tube once again terminates no less than 3 cm above the carina.
 An orogastric tube courses to the stomach and inferiorly below the field of
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild pulmonary edema, without appreciable vascular
 engorgement or cardiomegaly, raises suspicion of noncardiogenic causes.  Given
 the patient's history of HIV, and the similar radiographic appearance of
 atypical pneumonia, this finding should be correlated with clinical symptoms
 of infection, and followed closely with follow-up radiographs.
