                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Bronchovascular
 markings are prominent, likely due to low lung volumes.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  The heart size is top normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Linear opacity projecting over right lung apex is likely
 external to the patient.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
