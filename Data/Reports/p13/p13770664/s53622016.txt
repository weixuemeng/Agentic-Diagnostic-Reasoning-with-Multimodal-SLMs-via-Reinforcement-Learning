                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Calcified lymph nodes are present in the right
 hilar region as well as a calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe.  Patchy
 opacity in left retrocardiac region is new, and may reflects patchy
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Acute aspiration is an
 additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.  Note is also
 made of apparent rightward deviation of the trachea, at the level of the
 thoracic inlet.  This is difficult to evaluate on a portable radiograph,
 particularly as the patient's neck appears to be turned towards the right on
 this exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Apparent rightward deviation of trachea. Repeat radiograph with
 the neck in neutral position may be helpful to differentiate the effects of
 rotation from tracheal displacement from a fixed abnormality such as an
 adjacent thyroid mass.
