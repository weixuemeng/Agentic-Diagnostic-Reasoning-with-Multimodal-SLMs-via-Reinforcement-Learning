                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart is probably at the upper
 limits of normal in size allowing for low lung volumes and AP technique.  The
 lungs appear clear, although soft tissue attenuation limits assessment of the
 lung bases.  Old right-sided healed rib fractures are suggested along the
 right fifth and sixth ribs.  Small osteophytes are noted throughout the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
