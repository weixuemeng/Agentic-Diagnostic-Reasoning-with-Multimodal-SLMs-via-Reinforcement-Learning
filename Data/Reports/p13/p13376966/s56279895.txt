                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever and hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 18:58.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 9:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Left costophrenic angle not entirely included.  Despite the
 low lung volumes, however, there is increasing fullness and indistinctness to
 the pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  A more focal
 opacity at the retrocardiac region may reflect patchy atelectasis.  Aspiration
 or pneumonia would be also in the differential.  No pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable given portable technique.
