                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with worsening respiratory status.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The head partially obscures the apices.  A left pacer has a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged re-demonstrating severe cardiomegaly.  A moderate to large
 left pleural effusion and a moderate right pleural effusion are unchanged. 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is similarly unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly, large left and moderate right pleural effusions, and mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema are unchanged and consistent with known CHF.
