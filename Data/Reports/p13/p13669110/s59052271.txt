                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CHEST, 2 VWS
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The lungs are probable hyperinflated.  There is moderate to moderately severe
 cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidece of
 CHF.  On the right, there is pleural fluid and/or thickening, with underlying
 patchy opacity. Undulating vertical linear opacity along the right chest wall
 is thought to represent some scarring and/or calcification along the
 pleural-parenchymal interface. On the left, there is slight retrocardiac
 opacity.  No left effusion. 
 
 A well-marginated right hilar opacity likely represenrs an enlarged right
 pulmonary artery.  The left hilum is obscured by overlying structures, but not
 clearly enlarged.
 
 Partially imaged left shoulder prosthesis noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right base and retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia and/or
 atelectasis, with associated small right pleural effusion. This is of
 indeterminate acuity.  Probable scarring at the pleural-parenchymal interface
 along the right chest wall -- has there been prior trauma or instrumentation?
 
 2.  Moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Right hilar enlargement -- please see comment above.
