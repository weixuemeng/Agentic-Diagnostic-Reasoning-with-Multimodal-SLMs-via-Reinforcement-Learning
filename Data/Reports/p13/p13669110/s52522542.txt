                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and history of CHF and COPD, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left and small right pleural effusions, moderately severe
 pulmonary edema, andsevere chronic cardiomegaly are all increased. Bibasilar
 atelectasis has worsened. The left pleural effusion is large enough to obscure
 any abnormality in the left lower chest, including a lower thoracic aortic
 aneurysm or lung mass as suggested on the lateral view.  Chest radiographs
 should be repeated after treatment of heart failure.   No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Single-lead pacemaker is unchanged.  Left shoulder prosthesis is
 incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe heart failure, worsened.  Followup chest radiographs
 should be obtained after treatment to exclude mass or aneurysm in the left
 chest.
