                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M ped struck w/ RUL collapse  // Interval change. Please
 perform at AM TSICU rounds.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, right upper lobe collapse
 persists.  Remainder of lungs are clear except for a new left retrocardiac
 opacity, likely due to atelectasis.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for slightly
 proximal position of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 6.8 cm above the
 carina.  This can be advanced a few cm for standard positioning.
