 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes accentuate transverse
 diameter of the heart. There is increased opacification at both bases, more
 prominent on the right. Although this could well represent areas of
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical situation superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be seriously considered.
