                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe ___'s and aspiration history.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles seen on the lateral
 view, raising concern for trace pleural effusions.  Left mid lung
 atelectasis/scarring is seen.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Streaky right base opacity, best seen on the frontal view, may in part relate
 to vascular congestion, however, underlying consolidation from aspiration or
 infection is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes are partially imaged at
 the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles seen on the lateral view could
 be due to trace pleural effusions.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Patchy right base opacity may be partly due to vascular congestion, underlying
 consolidation from aspiration or infection not excluded.
