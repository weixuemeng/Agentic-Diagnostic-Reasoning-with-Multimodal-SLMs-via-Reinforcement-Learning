                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for pleural effusion or
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right MediPort terminates in the low SVC. The lung volumes are exceedingly
 low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, as a result of the extensive hepatic
 metastases, with overlying atelectasis. Asymmetric opacity throughout the left
 lung is noted.  No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are tiny, if any. Heart is
 normal size. The mediastinum is not widened. The stomach is moderately
 distended with air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric interstitial opacity throughout the left lung is non-specific but
 may reflect asymmetric edema, aspiration or infection.  Please refer to
 same-day abdominopelvic CT for further details.
