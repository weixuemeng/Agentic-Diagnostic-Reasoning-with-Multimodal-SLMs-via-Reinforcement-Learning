 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for the AP portable
 technique, there is probably little overall change.  There is elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragmatic contour with blunting of the costophrenic angle,
 possibly related to the extensive surgical fixation of previous fracture
 dislocation of the proximal left humerus.  No definite vascular congestion or
 acute focal pneumonia or pneumothorax.
