                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with likely hypoglycemic seizure  // eval for acute
 process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Supine AP portable views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum may relate to supine
 position and AP technique along with low lung volumes, however, there is
 clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, contrast-enhanced chest CT
 would be the study of choice.  The cardiac silhouette appears top-normal to
 mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by low lung volumes, supine position, and
 AP technique.  No displaced fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the superior mediastinum may relate to supine position and AP
 technique along with low lung volumes, however, if there is clinical concern
 for acute mediastinal injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 No focal consolidation.
