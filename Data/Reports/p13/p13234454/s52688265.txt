                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT chest ___. 
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Hazy opacity at the right lung base likely atelectasis, though
 pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar structures unremarkable.  There is
 no evidence for pneumomediastinum.
