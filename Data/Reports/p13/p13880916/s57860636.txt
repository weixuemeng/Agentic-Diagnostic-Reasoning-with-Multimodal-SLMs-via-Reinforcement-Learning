                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, poor po intake
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Midline air
 filled structure projects over the cervical trachea, and may reflect a
 markedly distended esophagus with air-fluid level.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Midline air filled structure projecting over the trachea, potentially a
 dilated esophagus with air-fluid level. Lateral view of the chest is
 recommended for further assessment. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
