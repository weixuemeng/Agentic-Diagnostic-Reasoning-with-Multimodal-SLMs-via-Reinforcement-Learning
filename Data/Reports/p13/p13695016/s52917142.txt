  Right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in low SVC.  Increased right
  lung base opacity may represent increased moderate right pleural effusion . 
  Increased mild left lung base opacity is probably secondary to atelectasis,
  however pneumonia is possible in correct clinical setting.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right
 internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip of the catheter projects over the
 right atrium.  Unchanged evidence of low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 and a right pleural effusion, combines to a right basal parenchymal opacity. 
 No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
