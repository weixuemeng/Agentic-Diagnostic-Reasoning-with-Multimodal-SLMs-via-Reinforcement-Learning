                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest radiograph from an outside facility dated ___ at 21:38.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity is new since ___ and more prominent ___, which could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. 
 Persistent right small pleural effusion, overall unchanged.  Right lower and
 middle lobe atelectasis with mild downward displacement of the minor fissure
 and hila.  Increased left lower lobe and retrocardiac opacity since ___, with new indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm, is probably secondary
 to atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly, overall unchanged.  There is probably also
 a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity may reflect a combination of atelectasis and
 pneumonia/aspiration.
 2.  Chronic small right pleural effusion and likely smaller left pleural
 effusion.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.
 4.  Right greater than left atelectasis.
