                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p dual chamber ICD.  // assess lead placement
 and r/o PTx.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The newly placed left pacemaker defibrillator has 1 tip in the right atrium
 the other in the expected region of right ventricle.  A right IJ catheter tip
 projects over the expected region of the proximal right atrium, unchanged. 
 Lung volumes remain low.  A large right pleural effusion with compressive
 atelectasis has slightly increased in the interim.  Left pleural effusion with
 compressive atelectasis appears to increased in the interim.  There may be a
 tiny right apical pneumothorax.  No evidence of tension.  Cardiomegaly,
 unchanged.

 atelectasis.
 3.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
