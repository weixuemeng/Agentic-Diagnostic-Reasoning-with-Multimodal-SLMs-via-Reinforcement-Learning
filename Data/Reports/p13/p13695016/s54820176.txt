                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with orthopnea, history of ESRD on peritoneal
 dialysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Mild to moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette
 is re- demonstrated, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar,
 and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small to moderate size
 bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, appear not substantially
 changed in the interval.  There is associated bibasilar airspace opacities,
 likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  Degenerative
 changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the
 right.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of compressive
 atelectasis.
