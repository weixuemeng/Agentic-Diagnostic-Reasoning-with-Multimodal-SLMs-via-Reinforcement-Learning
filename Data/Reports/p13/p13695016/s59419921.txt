  1. Persistent, stable right pleural effusion since ___.  Adjacent
  right lower and middle lobe relaxation atelectasis. Note, although unchanged
  in appearance, it would be difficult to evaluate for superimposed infectious
  process in this location.
  2. Possible residual trace left pleural effusion, although considerably
  smaller since prior.
  3. No focal lung consolidation elsewhere.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___-year-old man with epigastric pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right pleural effusion with relaxation atelectasis of the
 adjacent right lower and right middle lobes.  There may be a minimal trace
 residual left pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Aside from right basal atelectasis, the
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
