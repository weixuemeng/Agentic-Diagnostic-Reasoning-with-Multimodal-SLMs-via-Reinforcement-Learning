                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There are moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, greater on the right than left.  Associated parenchymal
 opacities are most likely compatible with atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No frank pulmonary edema is seen.  Small osteophytes are noted
 throughout the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
