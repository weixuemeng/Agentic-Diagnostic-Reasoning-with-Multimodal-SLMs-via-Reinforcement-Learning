                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are grossly clear.  No good
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Old bilateral rib fractures are
 noted.  There is probably a degree of bronchial wall thickening in both
 apices, particularly in the right side, which may reflect old granulomatous
 change.  There is not, however, any good evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  Severe degenerative changes in the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic changes, right apex.
