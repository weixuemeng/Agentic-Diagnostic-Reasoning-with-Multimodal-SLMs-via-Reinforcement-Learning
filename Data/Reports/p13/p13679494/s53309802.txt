                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of psychiatric,
 presents with hallucinations, cough and strange breathing, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 subtle small area of left base opacity which could be due to artifact,
 although an underlying early consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.  The
 right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small very subtle focus of increased density at the left lung
 base may be artifactual, but in the appropriate clinical setting, early/mild
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Remainder of the lung fields is clear.
