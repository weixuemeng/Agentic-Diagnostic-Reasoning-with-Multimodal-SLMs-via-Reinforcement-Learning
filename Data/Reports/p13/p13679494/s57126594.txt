 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain for one week, evaluation for acute process.

 projection artifact, if chest pain persists, the patient should undergo CT to
 exclude the presence of a mediastinal abnormality.  No acute changes, in
 particular no pneumonia, no pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.  Normal
 size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 At the time of observation, 8:54 a.m., on the ___, the
