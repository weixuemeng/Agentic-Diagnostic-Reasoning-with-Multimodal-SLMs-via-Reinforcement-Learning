                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Multiple rib fractures, assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Rib fractures are
 only partially seen on the current study.  The hyperinflation of the chest is
 noted, better on the lateral view associated with substantial kyphosis.
