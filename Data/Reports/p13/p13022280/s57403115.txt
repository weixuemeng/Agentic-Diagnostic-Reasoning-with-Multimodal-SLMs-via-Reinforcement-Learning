 of the stomach with the side port below the GE junction.  There is patchy
 opacity projecting over the right lung base.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube tip terminates at the carina with the tip oriented towards the
 right main bronchus.  Recommend withdrawing by 2-3 cm.
 
 2. Patchy opacity in right lung base, likely due to atelectasis or aspiration.
