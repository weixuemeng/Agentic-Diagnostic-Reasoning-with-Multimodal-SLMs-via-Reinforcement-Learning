                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Extreme posterior portion of the chest is excluded from
 the lateral view.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD. Heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is detected.  The aortic contour is within normal limits. 
 Smooth, hazy soft tissue density in the right paratracheal region likely
 reflects the silhouette of the SVC, together with mediastinal fat.
 
 No CHF, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Incidental note is made of ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament
 of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.  Background hyperinflation noted.
