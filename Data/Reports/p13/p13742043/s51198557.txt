                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman in atrial fibrillation.  Question opacity
 projecting over the atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 3-cm wide oval opacity, angulate to the upper right atrium more right hilus. 
 I would recommend a CT scan for localization.  Heart size is normal. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and the lungs are clear, though
 hyperinflated.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any.  Emphysema or severe small
 airways obstruction is presumed.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads are in standard positions.  Granulomatous
 calcifications are present in both hila.
