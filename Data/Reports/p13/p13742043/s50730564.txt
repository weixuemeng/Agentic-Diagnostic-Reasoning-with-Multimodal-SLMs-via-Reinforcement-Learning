                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Rounded opacity projecting over the region of the right atrium measuring
 approximately 2 cm could potentially be within the lungs.  Remainder of the
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 2 cm nodular opacity projecting over the right atrium.  Lateral view is
 recommended to better delineate the location of this finding.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
