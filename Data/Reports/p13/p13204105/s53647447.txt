                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of COPD and recent stroke, now with
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs.
 Again seen is pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral pleural effusions
 and compressive atelectasis.  Cardiomegaly is again seen.  There is no gross
 change since the prior imaging.  Slightly improved transparency of the lungs
 on this exam is likely attributable to this being a PA view compared to
 previous AP portable images.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and
 still demonstrates cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged chest radiograph.
