 Heart size is moderately enlarged with a large hiatal hernia noted, increased

 are otherwise unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Atelectasis is seen in the left lung base.  No pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Multiple compression deformities
 are seen within the lower thoracic spine, new from the previous examinations,
 but likely chronic in age.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Large hiatal hernia.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Interval development of chronic appearing lower thoracic vertebral body
 compression deformities and remote left-sided rib fractures.
