 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes have diminished and there is persistent elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm which presumably is chronic. Interval appearance of patchy
 opacity in the right mid and lower lung which could reflect an area of
 aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation. 
 No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Incompletely visualized spinal hardware
 overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. Clips in the right upper
 quadrant consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
