                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia.  Eval pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable AP views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ common ___ ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip is 2.7 cm above the carina, unchanged.  The NG tube
 and left IJ line tip in the lower SVC are unchanged.
 
 Since the prior radiograph, the right lung volume is lower, producing at least
 atelectasis. However, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to a
 subpulmonic effusion. Pneumonia cannot be ruled out. A skin fold projecting
 over the left apex should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. There is no
 focal left lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease of the right lung volume, producing at least atelectasis.
 There may be a right pleural effusion, evidenced by a right hemidiaphragm
 elevation. Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
