 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with nasogastric tube for shortness of breath,
 to assess for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest single view was read in comparison with
 prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Orogastric tube ends into the stomach; however, its distal end is looped. 
 Minimal bibasilar opacity is probably atelectasis.  No discrete opacities
 concerning for pneumonia.  The heart size is top normal, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse soft tissue opacity in the left upper
 mediastinum and tracheal deviation to the right side,  probably from
 multinodular goiter is longstanding and stable.  No pleural effusion.
