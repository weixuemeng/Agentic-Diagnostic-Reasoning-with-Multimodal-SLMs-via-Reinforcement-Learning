 tachypnea, new O2 requirement  // eval ? infiltrate, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There are low lung volumes
 which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this, there appears to
 be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear left base opacity most likely
 represents atelectasis, however, infection is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
