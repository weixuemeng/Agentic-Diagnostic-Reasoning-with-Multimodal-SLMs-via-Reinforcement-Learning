                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall with rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There may be
 minimal left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  Projecting over the posterior mid-to-lower thoracic
 vertebral body, again seen is a 0.9-cm density which appears minimally
 superior in relation to the vertebral body as compared to the prior study and
 could represent a calcified granuloma.  Chest CT is pending and this can be
 confirmed on that study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
