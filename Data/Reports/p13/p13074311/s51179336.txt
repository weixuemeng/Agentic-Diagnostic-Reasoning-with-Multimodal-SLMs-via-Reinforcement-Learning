                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following
 bronchoscopy, there is little change in the opacification in the retrocardiac
 region consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
