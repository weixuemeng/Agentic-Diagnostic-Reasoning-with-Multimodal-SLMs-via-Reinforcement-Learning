                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation with possible infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes remain in place.  Retrocardiac opacification again most
 likely reflects atelectasis, possibly with effusion.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The right lung is
 essentially clear.
