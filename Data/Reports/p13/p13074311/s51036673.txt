                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for
 patient's positional differences.  Unchanged left retrocardiac opacity which
 may be due to atelectasis and/or consolidation, as well as an adjacent
 moderate left pleural effusion.  Note is also made of previous left mastectomy
 and axillary lymph node dissection.  Prominent carotid artery calcifications
 are present in the imaged portion of the neck.
