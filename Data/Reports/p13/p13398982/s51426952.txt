                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia with medical noncompliance, fevers.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Multiple mediastinal clips are again noted.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is re- demonstrated, and likely
 reflective of the patient's pneumonia, as demonstrated on the prior CT. 
 Calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe is unchanged.  Right lung is
 otherwise clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe compatible with pneumonia as seen on the
 prior CT.
