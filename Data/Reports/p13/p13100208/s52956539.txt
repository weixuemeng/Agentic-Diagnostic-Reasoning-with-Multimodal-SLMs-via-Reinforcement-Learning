 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post stroke, evaluation for nasogastric tube placement.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
 tube is not included in the image but the side hole projects approximately 8
 cm below the gastroesophageal junction.  There is no evidence of complication,
 notably no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, unchanged radiographic appearance.
