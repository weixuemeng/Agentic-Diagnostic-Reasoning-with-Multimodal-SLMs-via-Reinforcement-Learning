                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and wheezing.  Evaluate for etiology and infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are exceedingly low,
 limiting evaluation and resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Within the limitations of this exam, there is no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
