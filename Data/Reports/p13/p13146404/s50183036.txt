                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD exacerbation and
 suspected possible pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is still redemonstration of the
 right perihilar minimal opacities that potentially can represent mild focus of
 pneumonia, but no progression since the prior study noted.  Rest of the lungs
 are hyperinflated but clear.  Pleural thickening is noted on the right, but no
 new development of pleural effusion is present.
