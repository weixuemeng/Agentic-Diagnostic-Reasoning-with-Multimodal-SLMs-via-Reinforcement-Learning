                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 11:35
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD and now being treated for right
 lower lobe pneumonia, assess for pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 15:31.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 11:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is marked interval improvement with resolution of the pulmonary
 edema, although there is residual subtle patchy opacity at the right lung base
 which could represent resolving asymmetric pulmonary edema, although pneumonia
 could also have this appearance.  Clinical correlation is advised.  The lungs
 appear hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
