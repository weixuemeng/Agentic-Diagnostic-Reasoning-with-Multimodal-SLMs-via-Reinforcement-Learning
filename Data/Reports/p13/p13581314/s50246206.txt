 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p syncopal epsidoe striking head while voiding, imaging
 initially showed high frontal tSAH and repeat with R temporal contusion  //
 syncopal wioth pleuritic chest pain     syncopal wioth pleuritic chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum, and pleural surfaces.  No evidence of
 intrathoracic malignancy or infection.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such
 abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
