 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:27 PM
  Curvilinear opacity in the left lung base with underlying lucency could
  represent atelectasis or air within the stomach given the location of the NG
  tube.  However given question of pneumoperitoneum per requisition (though not
  on clinical exam per Dr. ___), recommend repeat radiographs with better
  inspiration or lateral decubitus view.  
  
  Dr. ___ ___/w Dr. ___ via phone ___ at ___ pm, 5 minutes after
  discovery of the findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain, NG lavage.  Please evaluate for free air.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip lies immediately beneath the left hemidiaphragm
 associated with a small area of air immediately deep to the left
 hemi-diaphragm.  No well-defined stomach contour is visible and the air
 beneath the left hemidiaphragm could either lie within stomach or bowel or
 could represent free air. No other evidence of free air is detected.  
 
 Compared with abdominal films from ___, there has been considerable
 improvement in the degree of small bowel distention, with no frankly dilated
 loops appreciated on this film.   Surgical clips and suspected pacratic
 calcifications again noted. 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips. Bibasilar
 atelectasis is present.  No CHF or pneumothorax is detected.    There is
 slight blunting of right-greater-than-left costophrenic angles, consistent
 with a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening.  Thoracic spine
 degenerative change is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  NG tube tip lies immediately beneath left hemidiaphragm.  Air seen there
 likely may lie within the stomach or bowel, but the possibility of a small
 area of free intra-abdominal air at that site cannot be completely excluded. 
 As per the wet reading,  repeat radiographs with better inspiration or lateral
 decubitus view could help to better characterize this finding.
 
 2.  Otherwise, no evidence of free air. Bowel distention has improved.
 
 3.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and small amount of pleural fluid and/or
 thickening.
