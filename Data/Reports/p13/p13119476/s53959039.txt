                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p PPM upgrade to BIV (LV lead add to RV lead).
 Subclavian access. Eval for lead position and post procedure complications. 
 // ___ year old man s/p PPM upgrade to BIV (LV lead add to RV lead). Subclavian
 access. Eval for lead position and post procedure complications.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 20:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 On the lateral view, lead tips project anteriorly and posteriorly and could
 lie in relation to the right and left ventricles.  Small amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema is noted about the battery pack, compatible with recent
 surgery.
 
 There is hyperinflation consistent with COPD.  Changes along the right
 mediastinum are consistent with known neo esophagus.  Rounded area of
 increased density in the lower middle mediastinum could also be related to the
 esophageal surgery.  Prominence of the pulmonary hila could reflect pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 There is deformity and pleural thickening along the right chest wall
 consistent with prior trauma and/or surgery.  Multiple clips are seen
 posteriorly in the chest.
 
 There is blunting of both costophrenic angles posteriorly consistent with
 pleural fluid and/or thickening.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Leads extend over the right and left ventricles, respectively.  Small
 bilateral effusions.  No pneumothorax detected. Small amount of subcutaneous
 emphysema is noted about the battery pack compatible with recent surgery.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
 
 No overt CHF.  No focal consolidation.
