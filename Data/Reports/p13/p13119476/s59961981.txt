                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF exacerbation and cough  // r/o PNA     
 r/o PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or
 pericardial effusion has increased.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged and
 small left pleural effusion is new and there is probably mild edema in the
 lower lungs.  Heterogeneous opacification in the right mid lung is partially
 obscured by extensive healed rib fractures and associated pleural thickening
 but raises concern for pneumonia.
 
 Transvenous biventricular pacer leads continuous from the left pectoral
 generator, unchanged.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs, perhaps including oblique
 views, to distinguish between asymmetric edema and pneumonia.
