                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities have substantially decreased in severity.  Their extent,
 however, is still diffuse.  The lung volumes have also increased, so that the
 apparent severity decrease of the parenchymal changes could also be the effect
 of increased ventilatory pressure.
 
 No pleural effusions on today's examination.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
