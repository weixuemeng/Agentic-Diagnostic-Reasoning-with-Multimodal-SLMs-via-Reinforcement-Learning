                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with mechanical ventilation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an ET tube tip
 located 2.9 cm from the level of the carina.  A right IJ central venous
 catheter tip remains approximately 3 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction and
 should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm. An enteric tube is in position.
 
 The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Multifocal bilateral
 parenchymal opacity little changed with probable superimposed pulmonary edema
 and small bilateral pleural effusions is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal pneumonia with superimposed edema, unchanged.
 2.  Right IJ catheter tip 3 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction.  Recommend
 withdrawal for more optimal positioning.
