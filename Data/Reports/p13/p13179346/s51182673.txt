                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, wheezing, and diffuse mild expiratory wheezes.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and more recent chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Volume loss and opacification of the left lung base appears
 compatible with round atelectasis, scarring, and pleural plaque formation, not
 significantly changed.  Calcified pleural plaques are present more broadly
 along the left hemithorax.  The right lung remains clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours also appear
 unchanged.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent left basilar opacification compatible with chronic
 findings with no definite superimposed process.
