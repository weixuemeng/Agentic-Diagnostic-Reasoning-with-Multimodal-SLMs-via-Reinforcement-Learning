                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is listed as EU critical at the time of study
 interpretation.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.6 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube is within the stomach as is the side port.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pulmonary edema demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube.
 
 2. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis.
