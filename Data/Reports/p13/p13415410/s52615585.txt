                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  Please note the following correction.  There is no dextrocardia. 
 Instead, the mediastinum including the heart is shifted toward the right in
 association with volume loss, but situs appears within normal limits.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The AP view is lordotic and rotated.  The lateral view is limited,
 particularly anteriorly, given that the arms are down.  There is similar
 dextrocardia which may relate to volume loss in the right hemithorax.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The lungs appear clear
 within the limitations of technique.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The patient is status post left shoulder replacement surgery. 
 The bones appear demineralized.
