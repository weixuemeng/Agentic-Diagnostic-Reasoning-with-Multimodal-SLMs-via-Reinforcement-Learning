                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough x 1 week and PMHX of COPD and acute onset
 fever/myalgias/arthralgias  // ? infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The pulmonary hila, particularly on the left, are
 prominent, with a tapered appearance, similar to ___.
 
 No evidence of CHF.
 
 Similar the prior study, there is evidence of volume loss on the right, with
 slight rightward shift of mediastinum and slight elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Probable old rib deformities in the right upper zone, question
 posttraumatic or postsurgical.  Developmental changes of the ribs are
 considered less likely.
 
 On the right, there is blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle,
 possible slight pleural thickening and linear atelectasis or scarring in the
 mid zone, unchanged compared with ___.  There is equivocal
 increased in hazy opacity at the right base laterally, which may also relate
 to technical factors and/or pleural thickening.  No discrete focal infiltrate
 and no consolidation is identified in the right lung.  No posterior pleural
 effusions are seen.
 
 On the left, no focal infiltrate or effusion.  Possible minimal atelectasis at
 the left base medially.
 
 At the edge of these images, a left hip shoulder arthroplasty is partially
 imaged, with evidence for a mid left humeral fracture which is probably
 healed.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and right hemithorax volume loss are unchanged
 compared with ___ and ___ as is blunting of the right
 lateral costophrenic angle, subtle changes along the right chest wall, and
 right mid zone linear atelectasis or scarring.
 
 Equivocal slight interval increase in opacity at the right lung base, question
 due to interval increase in pleural thickening versus technical differences. 
 No discrete focal infiltrate.  No consolidation.  No other pleural fluid or
 thickening.
 
 Possible minimal atelectasis at left base medially.
 
 Deformity of ribs at the right lung apex, again noted, unchanged over multiple
 prior imaging studies.
