                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with known R basal ganglia bleed on coumadin  // ?
 Extension of ICH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle bibasilar opacities are most
 likely due to atelectasis, underlying aspiration is not excluded. The aorta is
 tortuous and likely exaggerated by AP, portable technique and low lung
 volumes. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
