 INDICATION:  Patient with fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes without
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged, with prominent azygous vein suggestive of fluid
 overload. The heart is mildly enlarged. Thoracic aorta appears tortuous. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No focal consolidation.
