 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Right femoral hernia, pre-op evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Multiple dilated loops of bowel are
 seen in the abdomen in this patient known to have a small bowel obstruction. 
 There is volume loss in the left lower lung with dense retrocardiac
 opacification and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  It is unclear if
 there is an underlying infectious infiltrate.  The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  The heart continues to be moderately enlarged.  Compared to the prior
 study, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes have not changed.
