                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and chills on chemotherapy and with large right-sided breast
 mass.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Right breast mass, rather
 than lower lobe pneumonia, is probably responsible for added radiodensity to
 the right chest laterally, since no corresponding pulmonary abnormality is
 seen on the lateral view. 
 
 Apparent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours is due at
 least in part to positioning. A 22mm wide oval opacity projecting over the
 right tracheobronchial angle is probably a dilated azygos vein. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are well expanded without focal
 consolidation.  Gaseous distension of colonic loops in the left upper quadrant
 and mid abdomen are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Lungs probably clear.
