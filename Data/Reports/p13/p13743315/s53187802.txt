                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of CHF, now with
 worsening shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia versus fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral view.  Analysis is performed in
 direct comparison with the next preceding similar chest examination of
 ___.  In comparison, the previously existing bilateral pulmonary
 congestive pattern, marked perivascular haze and beginning central edema have
 markedly improved.  No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates can be identified
 and the lateral pleural sinuses are now almost completely free.  A small
 amount of pleural effusion still blunts the lateral pleural sinus and
 comparison of the lateral views demonstrates marked regression of the pleural
 effusions that had accumulated in the posterior pleural sinuses.  Also, the
 fluid accumulation in the major interlobar fissures has cleared up.  Moderate
 cardiac enlargement including prominence of left atrial contour still remains
 and the pulmonary congestive pattern has not yet completely normalized. 
 Presence of large-sized breast prostheses make it more difficult to assess
 pulmonary congestive pattern.  Clearly improvement since the next previous
 examination has been documented.  No evidence of new discrete pulmonary
 pneumonic infiltrates.
