                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congested cough for several days, weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable, and the pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of the pulmonary
 vascular markings towards the apices, compatible with emphysema.  No No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Streaky linear
 opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Scarring within the lung apices is re-
 demonstrated.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia. Emphysema.
