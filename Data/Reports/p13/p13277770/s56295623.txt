                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ICD device, history of pocket
 hematoma, check ICD lead placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly as
 before.  Position of permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position
 connected to total of three electrodes terminating in right atrium, right
 ventricle and venous coronary sinus system in unchanged position.  The
 pulmonary vasculature remains unchanged and shows moderate degree of
 perivascular haze, consistent with chronic congestion.  Obliteration of
 left-sided diaphragmatic contour is suggestive of atelectasis in left lower
 lobe.  The right-sided lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid
 accumulation and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area.  No evidence of
 new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of previously described permanent pacer system
 including the ICD device and biventricular electrodes.  PA and lateral chest
 views for evaluation of elecrtrode positions as of ___ has apparently
 not changed as can be identified on this single view examination.
