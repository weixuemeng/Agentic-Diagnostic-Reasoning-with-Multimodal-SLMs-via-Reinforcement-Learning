                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with non-ischemic
 cardiomyopathy and low ejection fraction with hypoxemia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The current study demonstrates interval progression of interstitial opacities
 in the perihilar area and with more focal abnormalities in the right mid lung
 as well as left lower lobe.  Small amount of pleural effusion has developed in
 the interim as well as left retrocardiac opacities.
 
 Overall, the impression might reflect interstitial pulmonary edema
 progression, but underlying infection is a possibility and should be
 re-assessed after diuresis.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as there is no appreciable change in
 the position of the biventricular pacing.  Extensive calcifications of the
 aorta are re-demonstrated.
