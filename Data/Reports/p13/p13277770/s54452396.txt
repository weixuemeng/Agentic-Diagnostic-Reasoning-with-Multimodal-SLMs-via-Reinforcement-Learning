                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea and history of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The left
 pectoral pacemaker leads end in the right atrium, right ventricle, and
 coronary sinus, unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is less distinct than on the prior study with increased
 interstitial markings, likely representing mild pulmonary edema.  Increased
 opacity at the right lung base may represent asymmetric edema or developing
 infection. There may be a tiny right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild congestive heart failure. 
 Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment to exclude underlying infection,
 particularly at the right lung base.
