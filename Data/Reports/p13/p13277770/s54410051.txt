                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus, appears unchanged.  The
 pacer device projects over the left lateral chest, as before.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged, not significantly changed.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is new widespread mild-to-moderate
 interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary edema.  Hyperinflation is
 suspected based on flattening of the hemidiaphragms.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
