                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been
 removed.  Continued low lung volumes.  There is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, though the pulmonary vascular congestion has essentially
 cleared.  Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, more prominent on the left,
 with underlying compressive atelectasis.
 
 Along the left lateral chest wall, there is an elliptical area of
 opacification that could represent a loculated effusion.
