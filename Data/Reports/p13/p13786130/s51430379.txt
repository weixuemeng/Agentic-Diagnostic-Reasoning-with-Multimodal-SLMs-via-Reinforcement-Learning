 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly persists. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion with left
 basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis is demonstrated, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No right-sided
 pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous
 abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis. Infection cannot be completely excluded.
