                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and acute change in mental status. 
 Evaluate for evidence of cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, latest one on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low with basilar bronchovascular crowding.
 Compared with ___, there has been interval development of bibasilar
 ill-defined opacities.  On the lateral view, a spine sign is noted, and there
 appears to be a tiny right-sided pleural effusion.  The left pleural sulcus is
 clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Severe degenerative
 changes of the right shoulder are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar opacities suggest pneumonia versus aspiration.
 2.  Severe joint disease about the right shoulder.
