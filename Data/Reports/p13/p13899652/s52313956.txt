                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, requiring oxygen.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal atelectasis is seen
 in the lung bases. There is scarring within the lung apices.   Remainder of
 the lungs are otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus posteriorly may be due to the pleural
 thickening or trace pleural effusion.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures
 are noted.  Anterior cervical fusion hardware is partially assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 sulcus posteriorly may be due to pleural thickening or trace pleural effusion.
