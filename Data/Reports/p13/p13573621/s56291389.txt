                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison with ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 The lung volumes are very low, which might explain at least in part bibasilar
 areas of atelectasis, but repeated radiograph with full inspiration is
 recommended to exclude the possibility of basal consolidation due to infection
 or aspiration.
