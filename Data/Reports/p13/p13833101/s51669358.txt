                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with wound infection right above knee
 amputation stump, history of pulmonary embolism, hypotensive
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates within the upper
 SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is borderline enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities
 with the lung bases are more pronounced on the left, potentially atelectasis. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis, though infection is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical
 setting.
