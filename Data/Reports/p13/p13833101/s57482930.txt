                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ morbid obesity, NIDDM, and severe PVD w/ RLE critical limb
 ischemia s/p arteriogram and thrombectomy with post-op respiratory failure now
 s/p AKA with occasional desats on the vent  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recent prior from ___. 
 Aorta CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval improvement in lung volumes, which still remain slightly
 low.  This results in improvement of the widening of the cardiac silhouette,
 which is still mildly enlarged.  Left lower lobe consolidation persists, and
 may represent a combination of effusion and atelectasis, with underlying
 infection is not excluded.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right perihilar consolidation most likely represents atypical
 edema given waxing and waning nature over time, but pneumonia remains a
 possibility. Left internal jugular line terminates at the junction with the
 SVC.  NG and ET tubes are in standard positions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right perihilar consolidation, most likely atypical edema, alternatively
 pneumonia.
