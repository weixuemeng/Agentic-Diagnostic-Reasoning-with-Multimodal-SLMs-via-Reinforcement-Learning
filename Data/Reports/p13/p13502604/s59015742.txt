                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell
 carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded with fibrotic changes in the lung bases
 bilaterally which are consistent with findings from previous CT.  Though there
 is blunting within the left costophrenic angle, it most likely represents
 pleural thickening and scarring with some adjacent atelectasis; no pleural
 effusion is identified.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with
 sternotomy wires seen well positioned and aligned along the midline with no
 evidence of hardware failure.  The heart is top normal in size.  Aorta is
 normal in appearance.  The hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.  Pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable, and there is no pneumothorax. Osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fibrotic changes seen in the lung bases, consistent with findings
 from previous CT.  No evidence of infection or malignancy.
