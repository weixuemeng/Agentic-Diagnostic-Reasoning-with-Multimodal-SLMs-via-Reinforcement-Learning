                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Persistent large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis
 in the right middle and right lower lobe.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by diffuse interstitial edema, similar to the recent radiograph. 
 There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.  Nonspecific pleural and
 parenchymal scarring at right apex are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities most likely due to interstitial edema, but followup
 radiographs would be helpful after diuresis to ensure resolution and to
 exclude other causes of diffuse lung disease.
