                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure with dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is unchanged, and
 within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures which is chronic.  Volume loss in
 the right lung is unchanged, with increased interstitial opacities in lung
 bases, slightly progressed from the prior study. The pulmonary vascularity is
 not engorged. Small right pleural effusion is likely present. No new definite
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial opacities in the lung bases, slightly
 worse when compared to the prior study, which may represent superimposed
 bibasilar atelectasis on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease. 
 No pulmonary edema is noted.
