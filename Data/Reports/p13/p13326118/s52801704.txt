                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pericardial effusion and per history removed
 left lung  // pericardial effusion? absent lung?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is almost complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward
 shift of the trachea and aortic knob is compatible with volume loss. 
 Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to opacification of the
 left hemithorax.  The right lung is clear.  There is a calcified aortic knob. 
 Feeding tube projects over the right mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Opacification left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift is
 compatible with volume loss in this patient with reported history of
 pneumonectomy.
 
 2.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette and presence of a pericardial
 effusion is limited due to opacification of left hemithorax.
