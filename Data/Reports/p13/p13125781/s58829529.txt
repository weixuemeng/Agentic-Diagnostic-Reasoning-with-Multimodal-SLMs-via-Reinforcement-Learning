                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // Eval for pleural effusion, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Right IJ access Port-A-Cath is again
 seen with its tip in the region of the right atrium.  Overlying EKG leads are
 present.  The lung volumes are somewhat low.  Vague opacity in the lower lungs
 could reflect crowding of bronchovascular markings and atelectasis given low
 lung volumes though small partially layering pleural effusions difficult to
 exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No large pneumothorax.  No
 convincing evidence for pneumonia.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  Low lung volumes with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings within the lower lungs.
