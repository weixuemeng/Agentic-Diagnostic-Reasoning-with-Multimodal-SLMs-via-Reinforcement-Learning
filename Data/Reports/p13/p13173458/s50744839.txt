                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ON ___ 11:03 A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with Crohn's disease.  Check NG tube placement for
 SBO.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ views of the abdomen:
 
 Newly placed nasogastric tube ends in the mild to moderately distended
 stomach.  It is possible that distention of upper small bowel loops has
 improved.  Lung volumes are quite low and there is at least a moderate degree
 of atelectasis in both lung bases.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not significant.  Heart size is top normal.  The upper
 mediastinum is widened, but in a fashion that could be due to fat deposition,
 perhaps due to steroid administration.
