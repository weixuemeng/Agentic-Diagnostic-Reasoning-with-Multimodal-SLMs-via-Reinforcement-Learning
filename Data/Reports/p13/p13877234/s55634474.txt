                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 clearly seen.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the lower thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
