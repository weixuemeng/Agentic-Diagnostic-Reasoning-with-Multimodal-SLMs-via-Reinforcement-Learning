                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with suicide attempt and altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes and appears
 top normal in size.  Mediastinal contour appears slightly widened superiorly,
 likely due to low lung volumes and supine AP technique.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures likely due to low lung volumes without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted on this
 supine exam.  No displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
