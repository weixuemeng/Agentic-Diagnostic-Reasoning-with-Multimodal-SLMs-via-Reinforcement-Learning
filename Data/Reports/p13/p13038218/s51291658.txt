                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Complaints of productive cough with body aches.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a persistent
 though less conspicuous left lower lobe opacification most consistent with
 resolving pneumonia.  No other areas of opacification identified.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent though less conspicuous left lower lobe opacification
 consistent with resolving pneumonia.  Continue with stated course of followup
 radiographs after treatment to ensure resolution.
