                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema,
 atelectasis, or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Proir radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semiupright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is a small left-sided pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis which is unchanged from the prior study. 
 Again seen is some engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A
 right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, not
 significantly changed.
 
 2.  Engorgement of pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.
