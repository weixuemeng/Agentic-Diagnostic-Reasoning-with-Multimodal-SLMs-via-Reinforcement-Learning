                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a dual-lead pacer with tips projecting over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The lungs and pleural spaces are essentially clear without
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  There is mild retrocardiac opacity that
 likely reflects atelectasis, although infection is not definitively excluded. 
 The heart is normal in size.  The thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous.  There
 is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum and there is mild degenerative change
 within the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity reflects atelectasis, although infection is
 not entirely excluded.
