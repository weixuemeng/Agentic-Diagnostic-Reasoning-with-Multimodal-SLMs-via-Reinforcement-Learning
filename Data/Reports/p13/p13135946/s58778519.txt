                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, evaluate Dobbhoff tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the GE junction and upper
 stomach.  Residual contrast again noted. An additional NG tube type tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm,  off film.  ET tube in satisfactory
 position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.   Right subclavian central
 line tip over distal SVC.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears smaller.  Sternotomy wires and prosthetic
 valve noted.  There is CHF with interstitial edema.  Allowing for technical
 differences, this is fairly similar to the most recent prior film.  There is a
 small-to-moderate left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Hazy density at the right base also likely reflects layering
 effusion, with some underlying atelectasis.
