                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary failure, assess Dobbhoff.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Rotated positioning. 
 
 A Dobbhoff tube is present -- the radiopaque tip overlies the upper stomach. 
 Focal density in the left upper quadrant appears to represent contrast in
 relation to the stomach near the GE junction  An additional nasogastric type
 tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off film.  An ET tube is
 present -- the tip is obscured but appears to lie approximately 3.5 cm above
 the carina.  The right subclavian central line tip overlies the distal SVC. 
 Sternotomy wires, mediastinal and ? upper abdominal clips are present.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
 with CHF.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There are small-to-moderate bilateral
 effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff tube tip overlying stomach.  Residual contrast appears unchanged
 compared with ___ at 2:29 a.m. The absence of interval change is atypical
 and raises question of local pooling of contrast.  Clinical correlation
 requested.
 
 2.  Bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation,
 unchanged.
 
 3.  CHF findings, also grossly unchanged.
