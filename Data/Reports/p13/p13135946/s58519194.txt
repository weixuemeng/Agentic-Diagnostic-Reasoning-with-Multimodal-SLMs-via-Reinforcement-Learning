                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. 
 Right subclavian central line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve and multiple clips in the
 mediastinum, near the thoracic inlet, and in the upper abdomen.  Unusual
 density overlying the gastric fundus may represent some residual oral contrast
 within the stomach.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  
 
 There are bilateral effusions, with some underlying atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring likely reflects
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1)  Interval placement of the ET tube, tip in satisfactory position above the
 carina.  Otherwise, overall similar.
 2)  Radiopacity over stomach - ? residual contrast. Clinical correlation
 requested.
 3) LLL collpase consolidation. 
 4) Bilateral effusions.
 5) Probable CHF.
