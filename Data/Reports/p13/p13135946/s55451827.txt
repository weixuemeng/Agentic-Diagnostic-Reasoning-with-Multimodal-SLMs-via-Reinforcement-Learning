                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post MV repair and CABG, assess for pleural
 effusions.  Patient with acidosis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard
 position.  Right subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged, larger
 on the right side.  This could be atelectasis but superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural effusions previously seen are
 less conspicuous in this examination.  There are no new lung abnormalities. 
 There is mild vascular congestion.  NG tube tip is out of view below the
 diaphragm.
