                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with epigastric pain, n/v  // Rule out free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. 
 The lungs are grossly clear aside from a nodular opacity in the left midlung. 
 This may represent a vessel, though nodular opacity is not excluded.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No subdiaphragmatic air is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Possible left mid lung nodule.  Consider obliques views versus nonemergent
 chest CT to further assess.
 2.  Otherwise no acute abnormality.
