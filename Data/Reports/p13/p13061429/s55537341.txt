                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and without
 change.  Lungs are overexpanded but grossly clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with no acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality identified.
 
 2.  Overinflation of the lungs, probably related to COPD in the setting of
 known emphysema on prior chest CT.
