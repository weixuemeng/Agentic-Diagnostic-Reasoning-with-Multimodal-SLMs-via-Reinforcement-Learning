                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough, history of
 multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine. 
 Please note that chest radiography is not the optimal study to evaluate the
 bones for multiple myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
