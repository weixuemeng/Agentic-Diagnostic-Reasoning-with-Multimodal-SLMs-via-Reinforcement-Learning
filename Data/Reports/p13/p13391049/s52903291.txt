                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx AML s/p ___ chemotherapy p/w cough
 while neutropenic  // pneumonia, evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volume is low.  There is an ill-defined hazy opacity with uniform
 density obscuring the left heart border concerning for infarction versus
 infection in the left upper lobe.  However, the appearance is not typical of
 pneumonia.  Atelectasis in the left lung is also appreciated.  The pulmonary
 venous congestion is unchanged from prior.There is also bilateral diffuse
 interstitial opacities, not fully explained by pulmonary venous congestion. 
 There is minimal pleural effusion bilaterally.  No pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No fractures.  The right Port-A-Cath
 terminates at cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The left upper lobe ill-defined opacity is concerning for infarction
 versus infection but the appearance is atypical of infection.
 
 2.  Diffuse interstitial opacities of unclear etiology.
 
 3.  Unchanged pulmonary venous congestion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest with contrast to further characterize the nature
 of the left upper lobe hazy opacity and of the diffuse interstitial opacity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 Pei-___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:11 PM, 10 minutes after
