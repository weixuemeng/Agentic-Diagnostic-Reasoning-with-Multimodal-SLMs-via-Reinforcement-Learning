                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post fall.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 detected.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  1.7 cm
 ill-defined density projecting over the right upper lung field may represent
 right 1st rib costochondral calcification, but small focus of infection,
 contusion or nodule cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.7 cm opacity projecting over the right upper lung field, which could
 represent costochondral calcification, focus of infection, contusion or lung
 nodule.  Apical lordotic view may be helpful.  Alternatively, non-urgent chest
 CT could be performed.  
 
 Findings were discussed with ___ by ___ by telephone at
 14:20 on ___ at the time of discovery of these findings.
