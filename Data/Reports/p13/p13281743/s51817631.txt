                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, hypercapnia  // r/o pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. There is a
 minimal increase in lung volumes, likely reflecting improved ventilation.
 However, mild fluid overload as well as bilateral areas of atelectasis at the
 lung bases continue to be seen.  No larger pleural effusions. Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists. Unchanged position of the right PICC line and the right
 hemodialysis catheter.
