  Right IJ dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. Right PICC at the
  cavoatrial junction. Re- demonstration of low lung volumes with bibasilar
  atelectasis and unchanged moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion.
  Underlying mild to moderate pulmonary edema and vascular congestion is
  unchanged. Though there is no obvious change to suggest pneumonia, infection
  cannot be excluded given the appropriate circumstance.
