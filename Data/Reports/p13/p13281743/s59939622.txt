                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of increased BNP.  Rule out pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild enlargement of the heart.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  No acute focal consolidation concerning for infection is
 identified. There no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is apparent
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm versus right subpulmonic effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is identified. The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm versus right subpulmonic
 effusion.  No priors are available for determination of the stability of the
 finding.  Recommend lateral decubitus films for further evaluation.  
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
