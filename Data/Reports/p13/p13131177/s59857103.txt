                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings at
 the lung bases.  4-mm rounded calcified nodule projecting over the right upper
 lung most likely represents a calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Mild degenerative changes are seen
 along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
