                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new poorly defined 2.8 cm x 1.7 cm diameter opacity has developed
 in the left mid lung region at the level of the seventh posterior rib level
 with the intersection of the left fourth anterior rib.  On the lateral view,
 this has a spherical configuration and is localized to the anterior segment of
 the left upper lobe.  Lungs are otherwise clear except for unchanged biapical
 and basilar linear scarring.  Heart is normal in size.  Aorta is tortuous. 
 Bones are remarkable for healed left anterior rib fractures and degenerative
 changes of the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  2.8 cm left upper lobe nodule, highly concerning for a primary
 lung cancer.  Further evaluation with chest CT is recommended for initial
 further evaluation as entered into the radiology communications dashboard on
 ___.
