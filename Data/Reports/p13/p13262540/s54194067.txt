 HISTORY:  CABG with chest pain, to assess for failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has undergone
 interval CABG procedure with intact midline sternal wires.  There is some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, but no
 evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle persists.
