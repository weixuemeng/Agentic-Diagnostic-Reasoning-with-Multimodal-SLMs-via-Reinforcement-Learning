                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with 2 days fever  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of bronchovascular structures.
 Multifocal, linear left basilar atelectasis is again noted. Airspace opacities
 at the right lung base are slightly increased from the prior examination, and
 may represent atelectasis although infection is not excluded. There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with increased bibasilar airspace opacities. Findings likely
 represent atelectasis, although underlying infection is difficult to exclude.
