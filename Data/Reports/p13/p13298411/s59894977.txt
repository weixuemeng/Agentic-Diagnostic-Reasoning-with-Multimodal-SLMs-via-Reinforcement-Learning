                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  intubation, head bleed.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Enteric tube is seen terminating in the mid hemithorax to the left
 of midline and may be within the mid-to-distal esophagus with side port above
 the level of the carina.  Recommend repositioning so that it terminates within
 the stomach.  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 9.5 cm
 above the level of the carina, somewhat high in position.  Dual-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending in expected positions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is rotated somewhat to the
 left.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  There are left greater than right subtle perihilar opacities which
 may be due to mild edema, although infectious process or aspiration is not
 excluded, particularly on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube high in position, as above.  Nasogastric tube also high
 in position; repositioning recommended.  These findings were discussed with
 Dr. ___ at 12:20 a.m. on ___ via telephone.
 
 2.  Left greater than right infrahilar opacities may be due to aspiration,
 although mild underlying pulmonary edema or infection not excluded.
