                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis is not excluded.  The left lung is clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle with subtle
 linear opacity at the right costophrenic angle, could be due to a very trace
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
