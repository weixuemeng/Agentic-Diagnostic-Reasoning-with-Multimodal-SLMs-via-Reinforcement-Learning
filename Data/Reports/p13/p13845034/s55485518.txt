 INDICATION:  Recurrent right-sided pleural effusion status post Pleurx
 catheter placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right Pleurx catheter with
 the tip at the right lung base with interval decrease in right pleural
 effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax.  Associated right lung base opacity
 is unchanged.  There has been interval increase of asymmetric left perihilar
 and basal opacities suggestive of asymmetric edema.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Placement of right Pleurx catheter with interval decrease in
 right effusion without evidence of pneumothorax.  Increased left perihilar and
 basal opacity suggestive of asymmetric edema.
