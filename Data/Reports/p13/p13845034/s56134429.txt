                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Bloody sputum status post thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  New opacities in the right lower lobe are likely
 due to reexpansion pulmonary edema.  Small right effusion is unchanged.  There
 are no other acute interval changes.
