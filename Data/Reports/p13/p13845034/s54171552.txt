                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuous aorta is unchanged.  Hilar
 contours are stable.  A right Pleurx catheter remains in place at the
 cardiophrenic sulcus with small amount of remnant right effusion with a small
 loculated fissural component.  However, there is a new finding of increased
 lucency at the right lung base concerning for basal pneumothorax.  Right basal
 atelectasis has otherwise improved with increased aeration of both lungs. 
 Previous mild interstitial edema has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval improvement of right diffusion with small amount of remnant fluid
 with improved aeration at bilateral lung bases.
 2.  Increased lucency at the right lung base is worrisome for a right basal
 pneumothorax.
