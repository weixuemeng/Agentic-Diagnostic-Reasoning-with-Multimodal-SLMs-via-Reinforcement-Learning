                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with right pleural effusion.  Assess interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has reaccumulated since ___.  Aside from
 attendant right basal atelectasis, lungs are clear.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular anatomy
 unremarkable.  Triangular right juxtahilar opacity is a fissural pleural
 effusion and should not be mistaken for a new lung nodule.
 
 9-mm long tubular opacity projecting just superior to the medial right
 clavicle is new, but I am not sure whether it is internal or external
 artifact.  If internal, it could be a small fragment of catheter.  This area
 should be reevaluated with conventional radiography performed with the patient
 disrobed to the waist to remove anything external.
