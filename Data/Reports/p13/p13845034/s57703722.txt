                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF, now with dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___ and CT torso from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The previously seen pulmonary edema
 has resolved since prior exam.  Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases,
 which likely represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. 
 Scarring is seen in the left lung apex.  There is a partially loculated small
 right pleural effusion, which is slightly improved in interval.  There is a
 trace left pleural effusion, unchanged from prior exam.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, unchanged from prior exam.  The aorta is noted to be
 tortuous.  There is a right-sided basilar chest tube in unchanged position
 from prior exam. Median sternotomy wires and CABG clips are noted in the
 chest. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, which likely represent atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded.
