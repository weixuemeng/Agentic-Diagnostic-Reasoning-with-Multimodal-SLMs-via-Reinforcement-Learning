 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion, has been a recurrent
 problem, slightly larger today than on ___.  Opacification in the right
 lower lobe has been heterogeneous on several previous studies and is
 concerning for chronic pneumonia, usually due to aspiration.  Focal
