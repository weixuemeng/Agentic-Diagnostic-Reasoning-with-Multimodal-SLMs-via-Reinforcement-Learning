 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen
 without definite focal consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  Low lung volumes,
 which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
