                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  prostate ca s/p robotic prostatectomy now s/p repeat laparatomy
 for bleeding, still intubated and on neosynephrine for hypotension  // ?acute
 change, ET placement     ; prostate ca s/p robotic prostatectomy now s/p
 repeat laparatomy for bleeding, still intubated now with OG tube replacement 
 // OGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A newly placed endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. A
 new OG tube coils in the larynx but enters a large hiatal hernia. A right IJ
 central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Left basilar airspace opacities are most likely due to atelectasis adjacent to
 the hiatal hernia.
 
 The followup radiograph performed shortly thereafter shows further advancement
 of the OG tube into the intrathoracic stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 OG tube terminates in the intrathoracic stomach.
 ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.
 Left basilar airspace opacities are most likely atelectasis around the large
 hiatal hernia.
