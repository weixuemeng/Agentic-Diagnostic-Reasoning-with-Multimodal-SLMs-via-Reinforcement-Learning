                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p stabbing with hemothorax, s/p CT removal  //
 please assess for interval change. please do CXR at 5:00pm
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 827
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax
 is detected. Lucency seen in raise supraclavicular region more likely
 represents anatomic fat than subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Patchy increased retrocardiac
 density is similar to the prior film. Minimal atelectasis is again noted at
 the right base. Equivocal minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles,
 without gross effusion. Surgical clips noted over the mid abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax detected status post removal of right chest tube.
 2. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Again seen is patchy
 retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, minimal patchy opacity at the right base, and possible tiny
 bilateral pleural effusions.
