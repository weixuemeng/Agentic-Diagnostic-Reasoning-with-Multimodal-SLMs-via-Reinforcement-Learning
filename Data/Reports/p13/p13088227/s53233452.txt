                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Attempted left-sided pacemaker via subclavian vein.  Now has
 pacemaker via right cephalic vein.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___, ___:59 p.m.:
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Chest cage anatomy is
 distorted by scoliosis and rib deformities.  Right trans-subclavian right
 atrioventricular pacer leads are probably in standard position, but of course
 these have been confirmed by ultrasound localization.
 
 Right lung is grossly clear.  Left lung is difficult to assess because of the
 overlying chest cage.
