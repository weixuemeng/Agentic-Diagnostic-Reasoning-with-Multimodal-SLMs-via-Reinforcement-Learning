                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, nausea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Relative blunting of the left costophrenic angle is most likely due to
 overlying soft tissue.  There is slight prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature, which may be due to mild pulmonary vascular congestion in
 conjunction with relatively low lung volumes.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is
 no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion without definite
 focal consolidation.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views when/if patient
 able for further evaluation.
