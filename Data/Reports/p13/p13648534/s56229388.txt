                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with new placement of trach.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___ at 05:14.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. 
 
 Endotracheal tube has been removed and a tracheostomy placed.  Right atrial,
 right ventricular, and left ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in
 stable position.  Right PICC tip is not well visualized.  PEG is present below
 the diaphragm.  Consolidation at both lung bases has increased, compatible
 with worsening pneumonia.  Indistinct appearance of the costophrenic angles is
 compatible with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased bibasilar opacities, compatible with worsening pneumonia with
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  
 2.  New tracheostomy tube appears in appropriate position.
