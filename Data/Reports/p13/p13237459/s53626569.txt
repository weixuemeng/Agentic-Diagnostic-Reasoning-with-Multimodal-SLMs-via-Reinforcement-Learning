                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with FTT hypoxic  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ from an outside facility and
 uploaded onto PACS.  CT torso dated ___ from an outside facility and also
 up loaded onto PACS.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is slightly rotated.  The lungs are hyperinflated with severe
 emphysema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Parenchymal opacities
 corresponding to significant volume loss in the right lung, predominantly in
 the right upper lobe as appreciated on prior CT with right shift of the
 mediastinum and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with tenting, overall
 unchanged.  Concurrent infection cannot be excluded.  Lucencies projecting
 over the right apex is consistent with apical bulla are best appreciated on
 prior CT.  There is also emphysema in the left apex.  No pneumothorax.  Right
 lung parenchymal opacities have progressed concerning for new infection.  Left
 lower lung opacities are subtle but appears slightly worse from ___, also
 concerning for infection.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Since the radiograph on ___, there is increased right lung and left
 lower lung parenchymal opacity concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 3.  Persistent right upper lobe atelectasis/ consolidation apical bulla. 
 Concurrent superinfection is possible.
