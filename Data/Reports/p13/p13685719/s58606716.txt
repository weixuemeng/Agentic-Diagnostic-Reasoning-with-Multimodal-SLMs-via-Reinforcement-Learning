                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right sided chest pain and fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Low lung volumes are
 present which accentuates mediastinal widening and the size of the heart. The
 cardiac silhouette size is at least mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary
 edema. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but
 infection cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes which accentuate mediastinal widening and cardiac size. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded.
