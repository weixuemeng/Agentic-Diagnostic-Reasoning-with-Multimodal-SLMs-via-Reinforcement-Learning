                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with metastatic breast cancer, now with
 shortness of breath and increasing oxygen requirement, question pneumonia,
 question effusion, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 11:50 a.m. as
 well as selected images from a chest CT performed on ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There has been interval decrease in lung volumes.  There is a small right
 layering pleural effusion which in retrospect was present on the CT study of
 ___.  Vague patchy opacity is seen in the right costophrenic angle,
 which may represent an infectious or inflammatory process given the interval
 change from the prior study of ___.  In addition, there is soft tissue
 opacity in the right hilar area which likely corresponds to the
 lymphadenopathy seen on the CT study dated ___.  No focal area of
 consolidation is seen.  However, these findings could reflect an atypical
 infectious process superimposed on known metastatic disease from breast
 cancer.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the AP window and left suprahilar
 region in this patient status post surgery.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
