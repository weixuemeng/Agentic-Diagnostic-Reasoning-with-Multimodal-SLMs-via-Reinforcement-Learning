                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RA, right shoulder pain, ?rt. apical
 abnormality  // ?abnormality in Rt. apex - per report of shoulder xray ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Shoulder radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA, lateral, and apical views of the chest provided.
 
 The previously seen increased opacity on shoulder radiograph is likely
 reflecting a small apical consolidation, which was also previously
 characterized on chest CT from ___. This opacity is barely seen in
 this current chest radiograph. Otherwise, lungs are clear. Heart size is
 normal. There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously described right apical opacity, which was most likely reflecting a
 small apical consolidation, is barely seen in this current study.
