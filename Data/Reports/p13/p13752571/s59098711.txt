                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall to ground, concern for head, neck, chest and pelvic
 injuries.  Evaluate for traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are normally expanded.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  1.6 cm relatively rounded opacity is seen at the medial left lung
 base, may be artifactual, but underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded.  The
 heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Within the limitations of chest
 radiography, no displaced rib fracture is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No evidence of acute intrathoracic injury.
 
 1.6 cm relatively rounded opacity is seen at the medial left lung base, may be
 artifactual, but underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded.  Recommend oblique
 views or CT for further evaluation.
