 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:53 AM
  1.  Tiny right pneumothorax and mild right pneumomediastinum. 2. Bilateral
  lower lobe opacities most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical correlation
  is recommended to assess for superimposed infection.  3. Mild pulmonary edema
  with small bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with ett/ogt placement; found down, + SA, OD.  Assess
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph ___ at 21:33 and 21:29.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 4 cm above the level the
 carina.  An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip in stomach
 and side ports below level of the diaphragm.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and mild pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is present.  Small bilateral, left
 greater than right, pleural effusions.  A tiny right pneumothorax as well as
 mild right pneumomediastinum is present.  Mild mediastinal widening is likely
 related to patient positioning and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Tiny right pneumothorax and mild right pneumomediastinum.
 2.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities most consistent with atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation is recommended to assess for superimposed infection.
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral, left greater than right,
 pleural effusions.
