                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with bilateral VATS procedures, right
 lung biopsy, and left lower lobectomy; evaluate for pneumothorax on right side
 after chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  During the interval, the right-sided chest
 tube has been removed with pneumothorax remaining as it existed while the tube
 was in place.  This can be measured up to 2 cm in the right axillary area but
 narrows to a few millimeters within the apical region.  In comparison with the
 preceding study, there is no critical collapse of the right lung.  No new
 parenchymal processes can be seen.  In the left hemithorax, the previously
 described left-sided chest tube introduced from the lateral anterior chest
 wall and reaching finally the lateral posterior pleural sinus remains
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of increased pleural effusion in comparison
 with the previous study, and no pneumothorax is seen on the left side.  Chest
 wall emphysema on the left side related to the tube and since remains as
 before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small stable pneumothorax in right upper lobe area remaining
 after chest tube removal.  No progression of pulmonary collapse.
