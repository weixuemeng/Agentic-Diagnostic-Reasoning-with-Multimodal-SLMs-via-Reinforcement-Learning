                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with increased oxygen requirement and history of
 COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph, ___ and CT
 chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are stable with improvement in bilateral lower lobe
 opacification previously ascribed to aspiration pneumonia.  There has also
 been interval decrease in pleural effusions; however, a mild increase in
 vascular congestion is observed with stable cardiomegaly. There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is characteristic widening of the ascending aorta
 consistent with severe aortic stenosis better seen on prior CT imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving aspiration pneumonitis with decreasing bilateral pleural
 effusion.
 2.  Increasing vascular congestion with stable cardiomegaly.
 3.  Severe aortic stenosis as demonstrated on ___ CT.
