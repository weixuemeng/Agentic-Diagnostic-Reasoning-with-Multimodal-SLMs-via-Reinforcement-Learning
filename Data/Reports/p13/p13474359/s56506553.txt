                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable views of the chest were obtained.  There is patchy
 lateral right basilar opacity, which may relate to overlying soft tissue. 
 However, underlying pleural effusion or consolidation is not excluded.  Slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue. 
 There may be mild left basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
