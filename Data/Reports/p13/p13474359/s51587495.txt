                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-intubation with low sats.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates no pneumothorax.  The
 endotracheal tube is stable in position approximately 6 cm above the carina.
 As before, the tip of the nasogastric tube can only be seen to the level of
 the distal esophagus and should be advanced.  There is persistent bibasilar
 opacification, with small bilateral pleural effusions, and enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable positioning of ET tube. Nasogastric tube tip is only seen in the
 distal esophagus and should be advanced.
 3.  Continued mild congestive heart failure.
