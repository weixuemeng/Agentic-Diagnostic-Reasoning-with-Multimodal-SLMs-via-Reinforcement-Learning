                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation.  Evaluate ETT tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest x-ray on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube tip located approximately 7 cm above the carina. A
 nasogastric tube is visualized but its distal course is not well seen, with
 tip appearing to terminate in the distal esophagus, above the diaphragm. There
 is continued bibasilar opacification of the lungs compatible with mild
 congestive heart failure and small bilateral pleural effusions. No
 pneumothorax.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval placement of the endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 7 cm
 above the carina. Nasogastric tube tip appears to be in the distal esophagus
 and should be advanced.
