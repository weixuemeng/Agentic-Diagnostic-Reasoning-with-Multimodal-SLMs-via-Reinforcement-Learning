                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF and COPD, now with hypotension and hypoxia. Evaluate
 for pneumothorax. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs performed on the same day
 ___ at 11:43.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared with the prior exam performed 2 hr earlier, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Redemonstrated are bibasilar streaky airspace
 opacities compatible atelectasis versus infection.  There is blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic angles, which may be secondary to small pleural
 effusions versus atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains enlarged, and is unchanged.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Stable bibasilar airspace opacities which may reflect atelectasis versus
 infection. 
 
 3.  Possible mild pulmonary congestion.
