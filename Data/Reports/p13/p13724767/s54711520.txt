                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with aspiration pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.  
 
 There is a single-lead left AICD which is intact and unchanged.  There are two
 central venous catheters in the right, a PICC line and a Port-A-Cath.  Distal
 lead tips are projected over the distal SVC.  Heart size is within normal
 limits.  There are again seen areas of consolidation within the lungs
 bilaterally but more confluent at the bases.  Findings can be seen with
 pulmonary edema, although a superimposed infection is also possible.
