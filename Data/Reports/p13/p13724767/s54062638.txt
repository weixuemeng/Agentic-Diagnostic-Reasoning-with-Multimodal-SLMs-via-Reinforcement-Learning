 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx acute decompensated HF and pulmonary
 edema being diuresed now with increased SOB  // ?pulmonary edema vs. expanding
 pleural effusion vs. PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase of
 pre-existing pleural effusions. The effusions cause an increase in
 radiodensity of the lung bases. The lung volumes have minimally decreased. The
 distension of the upper lobe vessels is slightly progressive, potentially
 indicating an increase in severity of pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly
 persists. Monitoring and support devices are constant.
