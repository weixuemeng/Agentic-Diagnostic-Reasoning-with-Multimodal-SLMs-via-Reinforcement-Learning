                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea, hypoxia, c/f pulm edema  // Any
 interval increase in pulm edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary
 edema have decreased and bilateral pleural effusions of moderate extent have
 appeared.  These can likely be explained by the clearing of the pulmonary
 edema.  Mild signs of pulmonary edema still remain present. Mild cardiomegaly
 with bilateral basal areas of atelectasis.  No new parenchymal opacities
 suggesting pneumonia. The right PICC line and the left pacemaker are in
 constant normal position.
