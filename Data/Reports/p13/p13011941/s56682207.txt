                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, there
 is opacification of the right base posteriorly and laterally consistent with
 pleural thickening seen on previous CT.  Opacity is slightly less prominent on
 the current study as compared to the prior.  There is persistent blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, again possibly due to combination of pleural
 thickening and a small pleural effusion.  No new focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are seen on spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.
