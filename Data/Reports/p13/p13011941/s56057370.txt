                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post right lung surgery, bleeding at
 surgery site
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval decrease in the amount of subcutaneous emphysema in
 the right lateral chest wall. A moderate size right pleural effusion which
 appears partially loculated laterally and along the apex appears minimally
 decreased in size. Clips and chain sutures from prior right middle lobe
 lobectomy are present with evidence of right-sided volume loss with mild
 rightward shift of midline structures. Cardiac and mediastinal structures
 appear otherwise unchanged. No pulmonary edema is present.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis is again noted. Left lung is otherwise clear.  Small left pleural
 effusion is noted, new in the interval. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute
 osseous abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Perhaps minimal decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion with
 associated right lower lobe atelectasis.
 2. Interval decrease in right subcutaneous emphysema.
 3. Small left pleural effusion, new in the interval.
