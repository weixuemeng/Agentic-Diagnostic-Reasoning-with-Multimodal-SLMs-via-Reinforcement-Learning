 basilar chest tubes appear in unchanged positions. Small right apical
 pneumothorax is similar compared to the prior study. Extensive right chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema is re- demonstrated, not substantially changed in
 the interval. Trace left subcutaneous emphysema is also unchanged. The cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are similar with mild rightward shift as seen
 previously due to right-sided volume loss. Patchy opacification within the
 right lung base is again noted, potentially atelectasis. Left lung is clear.
 No definite pleural effusion is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
