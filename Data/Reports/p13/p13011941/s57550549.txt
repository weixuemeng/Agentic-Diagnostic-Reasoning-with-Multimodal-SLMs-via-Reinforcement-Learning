                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  //pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post right middle lobectomy and right upper lobe wedge
 resection with clips noted at the right hilum.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contour appears similar with mild rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures reflective of the right-sided volume loss.  Fullness of the hila
 bilaterally likely reflects underlying lymphadenopathy, as noted on recent
 chest CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 with mild emphysematous changes again noted with an upper lobe predominance.  
 Chronic small right pleural effusion is unchanged with mild adjacent
 atelectasis in the right lung base.  Innumerable nodules within the lungs are
 progressed from ___, but not substantially changed from the
 previous chest CT.  No new focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Innumerable pulmonary metastases, as seen on the previous chest CT, and
 progressed from the previous chest radiograph.
 2. Chronic small right pleural effusion.
 3. Postsurgical changes in the right lung.
 4. Mild upper lobe predominant emphysema.
 5. Fullness of the hila bilaterally compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy.
 6. No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
