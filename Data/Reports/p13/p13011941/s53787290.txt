                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post right thoracotomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed approximately 9 hr prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Comparison is made to radiograph performed 9 hr prior. There is been little
 interval change in overall appearance of the thorax. Two right chest tubes are
 noted. A  right pneumothorax persists, unchanged. Pneumatosis within the right
 chest wall is less conspicuous. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but stable right pneumothorax. Likely small left pleural effusion.
