                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___ ; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus is likely due to pleural thickening as seen on prior CT,
 unchanged, without a right pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
