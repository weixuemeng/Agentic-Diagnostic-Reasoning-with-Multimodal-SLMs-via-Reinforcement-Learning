                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST PICC PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis with
 PICC in place // PICC positioning
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi erect AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CTA Chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC line ends in the mid SVC.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic
 valve replacement appear unchanged. Lung volumes are slightly low, unchanged. 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is more pronounced, compatible with
 atelectasis and volume loss. Compared to the prior exam, increased opacity in
 the left lung base could represent atelectasis, but focal consolidation and
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting is possible and may be present
 on recent CT.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  No pleural effusion, frank
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right PICC line ends in mid SVC.
 2.  Moderate left lung atelectasis.
 3. Increased opacity in the left lung base could represent atelectasis and/or
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 11:37 AM.
