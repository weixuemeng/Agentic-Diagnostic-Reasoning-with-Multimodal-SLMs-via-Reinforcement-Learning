 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is opacification of the right lower lobe
 silhouetting the diaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is severe
 cardiomegaly with unchanged mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are grossly
 unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of superior subluxation of the right
 humeral head, which is unchanged and likely related to chronic rotator cuff
 pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2. Severe cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edemaedema.
