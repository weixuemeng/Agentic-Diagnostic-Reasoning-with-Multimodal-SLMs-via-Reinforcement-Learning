                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
 the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Streak of
 atelectasis is seen at the left base.  There is suggestion of some
 retrocardiac opacification that most likely represents some atelectatic
 change.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
