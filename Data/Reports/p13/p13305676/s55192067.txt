 INDICATION:   Small bowel obstruction, nasogastric tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest

 A nasogastric tube tip is located within the stomach. Heart size is top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine. Excreted contrast material from recent CT exam is noted within
 the collecting systems bilaterally. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel are
 compatible with known small bowel obstruction.
