                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 bibasilar, left greater than right atelectasis.  Lower lung volumes compared
 to prior radiograph could potentially accentuate the right heart border and
 increased prominence of the pulmonary vascularity. Mediastinal contour and
 hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased prominence of right heart border and pulmonary vascularity
 compared to ___ chest radiograph, possibly due to accentuation by
 lower lung volumes, especially since cardiac echo was normal in ___. Repeat
 chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level could be performed for
 confirmation. Alternatively, it if cardiovascular symptoms or signs are
 present, repeat echo could be performed
 2.  No pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___
 QA nurses via email on ___ at 10:03 AM.
