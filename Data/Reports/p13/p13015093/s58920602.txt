 INDICATION:  Right lower chest wall pain, status post blunt trauma.  Evaluate
 for fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The bony
 thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.

 concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series can be obtained, including
