                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Ill-defined interstitial and nodular opacities within both upper lobes lung
 fields with associated peribronchial cuffing may reflect an infectious or
 inflammatory process.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Deformity of the left humeral head may reflect remote
 trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Ill-defined interstitial and nodular opacities in both upper lung fields with
 peribronchial cuffing could reflect a small airways infectious or inflammatory
 process.
