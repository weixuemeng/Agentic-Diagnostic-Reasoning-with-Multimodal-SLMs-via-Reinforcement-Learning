                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Increased biapical reticulonodular opacities are again noted with possible
 bronchiectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Significant
 deformity of the left humeral head is likely due to prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Biapical reticulonodular opacities with bronchiectasis, similar
 in appearance to recent prior examination.  Consider CT scan for further
 evaluation given persistent imaging findings.
