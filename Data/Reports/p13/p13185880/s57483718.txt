                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rapid AFib, rule out infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Comparison to chest x-rays from ___.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution with mild diffuse vascular blurring.  There
 are increased interstitial markings at both lung bases, which have progressed
 compared with ___.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion is
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, progressed compared with ___.  These likely
 represent chronic interstitial infiltrates or bronchiectasis, but the
 possibility of a more acute infectious infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
 2.  Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF and no effusion.
