                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and epigastric discomfort, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are again seen.  The lungs are clear.  A subtle opacity
 obscuring the left heart border is likely a fat pad and is stable from prior. 
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing signs of pneumonia.  Presumed fat pad abutting the
 left heart border accounting for the stable opacity at this level.
