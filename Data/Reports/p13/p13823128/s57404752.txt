                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with syncope, to rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 The lung volumes are low.  Right lower lobe peribronchial consolidation may
 represent aspiration or infection. Also seen is mild fullness of the right
 hilum and opacity of the normally clear infrahilar window on the lateral CXR.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
   
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar peribronchial consolidation, which may represent
 acute aspiration or infection. Questionable lymphadenopathy in right hilar and
 subcarinal regions is difficult to evaluate on lateral CXR due to low lung
 volumes. Repeat CXR with improved inspiratory level is recommended for initial
 further evaluation.
  
 Findings discussed with Dr.___ at 9:25 A.M on ___.
