                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with question of altered mental status after fall
 from standing, hypoxic, elevated white count
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal
 hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy
 opacities are noted in both lung bases in the setting of low lung volumes
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities in the setting of low lung volumes likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Early infection is not completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
