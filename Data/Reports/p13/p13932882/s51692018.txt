                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, history of multifocal pneumonia.  Assess for
 cardiopulmonary disease or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate persistent
 retrocardiac and left mid lung opacification which may represent atelectasis,
 though pneumonia is still a consideration.  There is interval improved
 aeration of the right lung base likely due to improved inspiration. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent retrocardiac and left mid lung opacification could be
 consistent with mild pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
