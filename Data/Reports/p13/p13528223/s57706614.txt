                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Delirium with dementia and rising white blood cell count.  Please
 assess for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is rotated.  Despite consideration of patient positioning,
 there is a new abnormal configuration to the mediastinum and right hilum. 
 Given rapidity of development, diagnostic consideration if given to pulmonary
 parenchymal collapse or possibly mediastinal hematoma.  Minimal right lower
 lung opacification is not significantly changed compared to ___ and may
 represent chronic change.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  No
 displaced rib fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Change in mediastinal contour compared to ___, greater
 than expected given change in patient position and lung volumes.  Recommend
 further evaluation with chest CT to rule out mediastinal injury.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated findings to Dr. ___ at 11 o'clock
