 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a prominent epicardial fat
 pad.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Irregular lung architecture suggests
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is no definite pleural effusion. 
 Minimal anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body is likely chronic. 
 The bones appear demineralized.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting obstructive pulmonary disease; however, no
 definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
