 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with acute renal failure, evaluate for
 cardiomegaly and/or volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 normal size, and mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Indentation of the
 trachea may relate to an enlarged thyroid gland.  Lungs are clear.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. No evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema.
 2. Indentation of the trachea may relate to an enlarged thyroid gland and
 should be clinically correlated.
