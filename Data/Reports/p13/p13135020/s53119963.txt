                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post CABG presenting with left chest
 tightness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re-identified are multiple median sternotomy wires consistent with prior CABG.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The hila are within normal limits.  Lung volumes are low. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Linear opacity
 at the right and left lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The right internal jugular vein catheter
 has been removed.  At lower lung volumes, a platelike atelectasis is seen at
 the right lung basis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
