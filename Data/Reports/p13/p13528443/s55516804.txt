                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ hx of STEMI ___, HTN, and DM s/p systemic TPA for left
 MCA stroke due to a left ICA origin occlusion.  // please evaluate for
 aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is moderately enlarged. There is low lung volumes with volume
 loss at the bases. The left hemidiaphragm is ill-defined and is unclear if
 this is due to volume loss/ infiltrate/effusion. There is mild pulmonary
 vascular redistribution.  The superior mediastinum is prominent but this may
 be secondary to projection. It would be helpful to the compared old films if
 available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity due to volume loss/ infiltrate/effusion.  Prominent
 superior mediastinum .
