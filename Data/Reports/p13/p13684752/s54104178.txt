                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with intubation.  Post-arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two frontal radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  It appears that there are two successive radiographs presented for
 evaluation.  The first is acquired at 7:09 a.m., the second at 7:12 a.m. An
 overlying trauma board obscures parts of the patient.
 
 The initial radiograph demonstrates a right main stem intubation.  On the
 second radiograph, the ET tube has been retracted slightly but continues to
 reside in the right mainstem. Right-sided IJ terminates in appropriate
 position.  Hyperlucent left hemithorax with deep sulcus suggests pneumothorax.
 Dense right-sided parenchymal opacities are probably a combination of
 atelectasis and aspiration; pneumonia should be considered as well.  There is
 a right-sided pleural effusion. The heart size is normal.  Aortic
 calcifications are noted. Multiple left-sided rib cage deformities worrisome
 for fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable large left-sided pneumothorax with multiple left-sided rib
 deformities.
 2.  ET tube continues to reside in the right mainstem bronchus even status
 post retraction.
 3.  Large right-sided parenchymal opacity consistent with a combination of
 atelectasis, aspiration and possibly pneumonia.  Also small right-sided
 pleural effusion.
 
 Please correlate findings with the subsequent chest CT. By the time of review
 of this radiograph, a subsequent radiograph demonstrated ET tube above the
 carina and left sided chest tube.
