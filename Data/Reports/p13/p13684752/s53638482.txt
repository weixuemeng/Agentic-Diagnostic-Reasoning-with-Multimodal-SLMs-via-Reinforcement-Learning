                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 1.1 cm above the carina, but it
 has subsequently been withdrawn to a standard position on subsequently
 dictated chest radiograph under separate clip ___.  Other indwelling
 devices are in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Interval improvement in extent of bilateral asymmetrically distributed
 perihilar airspace opacities, which remain more prominent on the right than
 the left.  These findings are most likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema,
 but followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude underlying
 pneumonia.  Left chest tube remains in place with a small apicolateral left
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed
 compared to previous radiograph.
