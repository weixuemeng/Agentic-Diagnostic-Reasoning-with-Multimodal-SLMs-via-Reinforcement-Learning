                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:11 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New shortness of breath, hypoxia, tachycardia and tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion which developed between ___ and ___ is now accompanied by relatively symmetric perihilar pulmonary
 opacification, findings that are most readily explained by pulmonary edema,
 even though the heart is normal size and pleural effusion if any is no larger.
 Pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are possibilities, but neither is likely to
 produce the symmetric distribution of opacification seen currently.
