                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent infiltrate seen on chest radiograph.  Question pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and hilar diameters have increased since
 ___ and small bilateral pleural effusions are new, indicating mild
 cardiac decompensation.  On the lateral view, there is greater opacification
 at the lung bases, but it is unclear whether this is an early edema or mild
 pneumonia.  I discussed with the referring physician my recommendation to
 treat the patient's cardiac decompensation and repeat chest conventional chest
 radiographs afterwards.  The upper lungs show no findings of pneumonia.  Heart
 is only top normal size.
