                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD  // please assess for any
 cardiopulmonary abnormalitites.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent increase in size of the left hilus could be due to lymph node
 enlargement or tortuous vessels projecting over the normal hilus. There is no
 evidence of lymph node enlargement elsewhere in the chest.    CT scanning
 would be definitive in determining at adenopathy in most locations, but may be
 equivocal with regard to the hilus if the patient cannot tolerate intravenous
 contrast agent.
 
 Heart size previously quite large, is now normal. Lungs are clear and there is
 no pleural abnormality.
