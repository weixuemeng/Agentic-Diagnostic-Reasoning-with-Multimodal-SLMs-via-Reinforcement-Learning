                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural
 effusion.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 The appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged including right upper lobe
 consolidation and relatively elevated right hemidiaphragm most likely
 reflecting the presence of known subpulmonic pleural effusion.  Left lung is
 clear.  Mediastinal position, contour and width are unchanged.  Overall no
 substantial change since the prior examination is demonstrated.
