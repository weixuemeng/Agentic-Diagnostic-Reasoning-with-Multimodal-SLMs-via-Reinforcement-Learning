                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior exam dated ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Previously noted
 PICC line has been removed.  A calcified granuloma is again noted in the right
 mid lung.  There is mildly increased linear density at the left lung base
 which is most compatible with atelectasis given the associated volume loss. 
 Mild atelectasis is also noted at the right medial lung base.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  No convincing signs of pneumonia.  No
 effusion.  In the upper abdomen, metallic stents are present as well as
 several surgical clips.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis without convincing signs of pneumonia. 
 Interval removal of PICC line.
