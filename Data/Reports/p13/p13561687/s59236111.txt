                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chemotherapy and fever.  History of liver cancer.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  A biliary
 catheter is visualized in the partly imaged right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Thick
 band-like opacities are present at each lung base; although not specific,
 these are most suggestive of atelectasis.  A calcified nodule projects over
 the right lateral mid lung.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense band-like opacities in the lower lungs which have a
 morphology most suggestive of atelectasis.  If pneumonia is a continuing
 possible clinical concern, a short-term followup radiographs may be helpful
 and pneumonia is not entiredly excluded.
