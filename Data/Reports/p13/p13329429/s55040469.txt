                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of lung adenocarcinoma presenting
 with CVA, now intubated.  Evaluation for line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___, and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates 2
 cm above the level of the carina.  Recommend proximal repositioning by at
 least 2 cm.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and is at least
 within the stomach, though the tip is incompletely imaged.  Widening of the
 mediastinal contours corresponds with patient's known adenopathy.  Known
 pulmonary masses within the right upper lobe and right lower lobe are not well
 characterized on this examination.  There is no new consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  A
 moderate-sized hiatal hernia is stable.  Compression deformity and
 vertebroplasty of the T11 vertebral body is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube 2 cm from the carina.  Proximal repositioning by at
 least 2 cm is recommended.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube at least within the stomach
 
 3.  Known mediastinal adenopathy and pulmonary masses appear stable.
 
 4.  Stable moderate hiatal hernia and compression deformity of T11.
