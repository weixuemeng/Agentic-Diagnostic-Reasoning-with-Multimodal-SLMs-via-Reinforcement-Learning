                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity suggests minor atelectasis or
 perhaps chronic scarring.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
