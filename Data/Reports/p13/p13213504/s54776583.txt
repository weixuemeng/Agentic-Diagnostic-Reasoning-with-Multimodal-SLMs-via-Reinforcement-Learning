                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right facial droop and difficulty swallowing, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, though
 some of this may reflect relatively low lung volumes.  No evidence of vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 Curvilinear line simulating a pleural stripe most likely represents merely
 skinfold.
