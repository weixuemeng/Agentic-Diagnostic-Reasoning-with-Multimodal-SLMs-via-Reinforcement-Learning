                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer with persistent nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is increased
 opacification within the left lower lobe, which given the short time interval,
 likely reflects a combination of the patient's known malignancy with possible
 superimposed pneumonia or aspiration.  There is unchanged pleural thickening
 of the left costophrenic angle.  Right lower lobe lung nodule appears grossly
 unchanged.  Other known lung nodules are not well assessed on the current
 radiograph.  There is no new focal consolidation in the right lung or
 right-sided pleural effusion.  Emphysematous changes are again seen.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  No definite acute osseous abnormalities are present.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification within the left lower lobe likely reflecting a
 combination of known lung malignancy with superimposed infection or
 aspiration.
