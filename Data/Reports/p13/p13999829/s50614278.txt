                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Metastatic cancer with cough, hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Also comparison with ___.  ___ CT.
 
 Left lower lobe opacity is similar in appearance as compared to the prior
 study with possible slight increase superiorly.  Findings could be due to
 worsening of malignancy; however, superimposed infection is not entirely
 excluded, although felt unlikely.  Again seen there is blunting/thickening at
 the left costophrenic angle which may be due to underlying pleural effusion
 and/or pleural thickening.  The lateral right lower lobe nodule is again seen.
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No pneumothorax.
