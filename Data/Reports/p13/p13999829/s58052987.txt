                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with chills, vomiting, asymmetric breath sounds.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with prominence of the
 right hilum compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  2 masses with in the right lower lobe are
 unchanged, and the patient is status post right upper lobectomy and left lower
 lobe wedge resection.  Other known pulmonary nodules with in the right lower
 lobe seen on the previous CT are not as well delineated on the current exam. 
 Focal opacification within the left lower lobe appears similar compared to
 prior radiographs and likely reflects a combination of chronic neoplasm and
 atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged and left pleural
 thickening and fluid is similar.  There is no pneumothorax.   Hazy opacity
 within the right lower lobe also appears improved from the prior radiograph
 and corresponds to ground-glass opacities noted on prior CT.  Emphysematous
 changes with in the left upper lobe are seen. No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic left lower lobe opacity felt to reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and neoplasm. Persistent small right pleural effusions and left pleural
 effusion/thickening.  Improving opacification within the right lower lobe with
 unchanged masses compatible with known malignancy.
