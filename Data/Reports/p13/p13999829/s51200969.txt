                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The increased
 opacification of left lower lobe (representing a combination of the patient's
 known malignancy, pleural thickening, pleural effusion and atelectasis) are
 stable from the prior study.  The right lung is clear of acute focal process;
 however, changes related to the patient's right upper lobectomy are present as
 well as vague lower lung opacity compatible with known nodule.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute process. Chronic changes related to the
 patient's LLL mass as above.
