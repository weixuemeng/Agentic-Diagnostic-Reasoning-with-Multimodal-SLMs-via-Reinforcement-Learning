                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A rounded mass at the right lung base laterally is again seen,, ?
 slightly large, notwithstanding magnifiation compared to the prior film.  It
 measures ~ 3.7 x 4.6 c, on this exam. The exrteme right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the film.   Ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe are
 increased from ___ but similar to the ___ CT.  In
 addition, the left lower lobe opacities in the mid-to-lower lung zones appear
 relatively stable.  Smaller pulmonary nodules in the left mid lung zone are
 again noted, though are slightly blurred on this image. Cardiac size remains
 largely stable. No CHF or pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Since ___, probably worsening right lower lobe ground-glass
 opacities. The possibility of a superimposed pneumonic infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  
 2) The right lower lobe mass is similar, but may be slightly larger, allowing
 for technical differerences.  
 3) Stable left mid-to-lower hemithorax opacities.
