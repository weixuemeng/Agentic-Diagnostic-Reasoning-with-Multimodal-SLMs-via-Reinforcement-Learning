                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Left lower lobe mass-like
 consolidation is smaller, probably due to resorption of hemorrhage after
 biopsy of the large mass.  There is a small left pleural effusion, either
 unchanged or slightly bigger than prior study and adjacent atelectasis.  The
 right lung appears grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion stable. Resolving hemorrhage around
 left lower lobe mass. No evidence for pneumonia. Right lung metastases stable.
 Severe emphysema.
