                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of pneumothorax, status post
 thoracostomy tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from 2:30 p.m.
 earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates interval
 placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, directed toward the upper
 mediastinum on the right, with subsequent reexpansion of the right lung, with
 only a small right apical pneumothorax remaining.  The left lung is clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable, with no evidence of tension or mediastinal shift.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small residual right apical pneumothorax following chest tube
 placement.
