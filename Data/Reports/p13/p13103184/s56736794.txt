                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, anemia, and decreased exercise tolerance.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch
 is calcified.  There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Patchy medial
 right basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative
 changes are similar along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Suspected minor
 right basilar atelectasis.
