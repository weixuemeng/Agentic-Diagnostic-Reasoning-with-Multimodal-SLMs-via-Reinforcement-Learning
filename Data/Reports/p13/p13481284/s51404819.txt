                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Sarcoidosis with increased dyspnea and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Each hilum is enlarged suggesting
 lymphadenopathy.  The right paramediastinal stripe is also widened suggesting
 right paratracheal lymphadenopathy in a pattern fairly typical of sarcoidosis.
 There also a mild central interstitial prominence which may indicate pulmonary
 hypertension although perhaps a sequela of sarcoidosis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal opacification.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, typical but not
 specific for sarcoidosis.  There is a lack of available remote prior studies. 
 Other etiologies such as lymphoma are not excluded.
 
 2.  Suggestion of mild congestive change with mild cardiomegaly.  The
 possibility of underlying cardiac disease should be considered. 
 Echocardiogram may be helpful to evaluate further.
 
 Regarding chest findings, CT may be useful to delineated further; if no prior
 studies are available, short-term follow-up radiographs are suggested.
