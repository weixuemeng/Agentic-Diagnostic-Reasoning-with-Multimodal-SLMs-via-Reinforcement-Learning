                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary hypertension, sarcoid, worsened
 hypoxemia, eval for pulm edema, other process  //  eval for pulm edema, other
 process      eval for pulm edema, other process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Enlargement of the hila and peritracheal region is again seen.  This is
 consistent with the CT combination of prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which
 would be consistent with sarcoidosis, and substantial enlargement of the
 central pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, though there is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  This discordance raises the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy.
