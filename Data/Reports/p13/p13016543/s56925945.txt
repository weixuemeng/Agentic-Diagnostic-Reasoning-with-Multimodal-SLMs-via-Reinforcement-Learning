 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with previous large pneumothorax.  Hypoxia is

 Residual left pneumothorax is very small, and left pleural pigtail catheter
 enters the chest medial to the left mid clavicular line and runs vertically,

 knob.  There is no mediastinal widening.  Heart is not enlarged, but difficult
 to see because of substantial bilateral atelectasis in both lower lungs. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
