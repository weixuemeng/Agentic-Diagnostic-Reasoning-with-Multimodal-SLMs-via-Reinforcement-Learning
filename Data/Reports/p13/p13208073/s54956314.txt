                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with diffuse intraventricular hemorrhage, intubated,
 coarse breath sounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An
 enteric tube courses through the stomach with tip beyond the inferior borders
 of the film. Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged, hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. Compression deformities of 2 adjacent lower thoracic vertebra,
 likely T11 and T12, are of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 3. Age indeterminate compression deformities of 2 distal thoracic vertebral
 bodies, likely T11 and T12.
