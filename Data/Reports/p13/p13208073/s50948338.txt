                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ ruptured ACOM aneurysm  // ? interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Compared to prior study, there is new left lower lung opacity, likely due to
 volume loss. The right heart border also appears to be displaced medially and
 although there is some obliquely of the patient, mediastinal shift related to
 the left lower lung volume loss is certainly a possibility, most likely due to
 mucus plugging. Left subclavian line, endotracheal tube, and enteric tube are
 in unchanged positions.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lung opacity associated with likely left-ward mediastinal
 shift, altogether suggesting volume loss due to mucus plugging.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 10:30 AM, 10 minutes after the images were reviewed.
