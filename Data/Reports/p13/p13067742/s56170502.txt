                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with new AFib and lower extremity
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Linear density projecting over the
 lateral right mid lung may be due to a calcified pleural plaque.  Otherwise,
 no discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There is mild biapical pleural
 thickening.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 relatively hyperinflated, which may be due to underlying chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  There is appearance of tenting of the right hemidiaphragm
 on the frontal view, which may be due to underlying atelectasis/scarring on
 the right.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Possible right-sided pleural plaques with associated scarring/atelectasis.
