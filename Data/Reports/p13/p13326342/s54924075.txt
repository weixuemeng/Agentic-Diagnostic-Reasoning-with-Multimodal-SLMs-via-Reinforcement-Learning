 Evaluate for consolidation or free air under hemidiaphragm.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar linear and subsegmental atelectasis has
 increased.  There is a retrocardiac airspace opacity which is most likely due
 to atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
 The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. Regional bones and
 soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New retrocardiac opacification is most likely due to atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
