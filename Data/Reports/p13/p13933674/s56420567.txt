                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, status post left partial nephrectomy,
 chest tube, NG tube.  Check.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  The pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat
 increased, but this is probably the result of a poor inspirational effort and
 crowded appearance of the vascular structures.  The diaphragms are relatively
 high positioned indicative of poor inspirational effort.  Hazy density on the
 bases probably mostly related to patient's rather prominent adiposity.  No
 conclusive evidence for pleural effusion or new acute infiltrates.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly but no evidence of acute pulmonary
 abnormalities.
