                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right chest tube at waterseal. 
 Postoperative day one status post partial left nephrectomy, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON: ___. 
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with accentuation of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may represent small
 pleural effusion.  Minimal opacification of the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base is noted.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The left chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  A possible feeding tube cannot be completely traced.
