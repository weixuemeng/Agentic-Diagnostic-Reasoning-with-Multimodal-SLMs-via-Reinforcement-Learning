                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increasing sob, improved pleural effusion
 after thoracentesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mediastinal shift
 to the left.  In addition, there is a right basilar and right upper lung
 opacity.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mild mediastinal shift
 to the left, findings consistent with complete collapse of the left lung.
 2. Focal right upper lung opacity could represent infection, but neoplasm
 cannot be excluded.
 3. Right basilar opacity, could represent infection/aspiration or atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT could further assess right upper lung opacity and
 cause for left lung collapse.
