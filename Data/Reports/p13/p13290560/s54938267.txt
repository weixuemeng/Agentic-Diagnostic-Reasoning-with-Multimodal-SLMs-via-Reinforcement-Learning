                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with previous large L malignant effusion  //
 assess for interval change, reaccumulation of effusion; any evidence of
 pneumothorax     assess for interval change, reaccumulation of effusion; any
 evidence of pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph ___ at 10:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, given differences in positioning, there is no significant interval
 change of near complete opacification of the left hemi-thorax, although there
 is some aeration in the left upper lung.  This likely reflects a combination
 of consolidation/atelectasis and to a lesser degree, pleural fluid, especially
 when correlated with CT dated ___.  The mass in the right upper lobe is
 again seen and consistent with primary lung malignancy when correlated with CT
 ___ ___.  Patchy opacities at the right lung base more likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis rather than superimposed pneumonia.  Interval removal of
 bibasilar pigtail pleural catheters.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the opacification of the
 left hemi-thorax.
