                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LMS obstruction (mucous plug) s/p flex
 bronch w cleanout and right chest tube placed with 420mL out  // ? PTX on R,
 expansion of lung on L
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph from earlier today, the left hemi thorax is
 now nearly completely opacified, likely due to worsening near-complete
 collapse of the left lung as well as a known coexist existing left pleural
 effusion with pigtail pleural catheter in place.  Interval placement of
 right-sided chest tube with near resolution of right pleural effusion and
 development of a small lateral right pneumothorax.  Large mass in the right
 apex is unchanged and has been more fully evaluated by a recent chest CT.
