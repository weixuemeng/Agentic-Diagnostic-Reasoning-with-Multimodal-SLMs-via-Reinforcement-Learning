 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including a widening of the vascular pedicle,
 tortuosity of the aorta and atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is a mild
 diffuse interstitial abnormality which suggests background mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion that is newly prominent.  Left basilar opacity has mostly
 resolved, however.  It is difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions but
 none are explicitly demonstrated.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are noted
 throughout the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
