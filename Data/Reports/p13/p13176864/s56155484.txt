                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Central venous line placed, check position.
 
 The right subclavian line has gone into the internal jugular vein and its tip
 cannot be seen.
 
 Focal opacities are again noted within both the right and left lobes and a
 right effusion is likely present.  These could represent a patchy
 bronchopneumonia rather than resolving failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central line in right neck.
