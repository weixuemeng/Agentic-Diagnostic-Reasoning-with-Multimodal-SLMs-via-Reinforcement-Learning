                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery
 disease, now with concern for pulmonary fibrosis versus volume overload;
 recent diuresis performed.
 
 STUDY:  AP portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Again are seen diffuse areas of ground-glass opacities
 are similar to slightly improved in extent from prior exam.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary consolidation is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse ground-glass opacities with minimal improvement after
 diuresis most compatible with either an atypical infection or inflammatory
 process.
