                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Substernal chest pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.  Diffuse ground-glass
 airspace opacities are noted in both lungs with mild perihilar haziness.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema. An underlying atypical infectious process is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting and follow up radiographs after
 diuresis are recommended.
