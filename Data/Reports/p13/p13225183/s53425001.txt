 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There continues to be evidence of a right
 upper lobectomy with volume loss on the right side.  There is central vascular
 congestion which is not significantly changed, although there are some
 slightly more prominent interstitial markings in the periphery of the left
 lung which could reflect early mild interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation
 is advised.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
