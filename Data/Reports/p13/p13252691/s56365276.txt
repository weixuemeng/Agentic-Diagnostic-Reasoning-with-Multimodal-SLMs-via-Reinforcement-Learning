                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post motor vehicle accident with large
 abdominal laceration.  Evaluate for intrathoracic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CT torso with contrast.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Artifact from trauma board is present.  The lung volumes are low,
 accounting for some bronchovascular crowding, but there is no focal
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Although this study is limited for
 assessment of osseous structures, there is no evidence of rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low lung volumes.
