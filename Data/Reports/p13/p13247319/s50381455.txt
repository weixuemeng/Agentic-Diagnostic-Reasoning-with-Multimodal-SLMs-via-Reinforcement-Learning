                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, crackles at bases, left
 greater than right.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The lungs are
 normally expanded and clear, apart from minimal linear bibasilar opacities
 which reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal and symmetric.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The aorta
 is somewhat tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  On the
 lateral view, there are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with
 anterior and posterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality by radiography.
