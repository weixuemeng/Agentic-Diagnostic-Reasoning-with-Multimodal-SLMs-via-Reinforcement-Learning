                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends into the antrum of the stomach. 
 There has been substantial decrease in the degree of pulmonary edema,
 presumably related to diuresis.  Otherwise, little change.
