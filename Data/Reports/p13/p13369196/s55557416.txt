 removal
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Following removal of right pleural catheter, there is no evidence of apical
 pneumothorax. Small pockets of gas in the retrosternal region on the lateral
 view could potentially represent small loculated hydro pneumothoraces. A
 multiloculated right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.
 Additionally, right juxta hilar and left retrocardiac opacities have slightly
 worsened. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema in
 right supraclavicular region is minimally improved.
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___ radiograph.
