                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p tracheobronchoplasty, POD 8  // pls eval
 interval change      pls eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 09:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 831 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a developing airspace opacity in the right upper lung which would be
 concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. In addition, linear opacity in the
 right mid lung and at the left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.  A small layering right effusion is likely unchanged. The
 retrotracheal mediastinal structure indenting the posterior tracheal wall on
 the lateral view is stable possibly related to recent surgery. Clinical
 correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax.
