                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent tracheobronchoplasty, POD 7  // pls
 perform non-portable PA and lateral films to assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases is stable on the right, increased
 slightly on the left over the past 2 days. A right pleural collection, with
 basal and fissural components is probably unchanged.  The persistence of the
 pleural fluid in the major fissure makes it difficult to determine whether
 there is also consolidation in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe,
 projecting just below the clavicle on the frontal view.  Lateral view shows
 persistence of a retrotracheal mediastinal structure indenting the posterior
 tracheal wall, presumably a function of the surgical repair.
 
 CT scanning would be helpful in assessment of both the trachea and possible
 right upper lobe consolidation.
 
 Heart size is normal and there is no evidence of cardiac decompensation.
