                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with post-op tracheobronchoplasty with mesh  // eval lungs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Residual linear densities in the
 right infrahilar and right lung base likely represent residual areas of
 scarring/ atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. The previously noted
 consolidation in the right upper lobe is resolved. A calcified nodular
 structure projects over the left apex. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures are intact. No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear densities in the right mid to lower lung likely represents atelectasis
 versus scarring. Previously noted right upper lobe pneumonia has resolved.
