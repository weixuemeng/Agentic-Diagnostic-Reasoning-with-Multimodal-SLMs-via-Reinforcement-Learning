                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent multifocal pneumonia, assess for clearance.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Previous heterogeneous opacity
 in the left lung has resolved, and substantially cleared from the right lower
 lung.  However, there is a small round opacity at the lateral right lung base.
 Compared to prior study, patient is slightly rotated to the left and this
 opacity may conform to a similar finding on the previous film. It is unclear
 whether this is a nodule or residual opacity from prior pneumonia.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previous pneumonia has almost entirely resolved. 
 
 Repeat chest radiographs in four weeks indicated for to distinguish possible
 right lower lobe nodule from residual pneumonia.  Radiologist should review
 images before patient leaves the department to see if oblique views are
 needed.
