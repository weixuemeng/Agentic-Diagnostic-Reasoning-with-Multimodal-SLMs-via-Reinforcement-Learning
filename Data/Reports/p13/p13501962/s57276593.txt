                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and abdominal distention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Streaky linear opacities in the bases are compatible
 with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Interposition of the colon between the diaphragm and
 liver is noted on the right.  Distended bowel loops are partially imaged
 within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
