 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with morbid obesity after
 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and now with dyspnea.

 mediastinal silhouette.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Right costophrenic
 angle was excluded from the field of view on the first view and on the second
 view as well but no gross abnormality is demonstrated.
