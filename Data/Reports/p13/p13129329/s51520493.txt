                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with back pain, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low.  This results in exaggeration of the cardiac
 silhouette size which is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases
 most likely are reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly low lung volumes.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities most likely
 reflect atelectasis.
