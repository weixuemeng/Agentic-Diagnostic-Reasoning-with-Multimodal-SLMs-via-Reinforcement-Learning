                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SS anemia with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size or
 slightly enlarged.  There is some prominence of pulmonary interstitial
 markings.  It is unclear whether this could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure or, in view of the clinical history, possibly increase the
 pulmonary arterial flow.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 
 No evidence of bony stigmata of sickle cell disease.
