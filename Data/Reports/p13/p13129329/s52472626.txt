                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute chest syndrome s/p exchange
 transfusion. On vent. Being treated for HCAP.  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral diffuse
 pulmonary opacities have slightly improved, particularly in the left lung.  A
 new elliptical opacity in the right mid lung could potentially be due to
 loculated intra fissure all fluid although a a coalescent region of airspace
 consolidation from either asymmetrical edema or infection is also possible. 
 No other relevant changes.
