  IMPRESSION:  
  
  1.  Perihilar opacification in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. 
  Short-term followup radiographs are recommended after treatment, however, in
  order to ensure complete resolution and exclude a coinciding obstructing
  lesion.  
  
  2.  Smooth oval opacity projecting over the right lower lung, suspected to
  represent a nipple shadow.  When short-term follow-up radiographs are
  performed, preferably with PA and lateral technique if possible, an additional
  PA view with nipple markers may be helpful to evaluate further.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and fever.  Patient on chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous and
 partly calcified, particularly along the arch.  There is a patchy right hilar
 opacity including an infrahilar component.  There is also background increased
 interstitial markings in the right lung compared to the left side.  There is
 no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The right major fissure appears
 slightly thickened, however.  Projecting over the right lower lung is an oval
 nodule, although suspected to reflect a nipple shadow. 
 
 The bones appear demineralized including a mild biconcave compression
 deformity along the lower thoracic vertebral body as well as a
 mild-to-moderate superior endplate compression deformity of the lower thoracic
 vertebral body with a concave shape.  The chronicity of these is uncertain,
 but they are not necessarily recent or acute.  Background bony
 demineralization is noted without clear focal lesions.  Patchy vascular
 calcifications project over the epigastric region.
