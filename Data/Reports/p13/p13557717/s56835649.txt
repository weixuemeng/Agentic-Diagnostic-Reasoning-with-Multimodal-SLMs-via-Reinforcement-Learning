 Extrapleural mass in the right upper hemithorax is probably related to the
 destructive lesion in the lateral aspect of the right third rib, whether mass
 alone or mass and bleeding.  There is no pleural effusion.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is chronic.  Aside from mild left basal atelectasis, lungs are
 clear.  Thoracic aorta is generally large but not focally aneurysmal.  There
 is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Lateral view shows mild to
 moderate compression of vertebral bodies in the mid and lower thoracic spine.
