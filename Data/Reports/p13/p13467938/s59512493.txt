                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of cancer, who now presents with cough,
 shortness of breath, and hypotension.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___.  CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  The left lung base
 opacities obscure left hemidiaphragm.  Associated small left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Mnild right bsae
 atelectasis is also seen. No pneumothorax is noted.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Mild perihilar vascular congestion is seen. 
 Heart size is normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight prominence of the hila, could be due to vascular engorgement. Bibasilar
 opacities could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
