                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal distention, gallbladder cancer, recent ERCP, assess NG
 tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.  Low lung volumes.  An NG tube is present -- the tip
 extends beneath diaphragm, off film.  The sideport overlies the expected site
 of the gastric fundus.  A left IJ central line is present -- the tip overlies
 the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bibasilar atelectasis is
 likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.  The possibility of pneumonic
 infiltrates would be difficult to exclude in this setting.  Doubt CHF.
