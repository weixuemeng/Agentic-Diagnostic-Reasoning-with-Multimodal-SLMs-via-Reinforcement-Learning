 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:   status post chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the apical pneumothorax is
 not clearly seen, given overlay of the clavicle and the left lung apex. 
 However, there is a new linear lucency at the left lung bases, likely
 reflecting a pleural air collection.  The pre-existing atelectasis at the left
 lung base is improved.  Unchanged appearance of the right lung.
