                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with body stiffness spreading through all of her
 joints and also her neck.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusions.  Lateral view demonstrates an enlarged posterior cardiac margin. 
 Differential includes left atrial enlargement, subcarinal bronchogenic cyst or
 possible adenopathy if the patient has a known extrathoracic malignancy.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderately enlarged posterior cardiac margin of uncertain etiology. 
 Likely atrial enlargement or possibly a bronchogenic cyst, though adenopathy
 is within the differential if there is known extrathoracic malignancy. 
 Comparison with prior images would be helpful to further characterize.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly
