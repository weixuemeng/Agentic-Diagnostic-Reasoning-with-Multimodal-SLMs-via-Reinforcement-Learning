                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post cardiac arrest with endotracheal tube
 and left subclavian line.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 2.0 cm above the carina.  Left subclavian central catheter terminates in the
 right atrium.  Heart size is top normal.  Low lung volumes simulates vascular
 congestion, and severe left lower lobe atelectasis explains leftward
 mediastinal shift.  Blunting of left costophrenic angle suggests a small left
 pleural effusion.  Interstitial abnormality at the base of the right lung,
 including microcalcifications, is chronic. No pneumothorax. Stomach is
 severely distended with air and fluid; no NGT in place. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.0 cm above the carina, 2.0 cm below optimal
 position.  Stomach distended; no NGT.  
 
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse.
 
 3.  Chronic interstial pulmonary abnormality. 
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by ___ to ___ on
