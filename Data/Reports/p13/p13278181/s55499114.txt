                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion after aggressive IVF.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 4:31 a.m.
 
 A right IJ PICC line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  
 
 Slightly low inspiratory volumes. Heart size is  stable, borderline versus
 slightly enlarged. There is increased retrocardiac density, with partial
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, some focal opacity at the left base
 laterally and possible slight blunting of the costophrenic angle.  These
 findings have progressed compared with the ___ study.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution suggesting mild pulmonary congestion.  No
 overt CHF.  There is linear atelectasis in the right mid zone.  The previously
 seen right base nodular opacity is not appreciated on this exam.  Otherwise,
 no focal infiltrate and no right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular plethora similar, possibly slightly improved,
 compared with prior study.
 
 2.  Developing left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with equivocal
 small left effusion.
 
 3.  Previously seen right mid/lower zone rounded opacity not visualized on the
 current exam, though this is of indeterminate significance.
