                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of sepsis, new right IJ placement.  Please evaluate for
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal. Mild vascular congestion and subtle
 interstitial abnormality are most readily explained by mild pulmonary edema.
 Note is made of a nodular opacity projecting over the posterior right 6th rib,
 measuring 5-mm. Right-sided IJ terminates in the low SVC. There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided IJ terminates in low SVC. No pneumothorax or other
 complication.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  5-mm nodular opacity projecting over the right posterior 6th rib may be
 secondary to a pulmonary calcification or a bone-island within the rib;
 further attention on subsequent radiographs is recommended.
 
 ___ were d/w Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 8:___a on the day of
