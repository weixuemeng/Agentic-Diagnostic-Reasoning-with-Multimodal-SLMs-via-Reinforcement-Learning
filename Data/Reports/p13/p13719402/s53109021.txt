                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from two hours earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  V-tach, assess overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  Bibasilar
 opacity, mild and likely reflects atelectasis, though small effusions are
 impossible to exclude.  Patient is rotated to the right, which limits
 evaluation.  Allowing for technical limitations, there is no definite sign of
 pulmonary edema or new consolidation since prior exam.  The heart size cannot
 be assessed.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar opacity in the setting of low lung volumes could
 represent small effusion or atelectasis. Limited due to rotation.  No
 significant change from prior.
