                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with clot in the right upper extremity. Erythema to
 area.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. The
 inferior-most mediastinal wire is broken, unchanged.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged. Aorta is tortuous. Atherosclerotic calcifications are again
 demonstrated at the aortic knob. Lung volumes are lower compared to the
 previous exam. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity likely reflects an area of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 is identified. Assessment of the lung apices is limited by the patient's neck
 and chin projecting over in these areas, but no large pneumothorax is
 identified. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and patchy right basilar opacity, likely
 atelectasis. Pneumonia is not completely excluded and clinical setting.
