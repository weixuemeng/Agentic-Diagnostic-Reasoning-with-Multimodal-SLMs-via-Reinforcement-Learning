                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left upper quadrant pain and 1 week of distention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT abdomen and pelvis from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Rounded opacity within the posterior left aspect of the left lung base
 corresponds to a fat containing diaphragmatic hernia (Bochdalek hernia), as
 seen on the prior CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.  Apart from a linear
 opacity in the right middle lobe which likely reflects scarring, lungs are
 clear.  No pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
