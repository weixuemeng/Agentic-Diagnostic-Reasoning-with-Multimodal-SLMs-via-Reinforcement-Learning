                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCAP.  // assess interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly with normal vasculature,
 suggesting possible pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy. The retrocardiac
 opacification appears less dense, suggesting improvement of atelectasis or
 consolidation.  There is likely a small to moderate left pleural effusion, and
 a small right pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pneumothorax. There is probably an old, well healed fracture of the left
 anterior second rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight decrease in retrocardiac opacity, consistent with improving
 atelectasis or consolidation.
 2. Stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly in the absence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion, suggestive of pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.
