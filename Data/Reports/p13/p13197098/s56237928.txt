                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased from the most
 recent prior study.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal bi-apical
 pleural thickening is noted.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and
 there is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine with mildly
 exaggerated kyphotic curvature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Multilevel DJD of the thoracic spine.
