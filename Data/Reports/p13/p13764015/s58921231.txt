                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recent central line placement, here to
 evaluate position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately 1 hr earlier.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter with the tip terminating in the mid to lower right atrium, which
 should be retracted 5 cm to place in the low SVC. An enteric tube terminates
 in the lower esophagus, which should be advanced for proper positioning. The
 lung volumes remain low. There is right basilar opacification.  No significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the right
 atrium should be retracted 5 cm to place in the low SVC.
 2. Enteric tube in the lower esophagus should be advanced for proper
 positioning so that it terminates in the stomach.
 3. Low lung volumes with right basilar atelectasis or pneumonia.
