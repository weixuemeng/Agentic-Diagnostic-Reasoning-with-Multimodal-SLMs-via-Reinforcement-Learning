 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent aspiration pna now s/p NG tube
 placement.  // Advanced by 10cm, assess for NG tube placement      Advanced by
 10cm, assess for NG tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph ___, 17:02.  . .
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Esophageal drainage tube ends in the distal portion of a nondistended stomach.
 Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  New opacification in the right lung,
 most pronounced in the lower lobe is consistent with acute aspiration.  It
 should also be noted that heart size, though still normal, has increased in
 the interim, and pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins are larger
 caliber than earlier.  This could reflect early cardiac decompensation
