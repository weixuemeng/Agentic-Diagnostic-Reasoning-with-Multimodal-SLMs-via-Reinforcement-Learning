                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated with ongoing fevers, h/o recurrent
 aspiration PNAs.  // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  APsingle view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Lines and Tubes: Endotracheal tube is 2.4 cm above the carina, in unchanged
 position.  Enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm, distal tip not
 visualized.  Left PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Lungs: The lung volumes are low, however compared to the prior radiograph
 there is interval improved aeration.  Persistent right upper and bilateral
 lower lobe linear and patchy opacities with interval improvement.
 
 Pleura: There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 
 Mediastinum: No change in cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 Bony thorax: No interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent low lung volumes with mild interval improvement in aeration and
 improving right upper and bibasilar opacities.  These opacities could
 represent foci of atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonitis.  There is no
 lobar consolidation.
