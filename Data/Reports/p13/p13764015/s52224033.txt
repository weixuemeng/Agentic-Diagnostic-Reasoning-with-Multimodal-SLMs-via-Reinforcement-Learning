                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate enteric tube placement, in a patient with hypoxic
 respiratory failure and concern for enteric tube malpositioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the enteric to
 the extending below the diaphragm and terminating in the distal stomach.  The
 enteric tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea and the left PICC is
 unchanged in position.  The lungs are incompletely imaged.  There is improved
 aeration of the left base, with improvement of the retrocardiac opacity. 
 Other parenchymal opacities appear unchanged.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The enteric tube terminates in the stomach.
 2. Improvement of retrocardiac opacity and left base aeration.  Other
 parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
