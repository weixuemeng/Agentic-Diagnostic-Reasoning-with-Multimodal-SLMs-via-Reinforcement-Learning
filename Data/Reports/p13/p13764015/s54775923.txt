                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman s/p intubation  // eval ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation is limited due to patient rotation with resultant accentuation of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube
 terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet approximately 3.7 cm above the
 carina. An enteric tube terminates in the lower esophagus, which should be
 advanced for proper positioning. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. The
 right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. There is right basilar
 opacification. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube terminating 3.7 cm above the carina.
 2.  Enteric tube in the lower esophagus should be advanced for proper
 positioning.
