                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aspiration pneumonias. // Assess for NG
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is substantially rotated.  The newly placed NG tube can be traced
 to the level of the GE junction.  A left PICC line terminates in the mid SVC,
 unchanged.  The chin and overlying soft tissues obscures the left lung apex. 
 The differential opacification of the right hemithorax relative to the left
 may be positional. There is no new consolidation or pleural effusion. The
 heart mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.  No right
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New nasogastric tube can be traced to the level of the GE junction.  The exact
 location of the tip cannot be confirmed on this suboptimal study. A repeat
 examination with attention to proper patient positioning is suggested.
