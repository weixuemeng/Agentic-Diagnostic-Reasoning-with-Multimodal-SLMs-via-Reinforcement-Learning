                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent aspiration pneumonias.  //
 Assess for NG tube placement, please take facemask and other lines off of lung
 fields.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present.  It is difficult to trace beyond the level of the GE
 junction, though this may be related to underpenetration.  Suggest repeat
 films centered at the level of the diaphragms.
 
 An additional iatrogenic structure overlies the mediastinum,?  mask.  Again
 seen is left-sided PICC line with tip over mid SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy opacity at both lung
 bases, with air bronchograms at the left base.  Finding at the left lung base
 have worsened compared with ___ at 12:05.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild vascular plethora.  Hazy opacity seen previously seen
 in the right lung is slightly improved, but as noted above, opacity at the
 right base is slightly worse.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tip of NG tube not well delineated.  Consider repeat films centered at the
 hemidiaphragms, with increased x-ray beam penetration.
 2. New left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonic
 infiltrate.
 3. New increased opacity at the right base, though the previously seen diffuse
 right lung opacity appears somewhat improved.
 4. Vascular plethora, suspect CHF.
