                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, evaluate endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Endotracheal tube is in
 place, 1.3 cm cranial to the carina and should be withdrawn by 2-3 cm.  A
 right-sided chest tube is in place but appears suboptimally positioned with
 excessive angulation at the side port.  There are bibasilar right greater than
 left parenchymal opacities, likely representing atelectasis.  There is no
 large effusion.  There is a tiny right sided pneumothorax inferior to the
 chest tube entry site
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.3 cm cranial to the carina and should be
 pulled back by 2-3 cm.  
 2. Bibasilar right greater than left opacities could represent either
 atelectasis or aspiration.
 3. Suboptimal positioning of right chest tube along with small pneumothorax
 inferior to chest tube entry site.
