  Tip of the  right internal jugular line projects over the low SVC.  There is
  no pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Moderate to severe thoracic scoliosis
  distorts the anatomy. Tiny  left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Thorazine overdose, now new shortness of breath and
 tachypnea.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier at 05:23 a.m.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged allowing severe right scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of new abnormalities developed in
 the interim.  No pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion demonstrated.
