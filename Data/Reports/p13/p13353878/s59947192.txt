                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
 appearance of a left upper lung perihilar 5-cm mass-like opacity.  The extent
 of the opacity is unchanged as compared the previous image.  The opacity could
 represent both pneumonia or malignancy.  Repeat followup chest x-ray should
 document complete resolution.  Otherwise, CT of the thorax is advised.
