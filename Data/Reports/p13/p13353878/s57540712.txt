 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Previously

 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged, with left ventricular
 configuration.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There is an old rib
 deformity/fracture of the posterior lateral left seventh rib, also seen on the
 prior chest CT.
