 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Right central venous catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new right internal central jugular venous catheter has been
 placed which terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Patchy streaky left
 basilar opacity persists, but now there is also a new mild-to-moderate
 interstitial abnormality including peribronchial cuffing suggesting pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 similar.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction without
 evidence for pneumothorax.
 
 2.  New findings suggesting mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.
