                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Melanoma with brain mets and radiation, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the vascular congestion seen
 on the prior study appears to have decreased.  The hemidiaphragms are not well
 seen.  This could be a technical artifact or reflect small pleural effusions
 with associated atelectatic change.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 persists.
