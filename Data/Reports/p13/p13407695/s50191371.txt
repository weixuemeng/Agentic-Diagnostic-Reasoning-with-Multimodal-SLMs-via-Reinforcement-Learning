                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, single AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is patchy retrocardiac opacity which suggests atelectasis in
 the left lower lobe, similar to prior findings and seen only on one view. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly, as well as mediastinal and hilar contours, appear
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent patchy left basilar opacity probably due to minor
 atelectasis, without definite acute disease.  Subtle pneumonia is difficult to
 entirely exclude at the left lung base, however.
