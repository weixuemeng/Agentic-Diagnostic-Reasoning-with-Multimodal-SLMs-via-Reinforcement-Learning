                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall from standing, injury to mouth with teeth
 knocked out.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Relatively low lung
 volumes are noted.  There is a hazy opacity at the left lung base, both
 laterally and posteriorly involving the costophrenic angles.  Elsewhere, lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 definite acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Left basilar opacity may be secondary to
 atelectasis.  Consider repeat with improved inspiratory effort to further
 assess.
