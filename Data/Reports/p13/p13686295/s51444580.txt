                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with AV block.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and generalized pulmonary vascular engorgement have
 worsened, but there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion
 visible on the frontal view.  On the lateral view, we can see a very small
 volume of pleural fluid in the posterior sulci.  Transvenous right ventricular
 pacer lead follows the expected course.  No pneumothorax or mediastinal
 widening.
