                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified.  Mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature and minimal
 prominence of the interstitial markings may be due to central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement with minimal interstitial edema.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is no focal consolidation.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are again seen along the spine.  Surgical clips project
 over the right upper outer hemithorax.  Degenerative changes are seen at the
 shoulder and acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement with minimal interstitial edema.  Top-normal to
 mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
