                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute resp distress; Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema or interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower. Slight interval increase in opacities, particularly in
 the left lung, suggesting asymmetric edema, although aspiration/pneumonia
 cannot be definitely excluded. Atelectasis is worse with slight elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm. The heart is mildly enlarged, more so since yesterday.
 The mediastinal pulmonary vasculature is more prominent. No pneumothorax.
 Clips projecting over the right axilla and supraclavicular region are
 unchanged. Left single lead cardiac device is intact and unchanged in
 position, tip ending in the right ventricle. Aortic knob calcifications are
 unchanged. The thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous or ectatic, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of probably asymmetric edema in the left lung and lower
 lung volumes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Close interval follow-up with radiograph is advised to
 exclude aspiration/pneumonia in left lung.
