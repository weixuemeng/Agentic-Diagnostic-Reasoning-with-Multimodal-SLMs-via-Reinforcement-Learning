                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TV endocarditis. Evaluate for septic emboli.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 A left pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.
 Linear density at the left lung base may represent a cardiac fat pad or a
 small amount of atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence of focal pulmonary
 opacity or septic embolus is identified.   Within the limits of plain film
 radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected. 
 
 Previously seen right-sided PICC line (chest x-ray from ___) is no longer
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No septic emboli detected radiographically,  though early changes
 would likely be radigrqaphically occult.   Probable atelectasis or cardiac fat
 pad, left base.  Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
