 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen left-sided pacemaker and associated leads have been
 removed.  There is no pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear. Lower lung volumes
 could account for the slight increase in heart size, now top normal. The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There are no definite pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Lower lung volumes may account for slight increase in now top normal heart
 size. Followup radiographs are recommended, when feasible.
