                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:07 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new oxygen requirement and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 10:56 p.m.:
 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema may have improved since yesterday.  There
 is no appreciable pleural effusion, and mediastinal veins are only minimally
 dilated.  Combination of sudden severe edema and normal heart size raised the
 possibility of either non-cardiogenic edema such as reaction to transfusion or
 new medication, or cardiogenic edema due to acute myocardial infarction,
 particularly with mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle dysfunction or
 rupture.  Findings were discussed with the medical house officer caring for
 this patient at 9:30 a.m., by telephone.
