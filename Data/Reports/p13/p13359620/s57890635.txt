 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left apical pleural and parenchymal scarriapptave been more fully
 characterize by serial CT scans most recently in ___.  This is most
 likely the sequela of previous radiation therapy in the setting of previous
 left mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.  Associated left upper
 lobe volume loss is also demonstrated.  Right lung and pleural surfaces are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Left hilum remains elevated as
 well as the left hemidiaphragm.  There are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-radiation changes in the left apex as described.  No
 findings to suggest active pulmonary infection.
