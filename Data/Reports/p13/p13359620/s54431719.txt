                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic cough and known fibrosis.  Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips project about the left lateral chest wall in the
 left breast, as before.  The left lung shows similar mild volume loss with
 focal opacity at the medial left lung apex with a patchy distribution, similar
 to prior examinations allowing for differences in technique.  The right lung
 remains clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bony
 structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar left apical opacities.  If more detailed comparison for
 change is needed clinically, then chest CT could be considered.
