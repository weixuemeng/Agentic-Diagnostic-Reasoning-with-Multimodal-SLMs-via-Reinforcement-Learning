                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female transferred from outside hospital, intubated. 
 Assess ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Followup chest radiograph completed on ___ at 1:25
 a.m.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm
 from the carina on the current study, though it has been repositioned on the
 followup examination and is in appropriate position.  There is increasing
 density in the left lung base which may be due to developing pneumonia or an
 aspiration event.  No pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion is identified.
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits on this supine
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube just above the carina, though proximally repositioned on
 followup radiograph.  
 2. Increasing opacification of the left lung base possibly due to developing
 infection or an aspiration event.
