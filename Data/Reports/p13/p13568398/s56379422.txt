                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with copd and lung ca now w/ acute hypoxia and
 SOB  // evaluate for acute process
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right lung base opacity is increased and left lung base opacity is new since
 ___.  The opacity at the right lung base is larger than left.  Findings
 are suggestive of superimposed pulmonary edema in the setting of right lung
 base pneumonia.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Emphysema and biapical scarring are
 similar as before.  Enlarged right hilar silhouette is again noted.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Cardiac silhouette
 is normal size.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing bibasilar opacities as well as small bilateral pleural effusions
 are likely due to increased superimposed pulmonary edema in setting of right
 pneumonia.
