                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary edema,
 followup.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 As compared to ___, the current radiograph demonstrates interval
 improvement of pulmonary edema, substantial with minimal vascular engorgement
 noted on the current study.  Left retrocardiac opacity is still seen and might
 reflect residual edema versus infectious process.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted, mild.  The left internal jugular line tip is slightly low and might
 be pulled back for approximately 1.5 cm to secure its position at the
 cavoatrial junction or above.
