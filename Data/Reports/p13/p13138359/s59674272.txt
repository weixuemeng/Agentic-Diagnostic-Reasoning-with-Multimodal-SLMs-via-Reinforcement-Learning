                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:40 A.M ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxic respiratory failure and septic shock.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 New mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion and increased small left
 pleural effusion probably reflect increased intravascular volume.  The left
 lower lobe has been uniformly consolidated since ___, whether this
 represents atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate, but
 given the large size of the left hilus, it warrants CT evaluation to look for
 hilar adenopathy as well as bronchial occlusion.
 
 ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.  Right internal
 jugular line ends at least 6 cm below the level of the carina, probably in the
 right atrium and would require withdrawal of 2 to 2.5 cm to place it in the
 low SVC.
 
 Findings were discussed by telephone with ___ at 9:40 a.m.
