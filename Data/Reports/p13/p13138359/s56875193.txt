                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with question sepsis, intubated, question tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is present with tip approximately 5 cm from the carina.  NG
 tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 noted. There are bilateral patchy opacities, more prominent at the lung bases
 which may reflect atelectasis, however, infectious process cannot be excluded.
 Small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable. Right humeral head appears slightly inferiorly
 subluxed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ET tube 5 cm above the carina.  NG tube below the diaphragm.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded. Probable small left pleural effusion.
 4.  Possible right humeral head subluxation. Clinical correlation recommended
 and consider dedicated radiographs of the right shoulder for further
 evaluation.
