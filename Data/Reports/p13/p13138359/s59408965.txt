 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Urosepsis and pneumonia, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 mild pulmonary edema have nearly completely resolved.  However, there is an
 ongoing small left pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis.  Borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No parenchymal opacities suggesting
 pneumonia.  The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
