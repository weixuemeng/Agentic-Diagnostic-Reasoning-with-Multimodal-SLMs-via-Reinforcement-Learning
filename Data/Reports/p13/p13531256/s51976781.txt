                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with B/L shoulder pain from being body slammed by a
 patient during a code purple. Tenderness to palpation over the L scapula  //
 Given recent trauma, please evaluate scapulae for signs of fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size at the upper limits of normal.  Aorta is minimally unfolded.  There
 is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Focal densities are seen involving multiple left-sided ribs, suggestive of
 old, healed rib fractures.
 
 Right and left scapulae are grossly unremarkable on these films.
 
 Slight superior endplate scalloping of 1 of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies,
 question T7 is noted, but does not appear acute.  No spondylolisthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process is identified.
 
 Focal densities along the left chest wall are most suggestive of old healed
 rib fractures.  If there is no no history to account for this, then dedicated
 left rib radiographs would be recommended.
 
 The scapulae are within normal limits on these chest radiographs.  If there is
 specific concern for scapular fracture, then dedicated scapular radiographs
 would be recommended.
 
 Slight superior endplate scalloping of 1 of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies,
 question T7 is noted, but does not appear acute.  Again, clinical correlation
 is requested.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is no history of left-sided rib fractures, then
 dedicated left rib radiographs would be recommended.
 
 If clinical suspicion for scapular fracture remains high, then dedicated
 scapular radiographs would be recommended.
