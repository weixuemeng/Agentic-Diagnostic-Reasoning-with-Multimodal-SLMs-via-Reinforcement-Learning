 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p reintubation  // ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs performed 9 hr earlier

 There is again seen an aortic stent graft. Large soft tissue density along the
 left chest is consistent with the patient's known aortic aneurysm.
 Endotracheal tube and right IJ Cordis is unchanged. There is a left
 retrocardiac opacity which is unchanged.  No pneumothoraces are seen. The tip
 of the left basilar chest tube appears to have been advanced more into the
 chest. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
