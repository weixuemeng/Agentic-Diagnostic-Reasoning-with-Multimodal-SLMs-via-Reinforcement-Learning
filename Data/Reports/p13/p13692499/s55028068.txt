 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Ng  // NG placement      NG placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 It is unclear whether an endotracheal tube is in place.  Esophageal drainage
 tube ends in the stomach and would need to be advanced about 10 cm to move all
 the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged, pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature is engorged and mild edema is
 present in the right lower lobe.  Pleural effusion is presumed, but not
 substantial.
