                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with re-demonstration of fracture of the most inferior wire. 
 Patient is also status post CABG. Low lung volumes are present. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  There is
 likely mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung bases cannot be
 completely excluded, and a repeat exam with increased inspiratory effort may
 be useful.
