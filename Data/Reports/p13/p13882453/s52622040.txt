                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-supine.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery. The lowermost sternal wire again shows dishiscences which are
 unchanged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A
 vague opacity obscuring the lingula is not very striking. The lung volumes are
 low, probably explaining crowding of lung markings at the lung bases. There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Vague a lingular opacity although not very striking. If pneumonia is a
 clinical concern short-term followup PA and later lateral radiographs may be
 helpful but findings are not highly convincing for pneumonia.
