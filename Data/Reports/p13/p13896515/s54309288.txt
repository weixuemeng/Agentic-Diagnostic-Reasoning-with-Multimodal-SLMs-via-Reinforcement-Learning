                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath and suspected congestive heart
 failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 multiple prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  The patient is after CABG.  Heart
 size and mediastinum are stable.  Diffuse interstitial opacities most likely
 correspond to chronic interstitial changes and unlikely to represent evidence
 of congestive heart failure.
 
 Questionable enlargement of the left hilus cannot be excluded.  Assessment of
 the patient with chest CT might be considered on a non-emergent basis.
