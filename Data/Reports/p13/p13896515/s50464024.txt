                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of ICD pacing device, with ICD lead in the right
 ventricle, additional leads overlying the expected location of the right
 atrium and a lead for biventricular pacing.  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 would be helpful to confirm appropriate lead positioning when the patient's
 condition allows.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and apparent asymmetrical pattern
 of pulmonary edema, left greater than right.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 is also demonstrated.  This may be reevaluated at the time of standard PA and
 lateral chest exam.
