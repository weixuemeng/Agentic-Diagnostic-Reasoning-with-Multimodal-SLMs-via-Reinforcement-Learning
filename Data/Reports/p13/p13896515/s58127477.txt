  1. Mild pulmonary edema.
  
  2. Opacities in the left upper lobe and right lung base, which could reflect
  atelectasis or focal edema, although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in
  the right clinical setting.
  
  3. Cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, sob  // Eval for volume status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to motion artifact. The lungs are well
 expanded. Indistinct vasculature and cardiomegaly suggests mild pulmonary
 edema, although some of the haziness could be due to technique. Hazy opacities
 are seen in the left upper lung and right lung base, which could reflect
 atelectasis or focal edema, although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in
 the right clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Opacities in the left upper lobe and right lung base, which could reflect
 atelectasis or focal edema, although cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in
 the right clinical setting.  Re-assessment after diuresis is recommended
 
 3. Cardiomegaly.
