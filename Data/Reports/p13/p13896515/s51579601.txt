 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a marked improvement the lung
 volumes have increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  The signs indicative
 of fluid overload have overall decreased.  A potentially pre-existing small
 left pleural effusion combined to an area of retrocardiac atelectasis has
 completely resolved.  The size and border of the cardiac silhouette can be
 better determined than previously.  No new opacities. Unchanged course and
 position of the pacemaker leads. The sternal wires are constant.
