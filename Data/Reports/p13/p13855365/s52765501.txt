  0.8 cm rounded opacity projecting over the posterior right ninth rib at the
  right lung base which is most likely artifactual, however, recommend oblique
  radiographs for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Syncope, head strike, left shoulder pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve replacement.  The
 lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm projecting over
 the posterior lung fields.  On the frontal view, there is mild blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, which could be due to a trace pleural effusion or
 pleural thickening.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  There is no focal
 consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  There is a 0.8 cm rounded opacity projecting over the posterior right
 ninth rib at the right lung base which is most likely artifactual, however,
 recommend oblique radiograph for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Suboptimal lateral view due to patient's arm overlying the posterior
 chest.  On the frontal view, there is blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle, may be due to a small pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
 
 2.  0.8 cm rounded opacity projecting over the posterior right ninth rib at
 the right lung base, however, recommend oblique radiographs for further
 evaluation.
