                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy
 and aortic valve replacement.  Previously noted right internal jugular central
 venous catheter has been removed.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette which is unchanged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  There are low lung
 volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity persists, and a small left pleural
 effusion likely remains.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting atelectasis
 though infection cannot be excluded.  Small left pleural effusion, relatively
 unchanged.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary
 edema.
