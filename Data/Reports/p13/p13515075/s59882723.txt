                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle accident now intubated.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new area of irregular, branching opacification in the right lower
 lobe, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration. The enteric tube and
 endotracheal tube are unchanged compared to the prior radiograph.  Low lung
 volumes along with the patient supine positioning likely account for apparent
 pulmonary vascular crowding.    No pleural abnormalities detected.  The heart
 and mediastinum are normal appearing.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New irregular opacification in the right lower lobe which may represent
 atelectasis, but for which follow up radiographs are recommended to evaluate
 for resolution or evolution.
