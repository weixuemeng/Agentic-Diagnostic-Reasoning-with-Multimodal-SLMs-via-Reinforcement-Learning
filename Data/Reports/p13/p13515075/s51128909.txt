                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.  Evaluate pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable radiograph of the chest.  Compared to prior
 radiograph, there has been interval extubation which could explain the
 bibasilar consolidations, which are also concerning for developing bilateral
 pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The trachea is mildly leftward
 deviated, which in a patient with recent neck surgeries, raises the concern
 for possible neck hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 1. Worsening bibasilar opacities which may represent
 post-extubation changes, or developing basilar pneumonia.
 
 2. Leftward tracheal deviation which raises the possibility of neck hematoma
 in a patient with recent cervical spine surgery.
 
 These findings were relayed to ___, at 340PM on the day of the
 examination.
