                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A veil-like radiopacity projecting over the right lung base on the frontal
 view is explained by a large mediastinal pleural fat collection better
 demonstrated on the lateral view ___.  Lungs are essentially clear,
 but possibly hyperinflated.  This raises the possibility of acute exacerbation
 of obstructive airways diseases, including asthma, but there is no evidence of
 pneumonia.  The heart size is normal, hilar, mediastinal silhouettes and
 pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
