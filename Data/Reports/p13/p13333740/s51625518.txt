                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with new onset of mental status changes. 
 Decreased breath sounds on the left.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest shows increased opacity
 identified at the left lung base and in the perihilar region with associated
 air bronchograms.  The right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is difficult to assess given adjacent consolidation in the lung. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower and potentially upper lobe regions of consolidation,
 which may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  PA and
 lateral may also help further assess.  Recommend repeat after treatment to
 document resolution.
