                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and reported history of aortic
 valve replacement.  Left internal jugular central venous catheter has been
 removed.  Heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  There are low lung volumes.  Dense retrocardiac and right
 patchy bibasilar opacities are similar, and may reflect atelectasis with small
 effusions, unchanged.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with
 probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax is seen although the lung apices are obscured by the patient's
 chin.  Bilateral humeral head prostheses are demonstrated.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes with anterior bridging osteophytes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior.  Persistent bibasilar opacities
 likely reflecting atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
