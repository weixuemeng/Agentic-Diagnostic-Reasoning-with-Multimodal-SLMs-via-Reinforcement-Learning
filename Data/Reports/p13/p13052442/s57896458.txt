                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, there is a continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with possible bilateral small effusions
 and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  As previously, the study is
 severely limited by scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. 
 Nevertheless, there is no gross evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.  Lateral view would be necessary to evaluate the region behind the
 heart.
