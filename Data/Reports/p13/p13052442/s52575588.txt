                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement who
 presents for evaluation of effusion/infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.  The technique
 was limited due to decreased cooperation from the patient regarding
 instructions for the exam and inability to raise the left arm for the lateral
 image. The study is also limited by body habitus.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
 The heart and mediastinum appear unchanged in appearance. The lung volumes are
 low. There appears to be persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral
 pleural effusions. The left lung base is difficult to evaluate given artifact
 from the body habitus. No definite pneumothorax is present. Median sternotomy
 wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  In the context of a limited study, no definite evidence of an
 infiltrate.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions. Left lung base is
 difficult to evaluate due to artifact from body habitus.
