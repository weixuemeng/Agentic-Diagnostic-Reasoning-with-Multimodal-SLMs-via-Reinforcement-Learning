                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and
 mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable
 without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  10 mm nodular opacity is
 seen projecting over the right upper lobe not clearly seen on the previous
 exam.  Lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal
 consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly evident. 
 Dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine with associated degenerative
 changes are noted. Spiral tacks are seen in the left abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 10 mm nodular
 opacity projecting over the right upper lobe appears new and can be further
 assessed with a nonemergent chest CT if clinically indicated.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 
 Nonemergent chest CT can be obtained if clinically indicated.
