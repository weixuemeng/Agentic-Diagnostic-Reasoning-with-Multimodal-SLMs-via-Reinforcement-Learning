                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis from hepatobiliary source, with pulmonary edema and
 asymmetric opacification of the right upper lobe seen over the past ___ days.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiograph from ___, and a series of
 prior radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 BEDSIDE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are now lower.  There is
 persistent mild pulmonary edema which is unchanged from ___, but shows
 considerable improvement from ___.  Linear opacities over the lower
 lobes as well as obscuration of the diaphragmatic contours indicate persistent
 bibasilar atelectasis and left greater than right small effusion.  Once again,
 asymmetric heterogeneous opacities, at times with a nodular pattern, are seen
 in the right upper lobe, raising concern for an infectious process.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Asymmetric nodular opacification of the right upper lobe raises concern
 for a disseminated infectious process, given the patient's history of sepsis. 
 If there is such a clinical concern, CT of the chest would facilitate
 diagnosis. 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved from ___ but remains unchanged
 from yesterday.  
 3.  Persistent, left greater than right small pleural effusions as well as
 bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 
 
 NOTE:  Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 11:05 a.m.
