                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Bandemia and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___ and CT of the abdomen from
 earlier on the same day.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. 
 There is a similar infrahilar opacification suggesting atelectasis or
 scarring.  More generally there is increased bibasilar opacification, but
 streaky and band-like in morphology, mostly suggestive of atelectasis or
 scarring with a suspected small left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacification, increased but non-specific.  Pneumonia
 is a consideration but the appearance could be compatible with atelectasis. 
 Correlation with a CT performed earlier on the same day is also more
 concordant with a noninfectious explanation, however.
