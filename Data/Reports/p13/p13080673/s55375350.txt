                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Sepsis,   ascending cholangitis, increase in
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval progression of right
 perihilar and lower lobe opacity that although might potentially represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, can also reflect progressing infectious process. 
 Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged.  Right internal jugular line tip
 is slightly more medial than expected, correlation with this line functioning
 is required to exclude the possibility of the tip being outside of the SVC or
 any other venous structure.
