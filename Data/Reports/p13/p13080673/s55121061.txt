                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary edema and asymmetry on last chest
 x-ray.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral radiographs were obtained.  Pulmonary edema has decreased with
 persistent asymmetric opacification in the right upper lobe.  While this may
 be continuing to resolve asymmetric edema, a developing infectious process in
 this area would be difficult to exclude.  Bibasilar left greater than right
 effusions and atelectasis are also noted.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema with persistent asymmetric right upper
 lobe opacification perhaps reflecting resolving asymmetric edema, though
 developing infection remains possible and continued close clinical attention
 is recommended.
