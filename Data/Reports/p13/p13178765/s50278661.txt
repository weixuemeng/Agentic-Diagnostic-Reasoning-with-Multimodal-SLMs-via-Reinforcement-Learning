                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, asymmetric lung sounds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Cardiac silhouette size remains mild to moderately
 enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded.  The mediastinal contours are similar.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings with mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal
 consolidation.  There is likely a small left pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes demonstrated in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, probable trace left pleural effusion and
