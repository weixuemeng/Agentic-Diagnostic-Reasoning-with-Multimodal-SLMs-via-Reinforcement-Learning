 The endotracheal tube terminates 1.4 cm above the level of the carina,
 approaching the orifice of the right mainstem bronchus, and the enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  There is slight elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Diffuse alveolar airspace opacities are noted, most pronounced
 in a perihilar pattern, right greater the left, concerning for severe
 pulmonary edema.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged in size given the AP technique.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.
 No pneumothorax is detected.  Right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
 field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Severe pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
