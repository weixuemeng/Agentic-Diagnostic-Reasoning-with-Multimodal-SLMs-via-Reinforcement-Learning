                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Unexplained leukocytosis with recent upper respiratory infection.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there appears to be minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No focal consolidation is seen.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is likely due to overlying soft tissue.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. 
 The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively low lung volumes with possible minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
