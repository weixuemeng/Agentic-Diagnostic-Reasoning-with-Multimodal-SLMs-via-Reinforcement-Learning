 HISTORY:  Hypoxia to ___%.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET- CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Ill-defined patchy opacity within the right lower lobe
 is concerning for pneumonia.  Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. 
 Scarring within the lung apices is re- demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs are recommended after
 treatment to ensure resolution of this finding.
