                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cough and dyspnea and altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There are diffusely increased
 pulmonary markings with more focal opacity at the left base and right apex,
 which are new from ___ and may represent infection on a background of
 mild pulmonary edema. There are probably small pleural effusions. Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable allowing for lung volumes.  The left
 pectoral pacemaker leads end in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Median
 sternotomy wires are intact.  A prosthetic aortic valve is again seen.  A
 calcified granuloma is again seen in the right lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. Opacity in the left base and right apex may
 represent infection on a background of mild pulmonary edema. Recommend repeat
 radiograph after treatment, with improved inspiration, to document resolution.
