                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with prior chest radiograph, there is significant interval
 worsening of the left sided pleural effusion with associated moderate to
 severe atelectasis.  The aerated left lung is otherwise unremarkable.  No
 focal opacities are seen in the right lung.  Blunting of the right pleural
 sulcus is compatible with a small right-sided pleural effusion which is
 slightly improved from ___.  The right hilus is unremarkable.  The
 left hilus and left heart border are obscured by the large opacity in the left
 hemithorax.  Sternotomy wires appear intact.  Surgical clips in the right
 upper quadrant may be from prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Significant interval worsening of left sided pleural effusion with
 concurrent moderate to severe atelectasis.
 
 2.  No focal parenchymal opacities in the aerated lungs to suggest pneumonia.
 
 3.  Interval improvement of small right-sided pleural effusion.
