                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male preop. Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam

 the lung apices.  Lungs are otherwise notable for hyperinflation, but they are
 clear of consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Syndesmophytes seen in the spine, similar to prior.  Deformity of right
 clavicle compatible with prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
