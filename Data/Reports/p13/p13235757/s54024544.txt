                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, here to evaluate ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to rotation of the patient.  Within this
 limitation, the ET tube tip terminates 2 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and coiling within the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen, likely within the gastric fundus.  There is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 exaggerated due to low lung volumes and patient rotation.  Opacification at
 the bilateral lung bases most likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube tip 2 cm above the carina.
