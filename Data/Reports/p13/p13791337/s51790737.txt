                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Mild pulmonary edema is relatively unchanged compared to the prior
 study. Unchanged enlargement of the hila bilaterally is suggestive of
 pulmonary artery hypertension.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small to
 moderate in degree, and may be slightly increased on the right compared to the
 prior study.  The left pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis.  Old
 bilateral rib fractures are noted.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild congestive heart failure with small to moderate size bilateral pleural
 effusions, which may be slightly increased on the right.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
