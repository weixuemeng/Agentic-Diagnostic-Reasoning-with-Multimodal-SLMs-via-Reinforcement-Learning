                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Oxygen saturations in the low 80s and absent breath sounds on
 physical exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is
 rotated to the right. The lung volumes are low. There has been interval
 increase in right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis and possible
 partial collapse of the right lower lobe. Left base opacity with likely
 pleural effusion persists.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is partially obscured by overlying opacification caused by the
 pleural effusion and patient rotation. Possible minimal inferior subluxation
 of the left humeral head may be positional.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Patient rotated to the right and low lung volumes make the exam slightly
 suboptimal.  
 2.  Interval increase in right sided pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Persistent left base opacity, likely pleural effusion.
