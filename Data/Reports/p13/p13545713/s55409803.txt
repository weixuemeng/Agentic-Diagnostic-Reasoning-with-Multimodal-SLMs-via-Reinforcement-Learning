                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased haziness at
 the bases with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms.  This is consistent with
 bilateral layering pleural effusions.  It is difficult to determine whether
 the effusions have increased or whether the apparent increase is related to
 difference patient position.
 
 There are compressive atelectatic changes at the bases in this patient with
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Some element of elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure is present.
