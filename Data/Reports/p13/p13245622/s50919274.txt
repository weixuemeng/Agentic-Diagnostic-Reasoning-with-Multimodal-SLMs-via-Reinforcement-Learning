                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, ___ AT 9:14 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with decompensated cirrhosis, worsening
 shortness of breath and wheezing, question left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:27.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained on ___ at 9:14 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There is persisting consolidation in the left lung base with associated
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and evidence of pleural effusion on the
 lateral projection.  These findings combined would favor partial lower lobe
 collapse in the setting of an effusion rather than an acute pneumonia,
 although given the focality, an infectious process should also be considered. 
 Lung volumes are somewhat diminished and there is crowding of the vasculature
 with evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 Overall heart is stably enlarged.  No pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes
 in the thoracolumbar spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
