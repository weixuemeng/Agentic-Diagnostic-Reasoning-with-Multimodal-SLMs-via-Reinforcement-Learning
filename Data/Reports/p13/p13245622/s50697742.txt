                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of moderate aortic stenosis and
 cirrhosis, now with probable left lower lobe pneumonia.  Assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There are new diffuse alveolar opacities,
 most severe in the mid-to-lower lungs, right greater than left, which is
 concerning for new moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  Relative increased
 density within the right lung apex is concerning for a concurrent new
 pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may continue to reflect
 pneumonia and/or atelectasis.  A moderate left pleural effusion appears
 increased and is now large.  Small right pleural effusion is likely. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are obscured by diffuse edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema 
 2.  Right apical consolidation is concerning for new pneumonia
