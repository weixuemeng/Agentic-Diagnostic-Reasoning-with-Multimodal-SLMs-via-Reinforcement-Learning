                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF< worsening dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Mild perihilar haziness, more so on the right, suggests
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There are likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is again noted.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.
