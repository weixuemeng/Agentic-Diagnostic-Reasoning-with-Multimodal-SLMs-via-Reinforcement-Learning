                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib pain after fall, rule out fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS CHEST: There are increased interstitial markings at the
 bases.  There is no consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and pulmonary structures are unremarkable.  Heart size is
 normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Increased bibasilar
 interstitial markings likely from chronic lung disease but these can be better
 characterized on a non-emergent high resolution chest CT.
