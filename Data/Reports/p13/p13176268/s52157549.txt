                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with post-op hypoxia  // ?atelectasis vs PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, new opacification in
 the left mid and lower lung could represent aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Increasing retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis,
 though aspiration cannot be excluded.  The heart is moderately enlarged,
 increased from prior.  No appreciable pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 Platelike atelectasis in the right mid-to-lower lung persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacification in the left mid to lower lung could represent aspiration,
 though asymmetric pulmonary edema is possible, given new moderate
 cardiomegaly.
 2. Increasing retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis secondary to
 mucous plugging, though aspiration cannot be definitively excluded.
 3. Persistent platelike atelectasis in the right mid to lower lung.
