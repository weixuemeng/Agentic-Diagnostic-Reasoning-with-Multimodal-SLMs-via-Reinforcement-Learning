  Compared to the study earlier this morning monitoring and support devices are
  in stable position. Lung volumes are low, however atelectasis in the right mid
  lung is improved. Hazy opacities at the lung bases are less conspicuous
  although persistent at least on the right. Heart size is normal. There is no
  pneumothorax. There may be a small right pleural effusion.
