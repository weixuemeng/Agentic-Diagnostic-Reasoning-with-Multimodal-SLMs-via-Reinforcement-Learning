  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis slightly progressed
  from the prior study but similar to the exam from ___ at ___ 20. Left base
  appears slightly better aerated.  No new focal consolidation.  No
  pneumothorax.  Stable positioning of support devices.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p bronch  // s/p bronch
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior studies dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian large bore catheter, left subclavian central line, and
 endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube courses below
 the diaphragm with the tip not definitively identified.  Layering right
 effusion with associated patchy airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis.  There is improved aeration at the left base and the left pleural
 effusion appears to be somewhat smaller, although this could just reflect
 differences in positioning.  No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given patient
 rotation on the current study.
