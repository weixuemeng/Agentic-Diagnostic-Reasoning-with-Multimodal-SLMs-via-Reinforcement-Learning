 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVC s/p trach and peg, ?aspiration event  //
 look for evidence of aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.
 
 A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. A left subclavian central venous
 catheter terminates at the lower SVC. The lung volumes are low. The heart size
 is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 central pulmonary vessels are engorged, however, there is no overt edema.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 There is a new focal opacity within the right upper zone which may reflect
 aspiration or small consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right upper zone opacity which may reflect suspected aspiration, versus
 early consolidation.
