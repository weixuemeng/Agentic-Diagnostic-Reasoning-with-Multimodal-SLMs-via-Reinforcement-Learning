                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML with leukemic infiltrates, assess for improvement, airspace
 disease.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 6:33 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric or NG type tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm,
 off film.  Multiple leads and other structures overlie the chest.  A PICC line
 is present, tip not optimally demonstrated, but in the region of the SVC/RA
 junction.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged.  There is patchy opacity throughout both lungs with slightly
 increased retrocardiac density.  Allowing for technical differences, the
 overall appearance is quite similar to prior study, with only subtle
 differences in the distribution of the parenchymal opacities. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 2.  Patchy opacities throughout both lungs.  While this could represent
 atypical distribution of CHF, the differential diagnosis includes other
 etiologies for patchy pulmonary opacity.  No gross right effusion.
 3.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, unchanged.
