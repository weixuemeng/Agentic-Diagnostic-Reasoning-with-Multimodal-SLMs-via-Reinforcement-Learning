                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube remains appropriately positioned, ending 4.4
 cm above the level of the carina.  There are two enteric catheters, one of
 which ends within the lower esophagus (an esophageal balloon per the coverage
 physician's report) and the other of which passes below the level of the
 diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly.  A left-sided subclavian
 central venous catheter ends near the superior cavoatrial junction, unchanged.
 Dense left retrocardiac opacification is likely atelectasis, unchanged. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has essentially resolved.  Patchy opacities in both
 lower lungs persist.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal contours
 are normal.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Improvement in opacities most suggestive of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Dense retrocardiac opacification, not entiredly specific but typical for
 atelectasis.  
 
 3.  Persistent scattered bilateral lower lung opacities, which may represent
 residua of recent infection.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:12
 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study, 10 minutes after discovery.
