                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukemia infiltrating into lungs,
 intubated, on chemo, considering extubation.  // Evaluate progression of
 intrapulmonary process. Eval tube and line placement
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 After transient clearing on ___, lung volumes are lower and there is
 greater generalized pulmonary opacification.  First consideration should be
 pulmonary edema perhaps related to volume administration since the heart,
 pulmonary vessels and mediastinal veins are larger today. ET tube and upper
 enteric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively.  A right-sided
 central venous catheter ends in the right atrium as before. Pleural effusions
 are presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax
