 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:04 PM
  Tracheostomy tube terminating approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. Interval
  removal of the OG tube. Right parenchymal opacities are similar, and remain
  concerning for an infectious process or aspiration. Left lung also appears
  similar.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with coughing  // assess for change in ET tube-
 if sitting on carina      assess for change in ET tube- if sitting on carina
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are unchanged airspace opacities throughout the right lung and involving
 the left mid and lower lung with relative sparing of the left upper lobe.
 These findings could reflect an atypical appearance of pulmonary edema but are
 more concerning for pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised. The right
 internal jugular dual-lumen catheter and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in
 position. There has been interval removal of a nasogastric tube.  There are
 likely small layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 patient rotation between studies.
