  Sequential chest radiographs demonstrate a new nasogastric feeding tube
  initially terminating distal left segmental bronchi and subsequently in
  appropriate position in the stomach. Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are
  similar to prior. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NG placement  // confirm NG
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, 2 images are now provided. First image
 shows malposition of the feeding tube in the left bronchial system, the second
 image shows correct position of the feeding tube in the middle parts of the
 stomach. The tracheostomy tube and the right hemodialysis catheter are in
 correct position.  The widespread airspace opacities are unchanged in extent
 and severity.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
