  1. Right triple lumen tunneled central venous catheter was seen to terminate
  in the right atrium on the fluoroscopic spot radiographs of ___. 
  Today the tip appears higher projecting near the right bronchus with a
  somewhat medial course potentially in the azygos vein.  Consider repeat
  radiograph with AP and lateral if possible to confirm position in the SVC.  
  
  2. Lung volumes remain very low with bilateral atelectasis.  Previous
  multifocal opacities appear to be improving.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
  
  
  
  The findings were telephoned to Dr. [___] by ___ at [19:00],
