 aspiration
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  6:18 am
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in positioning and
 technique, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen are patchy
 opacities, relatively diffusely throughout both lungs, more pronounced on the
 right side. Tracheostomy tube, nasoenteric tube, and right IJ line are grossly
 unchanged. Possible minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle. No left
 pleural effusion identify ..
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change.
