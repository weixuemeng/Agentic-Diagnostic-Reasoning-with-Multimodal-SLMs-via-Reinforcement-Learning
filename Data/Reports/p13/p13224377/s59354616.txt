                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Confirmation of tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:58 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph is compared to the previous image.  In unchanged
 manner, the endotracheal tube is located too high.  A telephone conversation
 on this topic was performed with the referring physician earlier today.  The
 tube needs to be repositioned.  The remaining appearance of the lung
 parenchyma, with fluid overload, cardiomegaly, atelectasis and without
 pneumothorax is unchanged.
