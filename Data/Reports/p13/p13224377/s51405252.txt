                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with AML status post cycle 1 with suspected
 pneumonia, increasing shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 6:20
 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film on ___ at 11:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip terminating in the proximal
 SVC.  There continues to be bibasilar airspace opacities which appear slightly
 worse on the left but essentially unchanged on the right.  These findings are
 suggestive of pneumonia, much less likely an atypical presentation of
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  Possible layering left effusion.
