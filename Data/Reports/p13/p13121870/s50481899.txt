                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with copious secretions, trach and PEG placed
 today.  // Comparison to previous, ETT out, trach and PEG in.      Comparison
 to previous, ETT out, trach and PEG in.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Air collection in the right diaphragmatic region could be either an anterior
 basal pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum.  However, since the patient has had
 recent PEG, it is probably air in the abdomen.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard position and there is no pneumo mediastinum or pleural air in the
 upper chest.
 Severe left lower lobe atelectasis, milder right lower lobe atelectasis, and
 small to moderate, bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Heart is normal
 size, but leftward mediastinal shift reflects volume loss in the left chest.
 Left PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
