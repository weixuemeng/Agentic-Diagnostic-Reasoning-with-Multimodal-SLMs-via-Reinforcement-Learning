                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and right anterior pleuritic chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Within the limitations of this study
 technique, there is no evidence of rib fracture demonstrated.
 
 There is questionable fullness of the left hilum, although it might reflect
 only superposition of the vascular structures.  Evaluation of the patient with
 anterior shallow obliques is suggested.
 
 Note is made that there is also decrease anterior retrosternal space. 
 Although this might be a constitutional abnormality, dilated ascending aorta
 or anterior mediastinal mass would be a reasonable possibility.  Correlation
 with chest CT might be considered. 
 
 Given two potential abnormalities present, they might be evaluated with
 decreased dose chest CT tailored to answer those two questions of left hilus
 and ascending aorta/anterior mediastinum
