                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with A-FIB with RVR, soret hroat, cough
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A subtle nodular opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung corresponds with a right lower lobe
 nodule on prior CT.  Otherwise lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No signs of pneumonia.
 2. Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung compatible with
 a nodule seen on prior CT.  If patient has elevated risk factors for
 malignancy, consider nonemergent CT chest to further assess.
