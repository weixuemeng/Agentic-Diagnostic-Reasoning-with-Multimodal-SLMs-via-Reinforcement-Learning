                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate previously seen fullness in the left hilum and possible
 dilated ascending aorta.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Oblique images of the chest show that the previously seen fullness
 in the left hilum was likely due to superimposition of normal vascular
 structures.  The abnormal mediastinal contour persists and most likely
 represents a tortuous aorta.  Lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tortuous ascending aorta with or without a component of dilation. Consider
 CT scan for further evaluation if warranted clinically.
 2.  Previously seen left hilar fullness is likely due to superimposition of
 vascular structures.
