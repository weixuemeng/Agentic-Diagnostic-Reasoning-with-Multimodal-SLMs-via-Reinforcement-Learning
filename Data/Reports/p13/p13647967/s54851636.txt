                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diastolic heart failure and pleural
 effusion with prior thoracentesis  // ?progression of pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Decreased size of right pleural
 effusion with residual blunting of lateral costophrenic sulcus and apparent
 elevation of right hemidiaphragm compared to baseline radiograph of ___. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased right pleural effusion.  Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm
 may reflect a subpulmonic component of the effusion.  Additional right lateral
 decubitus radiograph may be considered to more accurately quantify the pleural
 effusion if warranted clinically.
