                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously seen layering right pleural effusion has increased, now large
 and causing adjacent compressive atelectasis and mild leftward midline shift. 
 There may be a small left pleural effusion, incompletely evaluated on this
 single AP radiograph.  The mediastinal contour is difficult to evaluate due to
 effusion, but is likely stable.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 pulmonary edema are present.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Interval increase in large right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis and mild leftward shift of midline structures.
