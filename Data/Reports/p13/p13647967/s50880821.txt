                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right pleural effusion s/o chest tube
 placement  // evaluate for PTX, tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, the right chest tube has been placed.  However, the
 tip overlies the lateral right chest wall at the level of the right mid chest,
 in the region of the right sixth and seventh ribs.  It does not appear to
 extend beyond the chest wall into the pleural space.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Again seen is opacity at the right lung base with obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm, slightly improved.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
 diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  This is also probably
 slightly improved.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base, slightly
 improved.  No left-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right-sided chest tube does not appear to cross the chest wall.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 2. Right base opacity is slightly improved.  CHF findings and left base
 atelectasis also slightly improved.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Positioning of the right chest tube discussed by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ ___ at ___:16 on ___.  By report, the chest tube did
 successfully drain some fluid, which might account for improvement at the
 right lung base, question interval retraction.
