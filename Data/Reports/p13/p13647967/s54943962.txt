                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous line. Lung volumes
 have diminished with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and interval
 improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion. Bilateral layering effusions
 with associated airspace opacities likely reflecting partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Layering bilateral effusions with associated airspace disease most consistent
 with partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.
