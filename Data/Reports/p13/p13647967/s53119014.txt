                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with low o2 sats  // Eval for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New hilar and perihilar opacities with a small right pleural effusion are
 consistent with pulmonary edema. Two round opacities in the peripheral mid and
 lower left lung may also reflect pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection
 is not excluded.  Bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation is also present,
 given obscuration of both hemidiaphragms. The size of cardiac silhouette is
 difficult to assess given the prominent perihilar opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema with small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
 Superimposed infection is not excluded.
