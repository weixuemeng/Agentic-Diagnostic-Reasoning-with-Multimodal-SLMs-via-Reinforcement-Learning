 There is increased vascular congestion with associated patchy airspace disease
 more on the right than the left. Findings most likely reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema given the rapidity of appearance, although an infectious
 process should also be considered. Followup imaging would be recommended. No
 pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
