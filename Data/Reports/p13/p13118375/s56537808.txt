                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p R SFA stent and toe amputation with pulmonary
 edema/congestion, worsening postop. Pt has worsening respiratory status with
 fever. Pt is in PACU.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, there has been interval decrease in the
 right lower lobe vascular congestion. Vascular congestion is actually more
 increased on the left on the current study. There is continued opacity in the
 right upper lobe, which is now more coalescent, suggesting pneumonia. No
 pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  More coalescent right upper lobe opacity, in the setting of improved right
 lower lobe vascular congestion/edema, suggests right upper lobe pneumonia.
