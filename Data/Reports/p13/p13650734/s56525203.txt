                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath and cough,
 chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 Similar, as seen on previous examination, there is a degree of irregular
 peripheral vascular distribution in the lungs coinciding with low positioned
 and flattened diaphragms, all indicative of COPD.  Acute parenchymal
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  On previous examination identified plate
 atelectasis in the left base coinciding with some small amount of pleural
 effusion in the left-sided and posterior pleural sinus has disappeared.  Thus,
 there is presently no evidence of acute pneumonic infiltrates in this patient
 with otherwise rather typical and advanced findings consistent with COPD.  No
 pneumothorax is present in the apical area.
