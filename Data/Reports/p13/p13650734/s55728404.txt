 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and relative paucity of
 the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with emphysema. 
 Scarring within the right apex is unchanged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Emphysema.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
