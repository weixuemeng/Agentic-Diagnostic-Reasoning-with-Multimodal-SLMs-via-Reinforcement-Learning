                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lung cancer, feeling weak, rule out infectious
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart size remains top
 normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged with prominence of the pulmonary
 arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension, better
 assessed on the recent CT.  Left basilar opacification likely reflecting
 combination of the patient's known necrotic left lower lobe mass and small
 left pleural effusion is relatively similar compared to the previous
 radiograph.  No new focal consolidation is present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Multiple clips are demonstrated within the medial aspect of the imaged left
 upper extremity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change from the previous radiograph.  Continued left
 basilar opacification reflective of the patient's known necrotic left lower
 lobe mass and small left pleural effusion.
