 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there E again is opacification at
 the left base consistent with the known left lower lobe mass seen on CT an
 adjacent small pleural effusion.  Biapical pleural changes again are
 consistent with old healed tuberculous disease.
 There is suggestion of an ill defined area of increased opacification in the
 right mid zone as well as just above the left lower lung mass.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, either these could represent a developing
 pneumonia.
