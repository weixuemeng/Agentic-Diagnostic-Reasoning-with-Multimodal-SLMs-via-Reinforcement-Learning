                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 13:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dementia, hypertension, unwitnessed
 fall, widened mediastinum on portable film, please evaluate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at 13:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heart is within normal limits of size.  Given patient rotation, the
 mediastinum is likely within normal limits.  The aorta is quite unfolded and
 tortuous on the current examination, but this is felt to be related to patient
 positioning.  Lungs appear grossly clear.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary
 edema or pneumothorax.  Bones are osteopenic and there is a mild wedging of
 several of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae, the chronicity of
 which is difficult to ascertain.  In addition, on the frontal projection,
 there is an unusual appearance to the left humeral head and neck, suggesting
 possible remote trauma with fracture, though this could be related to the
 position of the patient's arm.  No acute bony abnormality is appreciated. 
 Narrowing of the right acromiohumeral distance suggest a chronic rotator cuff
 tear.
