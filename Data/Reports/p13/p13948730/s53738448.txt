                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest compressions.  Evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  No definite rib fractures are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  No definite rib fractures identified.  If there is persistent concern for
 rib fracture, a dedicated rib series is more sensitive.
