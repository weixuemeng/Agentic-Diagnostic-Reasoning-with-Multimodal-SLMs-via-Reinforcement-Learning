  Mild pulmonary edema. An opacity at the right lung base in the appropriate
  clinical setting could represent pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall  // Pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widespread interstitial and airway abnormalities suggests the possibility of
 chronic lung disease, difficult to assess in the absence of older radiographs.
 Superimposed on this process is pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 interstitial edema.  Additionally, more focal opacities are present in the
 right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure and in the right middle lobe,
 partially obscuring the right heart border.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged, and note is made of tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema superimposed on likely
 chronic interstitial lung airways disease.  Superimposed pneumonia in the
 right upper and right middle lobes are not excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Direct comparison to outside chest radiographs would be
 helpful to better assess chronicity.  Short-term followup radiographs in ___
 weeks after treatment for acute lung disease is suggested to assess for
 improvement and to the determine chronicity of lung findings.  High-resolution
 chest CT may also be considered at that time if warranted clinically.
