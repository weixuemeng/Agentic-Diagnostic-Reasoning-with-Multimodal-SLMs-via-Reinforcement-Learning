                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent trauma, here to evaluate for
 traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show persistent low
 lung volumes without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size but stable.  Left hilar densities are unchanged from the
 preceding radiograph and likely represent calcified lymph nodes.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A surgical clip anterolateral to
 the right hilum is stable.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified;
 however, the lower lateral ribs are excluded from view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No cardiopulmonary finding to suggest trauma.
