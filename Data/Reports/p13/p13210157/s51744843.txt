                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation, overdose.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates approximately 2.8 cm above the carina.  There is
 a right-sided IJ which terminates in the low SVC.  An NG tube extends below
 the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach.  Opacity in the right
 lower lobe may be secondary to atelectasis vs. effusion.  The heart size is
 normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours aside from mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lines and tubes in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Opacity in the right lower lobe may be secondary to a small pleural
 effusion or atelectasis.
