                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dobhoff placement  // eval for dobhoff
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Two views of the chest show the sequential repositioning of the feeding tube,
 with the wire stylet in place, from the mid esophagus to the upper stomach on
 the most recent image.  Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pulmonary edema. Healed
 fractures of the post for lateral right middle ribs account for local pleural
 thickening.
 
 The course and termination of to trans subclavian pacer leads would be more
 reliably determined with a concurrent lateral view. 2 remnant epicardial leads
 are also noted.
 
 Shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen, probably
 terminating ultimately in the right upper quadrant, but not traceable
 continuously.
