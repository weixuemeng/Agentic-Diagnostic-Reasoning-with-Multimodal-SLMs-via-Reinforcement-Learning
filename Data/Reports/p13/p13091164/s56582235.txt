                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Assess for acute cardiac or pulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  There is linear left mid-to-lower lung atelectasis
 as well as left retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded on the basis of
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles, seen on the lateral projection.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild left mid-to-lower lung atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.
 
 2. Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.
