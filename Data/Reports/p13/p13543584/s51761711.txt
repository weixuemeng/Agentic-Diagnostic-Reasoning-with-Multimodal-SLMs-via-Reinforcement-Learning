                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe asthma and asthma exacerbation
 despite oral steroids  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal. 19 mm wide target like opacity projects over the left
 upper lobe at the level of the second anterior interspace. I see no
 corresponding abnormality on the lateral view and, a similar size, less well
 defined opacity projects over the right chest in a comparable location, so I
 suspect both may be external clothing artifacts.  For that reason a repeat
 frontal chest radiograph should be taken with the patient disrobed to the
 waist in order to exclude small foci of infection in the lungs.  Lungs are
 otherwise clear and there is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement.
