                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation and CHF, on amiodarone,
 with increasing shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged since ___.  Compared to ___, previous pulmonary vascular congestion has improved.  Nevertheless,
 there is region of heterogeneously increased radiodensity in the right mid
 lung, extending from the hilus to the lateral chest wall and a smaller region
 on the left.  It is possible these are small areas of amiodarone toxicity. 
 Unfortunately, that condition does not have diagnostically specific
 morphology, and is a diagnosis of exclusion after other conditions are
 considered.  The patient does not have pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural
 effusion, and there is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement. 
 Thoracic aorta is extremely tortuous and mildly enlarged throughout but
 unchanged for many years.
