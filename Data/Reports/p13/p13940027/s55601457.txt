                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, acute exacerbation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased
 retrosternal clear space compatible with COPD.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly appears to be chronic, and likely relates to pleural
 thickening.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 are is no focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  Old
 right-sided rib fractures are again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 COPD.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
