                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation and acute shortness of breath.  Evaluate for an
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, the lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Coarsened interstitial markings are chronic, likely related to
 COPD.  There is no focal airspace opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable changes of COPD.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
