                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral lower extremity swelling.  History of coronary disease and
 congestive failure.  Question pulmonary edema.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again enlarged but unchanged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are more generally unchanged.  Fissures are
 minimally thickened, but there is no clear indication for parenchymal edema. 
 Slight opacity along the lower right lateral lung appears unchanged, probably
 due to minor scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 patient is status post placement of a stent graft along the abdominal aorta,
 incompletely imaged. 
   
 IMPRESSION:  Mild thickening of fissures, suggesting slight fluid overload,
 but no parenchymal edema or convincing evidence for acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
