                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of small bowel obstruction.  Please evaluate NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to the prior
 exam.  Fissures are minimally thickened; however, there is no clear evidence
 of pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia are
 identified; however, there is mild left basilar atelectasis.  Enteric tube
 extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach. 
 Partially seen is placement of a stent graft along the abdominal aorta.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the
 stomach.
 
 2.  Mild left basilar opacities likely secondary to atelectasis; however, a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
