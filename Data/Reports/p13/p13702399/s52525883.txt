                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing creatinine. Evaluate for worsening edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present. The tip is
 difficult to visualize, though appears to be in the low SVC. Since the prior
 exam, the lung volumes are lower.  Mild pulmonary edema seems similar allowing
 for the changes in the lung volumes.  There is no new opacity, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size
 is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.
