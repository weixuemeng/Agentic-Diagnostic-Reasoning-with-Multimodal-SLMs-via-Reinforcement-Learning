                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with history of aortic stenosis status post
 repair, here with dyspnea orthopnea and hemoptysis, evaluate for CHF or
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are again
 identified. Allowing for changes due to technique and patient rotation, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, consistent with mild cardiomegaly.
 The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Diffuse interstitial prominence
 bilaterally is consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  A right basilar parenchymal opacity is
 consistent with compressive atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent right basilar atelectasis.
