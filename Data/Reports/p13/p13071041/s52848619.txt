 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Supine position exaggerates low lung volumes and moderate cardiomegaly.  Small
 pleural effusions layer posteriorly.  Mediastinum is not widened.  ET tube is
 in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and
 would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction. There is no obvious pneumothorax, but anterior
 pleural air is difficult to detect in the supine chest.
