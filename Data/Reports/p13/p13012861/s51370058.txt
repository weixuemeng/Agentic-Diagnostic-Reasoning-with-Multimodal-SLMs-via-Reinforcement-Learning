                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough after surgery, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable upright AP chest radiograph shows a large right pleural
 effusion obscuring the right lung base with what appears to be loculation
 medially.  This, as well as hazy opacity in the left mid lung are not
 significantly different compared to yesterday's study, but appear increased
 compared to ___.  The side hole of the patient's nasogastric tube is just
 above the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced.  Some
 radiodense contrast persists in the colon, probably from abdominal CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant radiographic change compared to yesterday's study.
 Recommend advancement of nasogastric tube approximately 7-8 cm as the current
 position has side hole just above the gastroesophageal junction.
