 AP CHEST, 1:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lung,
 abdomen, and spine.  Patient has post-obstructive pneumonia.  Reintubated due

 ET tube is in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube ends at the
 gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the
 side ports into the stomach.  Right lung is fully airless, a combination of
 new upper lobe collapse and previous atelectasis due to right pleural effusion
 and replacement by right lung and lower lobe mass.  Large mass in the left
 lung is unchanged.  There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 heart borders are entirely obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. 
 No pneumothorax.
