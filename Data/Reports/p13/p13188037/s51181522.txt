                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Spastic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is seen extending to the region of the low SVC.  There is mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is thickening of the minor
 fissure; however, trace amount of fluid within is not excluded.  Left base
 scarring/atelectasis is again seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Opacity
 projecting over the right mid lung most likely relates to costochondral
 calcification and vascular structures, although a consolidation is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous with mild prominence of the ascending aorta, similar as compared to
 chest CT from ___.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.
