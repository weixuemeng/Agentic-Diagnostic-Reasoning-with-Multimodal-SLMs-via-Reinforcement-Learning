                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patchy area of opacification
 in the left mid to lower lung zone is no longer present, most likely
 reflecting clearing of pneumonia.  Central catheter tip again extends to the
 mid portion of the SVC.  Abnormal distal right clavicle again noted.
