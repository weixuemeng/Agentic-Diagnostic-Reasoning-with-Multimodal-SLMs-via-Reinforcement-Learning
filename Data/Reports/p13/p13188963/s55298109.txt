                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with known nocardia pneumonia presents with new
 fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dense mitral annular
 calcifications are re- demonstrated.  Mild cardiomegaly is again noted,
 unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is minimally engorged.  Linear opacity within the right upper lobe
 with right lateral pleural thickening is similar to the previous study. 
 Moderate right pleural effusion appears somewhat increased in size compared to
 the previous study with worsening right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection however is not completely excluded.  Left lung is clear without
 focal consolidation.  Trace left pleural effusion is without change.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Slight interval increase in size of moderate right pleural effusion with
 worsening right basilar opacification likely reflective of compressive
 atelectasis.  Infection however is not excluded.
 2. Linear opacity in the right upper lung field with adjacent pleural
 thickening is likely the residua of previous pneumonia and is without
 substantial interval change.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 4. Unchanged trace left pleural effusion.
