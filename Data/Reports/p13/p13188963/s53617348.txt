                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with nocardia pneumonia and pleural effusions  //
 follow up of pleural effusion      follow up of pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous consolidation in the right upper lobe has substantially cleared, the
 adjacent pleura still thickened.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion
 remains.  Left lung is clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic, with
 particular left atrial enlargement that may be due to the heavily calcified
 mitral annulus.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild and there is no edema.
 
 Sternal wires are intact and aligned although there is separation of at least
 the uppermost sternal fragments, probably due to chronic nonunion.
