                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Dense mitral annular
 calcifications are re- demonstrated.  Cardiac silhouette size is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Lung
 volumes are low.  As seen previously, there is residual patchy opacity in the
 right mid lung field with adjacent focal right lateral pleural thickening,
 likely the residua of prior pneumonia.  There is a moderate size right pleural
 effusion, not substantially changed in the interval, with adjacent
 atelectasis.  Left lung remains clear.  There is likely a trace left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study.  Continued residual
 patchy opacity in the right mid lung field with adjacent focal pleural
 thickening, likely the residua of previous pneumonia.  Moderate size right
 pleural effusion is similar with perhaps a possible trace left pleural
 effusion.
