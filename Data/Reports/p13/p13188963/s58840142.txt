                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R pleural effusion s/p ___  // r/o
 pneumothorax      r/o pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tiny right pleural effusion has been substantially evacuated since earlier in
 the day. There is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 Opacification of the right lung base could be atelectasis alone.  Left lung
 grossly clear.  Heart size borderline enlarged.  Patient has had median
 sternotomy.  Although the sternal wires are intact and aligned, wound lucency
 through the manubrium and upper sternal body new or newly apparent on
 yesterday's chest radiograph suggests that the non fused sternum could be
 unstable.  Clinical assessment is advised.
