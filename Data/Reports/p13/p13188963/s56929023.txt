                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis on
 ___ with ptx on recent chest x-ray  // Check for interval changes in
 pneumothorax seen on imaging earlier
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small right apical pneumothorax.  The right pleural effusion has
 reaccumulated and is small to moderate in size.  There continues to be
 pulmonary vascular redistribution with hazy alveolar infiltrate most marked in
 the left lung centrally and in the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small right pneumothorax, slightly smaller than on the study from the
 prior day
 2. Small the moderate right pleural effusion that has reaccumulated compared
 to the prior exam
 3.Increase right lower lobe and left central lung infiltrate.  While some of
 this could be due to fluid overload an infectious process cannot be excluded
