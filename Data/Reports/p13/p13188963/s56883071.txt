 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 09:04.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier same day study, re-demonstrated are multiple
 median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips.  There are low lung
 volumes, likely accentuating the size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged
 from prior.  The hila are within normal limits.  There is an unchanged
 moderate right pleural effusion with fluid tracking along the right pleural
 space.  Smaller left pleural effusion is also unchanged.  There is right more
 than left bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no new focal lung consolidation. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes.
 2. Unchanged moderate right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent
 lower lobe relaxation atelectasis.
 3. No new focal lung consolidation.  No edema.
