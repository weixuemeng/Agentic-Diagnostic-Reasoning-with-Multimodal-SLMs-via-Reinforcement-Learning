 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD exacerbation, evaluation for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of an
 unchanged endotracheal tube, with the tip positioned 2.7 cm above the carina. 
 The course of the nasogastric tube is also unchanged.  The tip is not clearly
 visualized on the image but appears to project over the distal parts of the
 stomach.  There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral parenchymal
 changes suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sinus could indicate a small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged
 mild left retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
