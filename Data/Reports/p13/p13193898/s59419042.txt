                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of anterior chest pain
 status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.  There are minimal degenerative changes along the spine. 
 Evaluation of the sternum is not optimal on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note that if concern
 for sternal or rib fracture persists, suggest dedicated imaging of these
 structures, which is more sensitive.
