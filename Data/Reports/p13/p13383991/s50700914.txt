                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Drug overdose, tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but aspiration cannot
 be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities in the setting of low lung volumes most likely reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
