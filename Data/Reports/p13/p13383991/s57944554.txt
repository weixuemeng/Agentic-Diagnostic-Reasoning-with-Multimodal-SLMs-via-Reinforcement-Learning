                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Low lung volumes accentuate
 the interstitial markings.  On the lateral view projecting over the lowest
 visible level of the thoracic spine there may be a 28mm wide irregularly
 shaped lung lesion, with central lucency or air bronchograms. As expected,
 even if real--___ it could well be an artifact--___ would not be visible on a
 frontal chest radiograph.  It was not present on a Chest CTA in ___,
 and is presumably infection or infarction.  It should be investigated with an
 upright view factored for the upper abdomen and/or routine oblique CXR at deep
 inspiration.  There is no  effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible lower lobe lung infection or infarction. Dr ___ ___ I discussed
 these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
