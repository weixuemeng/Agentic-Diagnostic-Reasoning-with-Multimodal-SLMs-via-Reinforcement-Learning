                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung ca s/p recent radiation, COPD, w/
 new, worsening O2 requirement, and SOB, diffuse rhonchi on exam // assess for
 evolving infection, volume overload?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, right suprahilar and
 upper lobe opacity appears more confluent, suggestive of evolving pneumonia. 
 Right basilar and retrocardiac opacities, most consistent with atelectasis,
 have improved.  Small left and tiny right pleural effusions have decreased. 
 There is central vascular congestion with asymmetric increased vascular
 indistinctness and ___ B-lines in the left lower lobe, suggestive of
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Left juxtahilar lesion, better assessed on prior
 chest CT from ___, is stable.  Right Port-A-Cath terminates in
 the right atrium, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased confluence of right suprahilar and upper lobe opacity, concerning
 for evolving pneumonia.
 2. Central vascular congestion with probable                             
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 3. Mildly improved small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
 4. Mildly improved right basilar and retrocardiac opacities, most consistent
 with atelectasis.
 5. Stable left juxtahilar lesion, better assessed on prior chest CT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 13:34 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
