                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia, evaluate for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heterogeneous areas of
 airspace opacification at both bases likely relate to atelecatasis and
 moderate bilateral effusions; however underlying consolidation is not
 excluded. The cardiac silhouette is partially obscured.  Mediastinal contours
 are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and heterogeneous bibasilar
 opacification, atelectasis or pneumonia.
