 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with right shin pain for a couple of weeks,
 post-running marathon and history of eating disorder.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again, relatively low lung
 volumes are noted.  The lungs, however, are clear without consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits given relatively low lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
