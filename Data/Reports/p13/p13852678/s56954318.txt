                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The
 mediastinum is not widened.  Subtle lucency in the mediastinum to the right of
 the trachea may be artifactual or could relate to gaseous distention of the
 upper thoracic esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
