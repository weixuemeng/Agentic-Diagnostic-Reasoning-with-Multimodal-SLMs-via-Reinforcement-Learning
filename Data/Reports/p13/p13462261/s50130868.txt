                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___. 
 CT abdomen ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior.  Diffuse opacity in the left lower lobe and a rounded
 opacity measuring 7 mm in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis,
 however, ___ years ago on an abdominal CT, nodular opacity in the lingula and
 left lower lobe were present.  Median sternotomy wires and multiple surgical
 clips projecting over the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes is indicative of
 prior CABG. The fourth sternotomy wire is fractured on the left side, however,
 it is unchanged since ___ and there are no new breaks and alignment is
 maintained.    A right-sided hemodialysis catheter ends in the lower superior
 vena cava.  The heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild vascular congestion more
 prominent in the upper lungs.  Linear radiolucencies in the right hemithorax
 correspond to skin folds.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear opacity and 7 mm rounded opacity in the left lower lung may
 represent atelectasis but on abdominal CT performed ___ years ago nodular
 opacities were present in the lingula and left lower lobe.  Chest CT is
 recommended to document stability of these opacities.
 2.  Mild vascular congestion more prominent in the upper lungs.
