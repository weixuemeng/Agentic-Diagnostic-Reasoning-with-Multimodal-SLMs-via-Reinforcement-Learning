                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia in a patient with worsening respiratory
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright and lateral views of the chest were reviewed
 and compared to the prior study.  Mild vascular congestion has improved. The
 previously described rounded opacity in the left lower lung is not visualized
 on this study; however, as mentioned on the prior study, opacities in the
 lingula and left lower lobe seen on abdominal CT performed two year prior need
 chest CT to document stability.  The previously described left lower lobe
 linear opacity is relatively unchanged and most likely represents atelectasis.
 A right sided dialysis catheter is unchanged in position.  Median sternotomy
 wires and surgical clips overlying the mediastinum and heart are consistent
 with prior CABG.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Linear opacities overlying the left
 hemithorax correspond to skin folds.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity most likely represents atelectasis.  
 2.  Improved mild vascular congestion.
