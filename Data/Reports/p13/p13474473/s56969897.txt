                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles bilaterally may be secondary to atelectasis or small
 effusions.  This appearance is unchanged compared to prior.  The patient is
 slightly rotated, limiting evaluation of mediastinal contours.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia on this single frontal
 view.
