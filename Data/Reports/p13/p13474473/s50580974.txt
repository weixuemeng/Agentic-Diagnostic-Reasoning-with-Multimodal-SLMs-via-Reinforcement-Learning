 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain and equivocal right upper quadrant ultrasound.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are reduced
 compared to the prior study.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild thoracic aortic
 tortuosity unseen.  Calcification of the thoracic aorta is also
 redemonstrated.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no
 pulmonary edema is present.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
