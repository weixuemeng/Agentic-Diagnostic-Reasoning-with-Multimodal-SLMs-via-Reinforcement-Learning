                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and fever, rule out pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear, without focal
 consolidations to suggest pneumonia.  There is slight deviation of the trachea
 towards the right secondary to a tortuous aorta.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are stable.  Flat
 diaphragms and increased AP diameter of the chest is consistent with known
 diagnosis of COPD.  The previously mentioned left pulmonary nodular opacity is
 not seen on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence acute cardiopulmonary process.  Although a nodular
 opacity is not appreciated on this study in the left upper lobe, a nodule is
 not excluded; please see prior follow-up recommendations.
