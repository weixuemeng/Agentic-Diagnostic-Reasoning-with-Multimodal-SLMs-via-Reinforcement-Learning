                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, cough
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 The heart appears top-normal in size.  Streaky lower lung opacities likely
 represent atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding.  The hila appear slightly
 prominent though there is no overt edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  Cervical
 fusion hardware is partially visualized in the lower C-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky lower lung opacities likely atelectasis.  Top-normal heart size. 
 Mildly prominent pulmonary hila may reflects mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
