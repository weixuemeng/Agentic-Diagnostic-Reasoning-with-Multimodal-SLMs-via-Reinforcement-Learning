                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Non-specific neurological findings.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with dextra
 positioning.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Patchy
 vague opacities are present at the lung bases, but similar to prior studies,
 suggesting minor scarring.  Mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 appears similar.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An air-fluid
 level is present in the stomach.  Surgical clips project beneath the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild gastric distention with an air-fluid level.  Patchy basilar
 opacities most suggestive of minor scarring, little if at all changed.
