                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M 2 weeks status post CBD stent placement with new
 purulent output and diffuse abdominal pain  // question of CBD stent migration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  A percutaneous catheter is seen within the upper
 abdomen on the lateral view.  No subdiaphragmatic air is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
