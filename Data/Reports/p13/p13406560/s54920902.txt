 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___.
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Subtle perihilar opacities may potentially be due
 to vascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes, but differential
 diagnosis includes fluid overload and atypical pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 radiographs with improved inspiratory level would be helpful for further
 evaluation when the patient's condition permits.
