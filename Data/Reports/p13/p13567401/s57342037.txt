                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower low lung
 volumes, which may accentuate the diffuse prominence of interstitial markings
 consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is blunting of the
 costophrenic angles that could reflect some pleural fluid as well as streaks
 of atelectasis at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
