                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fractures after MVC.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with a
 combination of effusion and volume loss in a patient with previously noted
 fractures on a recent CT scan.
 
 On the right, there is colonic interposition between the superior aspect of
 the liver and the hemidiaphragm with minimal atelectatic changes.  The
 fractures seen on CT on this side are not appreciated on plain radiographs.  
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
