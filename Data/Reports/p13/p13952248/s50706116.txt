                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with question pneumonia, ileus, intubated for
 respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  There are linear opacities at the right lung base, most likely
 representing atelectasis.  Left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis
 persist.  Retrocardiac opacity is also stable.  There is no pneumothorax or
 overt pulmonary edema.  The prominence of central pulmonary vessels may
 represent mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and left pleural effusion.
