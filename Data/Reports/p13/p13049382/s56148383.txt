                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, assess for mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  On the lateral
 view, there appears to be a posterior, possibly pleural-based subtle opacity
 projecting over the upper lungs.  Given the history of hemoptysis, consider CT
 to further assess.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mass positioned posteriorly on the lateral view in the
 upper lungs.  Recommend CT to further assess.
