                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with tachycardia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable.  Opacity in the right lower
 lung most likely reflects atelectasis either in the right middle lobe or right
 lower lobe.  The rest of the lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
