                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Radiographs of the chest demonstrate no acute, displaced rib
 fracture, pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in appearance, and lungs are clear.  Elongated thorax
 configuration is consistent with history of Marfan's.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute, displaced rib fracture on this chest radiograph.  If
 clinical suspicion persists, dedicated rib films could be obtained.  No
 pneumothorax or a substantial pleural effusion.
