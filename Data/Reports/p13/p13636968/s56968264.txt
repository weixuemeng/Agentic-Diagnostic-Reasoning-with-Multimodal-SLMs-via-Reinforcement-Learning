                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with ESRD on HD with  shortness of breath. Evaluate for
 edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tunneled left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 right atrium.  The heart is enlarged.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, and in absence of priors, may represent diaphragmatic
 paralysis, which could be contributing to the patient's shortness of breath.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Obscuration of
 left heart border is indicative of a lingular opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm, may be contributing to the patient's
 shortness of breath. Correlation with prior chest radiography is recommended.
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
 3.  Tunneled dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium.
 4. Lingular opacity may represent atelectasis or infection, and warrants
 followup chest radiography.
