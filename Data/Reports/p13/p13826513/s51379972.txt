                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis  // preop workup     
 preop workup
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. There are low lung volumes but no evidence of
 cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, or definite pleural effusion.  There is
 mild asymmetry of opacification at the bases, with increase on the left. This
 most likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
 This could be a manifestation of splenomegaly.
