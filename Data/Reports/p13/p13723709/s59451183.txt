                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of the upper and mid lung zones.  The pre-existing opacities in
 these lung regions have almost completely resolved.  Relatively minor
 opacities persist at both lung bases and are likely atelectatic in origin. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  The monitoring and support devices are constant in
 appearance.
