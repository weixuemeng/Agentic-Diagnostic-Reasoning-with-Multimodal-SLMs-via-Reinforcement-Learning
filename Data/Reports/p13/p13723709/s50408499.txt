                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 10:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated for respiratory failure, assess
 endotracheal tube position.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study of ___ at 4:09.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the
 mid SVC unchanged.  There is a layering left effusion.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities are now seen suggestive of atelectasis, although a
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There has been interval
 improvement in the mild perihilar edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
