                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM FROM ___ AT 4:09
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe respiratory distress.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 18:27.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 4:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central
 line are likely unchanged in position.  The lung volumes remain low and there
 are patchy bibasilar opacities with associated likely layering effusions
 suggestive of compressive atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Since
 the prior study, there has been interval appearance of superimposed mild
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stably enlarged given patient rotation.
