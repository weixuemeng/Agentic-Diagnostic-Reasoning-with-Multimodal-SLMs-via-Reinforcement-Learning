                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath .
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung
 volumes which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart and tortuosity
 of the aorta.  There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles is
 consistent with small effusions and basilar atelectasis.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
