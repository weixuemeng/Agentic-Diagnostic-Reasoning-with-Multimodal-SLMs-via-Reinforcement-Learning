                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CHF exacerbation undergone significant
 diuresis, but having persistent shortness of breath.  Evaluation for acute
 process or change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate persistent low
 lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis and
 small bilateral pleural effusions which are stable since the prior study.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, and there is no new opacification
 worrisome for pneumonia. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is stable since
 the prior study.  A right PICC is unchanged in position, terminating in the
 low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are
 stable since the prior study.
