                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:04 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated for respiratory distress. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 17:38.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:04 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. 
 There continue to be bibasilar airspace opacities with likely associated
 pleural effusions suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although aspiration
 or pneumonia should also be considered.  There is asymmetry in the perihilar
 vasculature, right being more pronounced than the left, which is of uncertain
 clinical significance, though could indicate a component of asymmetric
 perihilar edema.  Followup imaging would be advised.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given
 differences in positioning.
