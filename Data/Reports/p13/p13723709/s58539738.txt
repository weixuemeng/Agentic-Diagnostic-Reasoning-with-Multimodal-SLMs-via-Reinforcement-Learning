                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for PICC line placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left-sided PICC line is seen with its tip ending in the left brachiocephalic
 vein and should be advanced approximately 6.5 cm for appropriate placement.  
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Again seen are patchy bibasilar opacities most likely
 atelectasis and persistent small right pleural effusion are largely unchanged.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and the hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax. Mid thoracic kyphosis is partially related
 to wedged compression of at least one vertebral body, also seen on ___ lateral view. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left-sided PICC line is seen with its tip ending in the left subclavian
 vein and should be advanced 6.5 cm for appropriate placement. 
 
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion are largely
 unchanged from the prior study.
