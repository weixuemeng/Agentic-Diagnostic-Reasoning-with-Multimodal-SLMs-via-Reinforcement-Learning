 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:29 PM
  Compared to ___ pulmonary edema is significantly improved. 
  Compared to the next most recent study of ___ there is no
  appreciable change.  The upper lung fields remain relatively well aerated.  
  Pulmonary vascular congestion persists without frank pulmonary edema. 
  Bibasilar opacities are likely a combination of small pleural effusions and
  atelectasis, stable.  Right PICC line remains in the low SVC.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, exacerbation, evaluation for shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the double-lumen catheter
 has been removed from the right internal jugular vein.  Lung volumes have
 decreased, with areas of atelectasis at both lung bases and signs of mild
 fluid overload.  However, no new parenchymal opacities are present.  No larger
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Known degenerative changes in the right
 shoulder.
