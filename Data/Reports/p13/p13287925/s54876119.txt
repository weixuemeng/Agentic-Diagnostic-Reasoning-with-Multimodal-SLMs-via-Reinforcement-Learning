                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent cholangitis and urinary tract
 infection, now readmitted with fevers, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm with associated reticular opacities at the right lung base
 which likely represent atelectasis, but in the correct clinical context,
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 may represent a trace right pleural effusion, pleural scarring, or
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The aortic knob is partially calcified with unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis or, in the correct clinical context,
 developing pneumonia.
