                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with likely gallbladder cancer with
 leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia given rising leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is
 generally widened and elongated and calcium deposits in the wall mostly at the
 level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is a
 plate atelectasis in the right hemithorax mid area but a typical pneumonic
 infiltrate cannot be identified.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  Drainage tubes are identified in the right upper abdominal quadrant
 and apparently related to the patient's gallbladder problems.
 
 In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, the at that time existing low respiratory volume has markedly improved and
 aeration of the lungs appears to be quite normal now.  The chest findings are
 now similar to what existed on chest examination of ___.
