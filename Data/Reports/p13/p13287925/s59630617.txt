  Low lung volumes though no clear consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Linear
  basilar opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No overt
  pulmonary edema or large effusions.  Apparent cardiomediastinal widening is
  unchanged from recent prior and likely due to AP technique.  ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There are increasing atelectatic zones at the lung bases.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax or other acute change.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly without presence of larger pleural effusions.
