                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and hypoxic
 respiratory failure. Also chf  // rule out worsening pulmnonary edema versus
 HP versus aspiration pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there has been progression of diffuse bilateral
 opacities.  There is more pronounced confluence in the left upper lung and
 slight oblique greater areas of confluence of the right lung.  As before, the
 right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The cardiac silhouette is obscured by the
 opacities more so than on the prior study.  No gross left effusion.  Doubt
 gross right effusion.
 
 Clips again seen in the right upper abdomen.  Clips also noted adjacent to the
 left shoulder.
 
 Left-sided line overlies the mid SVC, similar prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening of diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, compared with ___.  The appearance is non-specific and could include inflammatory
 or infectious changes as well as pulmonary edema.  Nonvisualization of gross
 pleural effusions makes pulmonary edema somewhat less likely.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the infiltrates.
