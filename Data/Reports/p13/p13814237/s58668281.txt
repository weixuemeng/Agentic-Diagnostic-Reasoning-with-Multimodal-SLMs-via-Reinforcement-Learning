                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary edema, ? hypersensitivity
 pneumonitis  // f/u for interval improvement after diuresis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:20
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, dense diffuse bilateral opacities are again seen
 with possible slight worsening in the right lung.  The appearance of the left
 lung is similar prior film.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is completely
 obscured.  Costophrenic angles remain visible, making large pleural effusions
 unlikely.  The left-sided PICC line is similar in configuration.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense diffuse alveolar infiltrates in both lungs, with probable slight
 interval worsening on the right and with resultant obscuration of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  As before, the differential includes
 inflammatory or infectious changes as well as ARDS.  While pulmonary edema
 could have a similar appearance, this may be less likely given continued
 visualization of the costophrenic angles.
