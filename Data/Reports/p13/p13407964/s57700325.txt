                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with prior study from ___:
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rigors and fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  A double-barrel
 Port-A-Cath is again seen residing over the right axilla with catheter tip
 extending to the level of the low SVC.  There is a retrocardiac opacity with
 air-fluid level likely representing known large hiatal hernia.  Left basal
 linear density is likely scarring.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Old right
 upper rib deformities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable hiatal hernia.  No pneumonia.
