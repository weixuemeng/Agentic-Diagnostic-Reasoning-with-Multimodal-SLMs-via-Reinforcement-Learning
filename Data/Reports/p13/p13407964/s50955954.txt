 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.  The heart
 is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Multifocal streaky opacities appear unchanged in the left
 lung, indicating scarring.  New linear opacities in the right mid to lower
 lung suggest minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No free air is identified.  Mild loss among mid-to-lower
 thoracic vertebral body heights appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease or free air.
