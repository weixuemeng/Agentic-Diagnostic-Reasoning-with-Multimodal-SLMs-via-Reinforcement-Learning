                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT torso.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC.  The heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  A large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.  Aortic knob
 is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 new focal consolidation is identified, and there is no pneumothorax. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change compared to the prior exam with small right
 pleural effusion and left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.  Large hiatal
 hernia.
