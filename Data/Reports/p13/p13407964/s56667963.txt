                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bone pain.  Multiple myeloma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Skeletal survey ___, chest radiograph with rib
 series ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath device is seen
 with tip terminating in the SVC.  A moderate to large-sized hiatal hernia is
 re-demonstrated along with mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis and
 are similar when compared to the prior study.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine, the osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized.  No gross lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormality is present. 
 No acute fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No definite focal lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormality is seen.
 2.  Moderate to large hiatal hernia and unchanged bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.
