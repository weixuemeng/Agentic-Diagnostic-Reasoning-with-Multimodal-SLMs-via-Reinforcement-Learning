 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Myeloma, poorly functioning port, evaluation for port placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The right pectoral port is in unchanged position, and the
 intravascular component of the device shows unchanged course.  There is
 unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and presence of a large hiatal hernia with
 subsequent areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.  However, no acute
 changes in the lung parenchyma are seen.  No pneumothorax, no larger pleural
 effusions.  Unchanged areas of atelectasis at the left lung base.  No newly
 appeared parenchymal pathology.
