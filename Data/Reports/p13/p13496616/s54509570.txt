  Right PICC line is in the mid to low SVC.  Enteric tube terminates in the
  stomach.  There is large consolidation at the right base likely reflecting
  some combination of pleural effusion and consolidation possibly aspiration or
  pneumonia.  There is also left retrocardiac opacity.
  
  ___.4 x 4 cm radiodensity projecting over the left mid chest wall may reflect
  chest wall calcification.  If further evaluation is desired a lateral
  projection would be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent AF ablation, p/w tachyarrhytmia,
 report of aspiration at OSH.  // ? aspiration, consolidation, also please eval
 OSH PICC placement
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC line is in the mid to low SVC.  Enteric tube terminates in the
 stomach.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with bibasal
 opacities.  No interstitial edema.  Calcified mass projecting over the left
 hemithorax peripherally measuring ___.4 x 4 cm is a calcified pleural plaque. 
 There also calcified diaphragmatic and mediastinal calcified pleural plaques. 
 A possible pneumothorax is seen lateral to this large calcified pleural
 plaque.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive unilateral left-sided calcified pleural disease can be seen with
 prior infection or hemothorax.
 
 Possible small left loculated pneumothorax.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left with bibasal opacities.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with lateral decubitus radiograph.
