                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Specifically, no
 pneumothorax.
