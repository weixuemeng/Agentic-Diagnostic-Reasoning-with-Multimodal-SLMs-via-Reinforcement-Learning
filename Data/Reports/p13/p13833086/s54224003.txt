                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of dementia, CVA,
 hypertension, and multiple falls who presented to the emergency department
 with another fall and admitted to intensive care unit for hypotension with
 systolic blood pressure of 90, being treated for aspiration pneumonia. 
 Evaluate for progression of pneumonia.
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits paying attention to AP
 technique.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta
 unremarkable with the exception of some calcium deposits in the wall at the
 level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of
 acute parenchymal infiltrates are present.  The right lateral pleural sinus is
 free; however, there is a small amount of pleural density blunting the left
 lateral pleural sinus, and some crowded vasculature on the left base suggests
 some degree of atelectasis.  Acute new infiltrates cannot be identified on
 this portable single view chest examination.  No pneumothorax exists in the
 apical area.  Our records do not include a previous chest examination
 available for comparison.
