                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with acute-onset cold pulseless
 foot, preop.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 Left mid lung and lower lobe linear atelectasis/scarring is seen.  No focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are relatively
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, which may relate to COPD. 
 The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
