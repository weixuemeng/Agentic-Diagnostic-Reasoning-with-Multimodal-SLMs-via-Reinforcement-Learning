                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Amiodarone, to assess for toxicity.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. 
 Nodular opacification is seen at the right base medially.  This may be
 slightly more prominent than the study of more than ___ years previously, but
 appears to be quite dense and sharply round and most likely represents a
 granulomatous process.
 
 No acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
