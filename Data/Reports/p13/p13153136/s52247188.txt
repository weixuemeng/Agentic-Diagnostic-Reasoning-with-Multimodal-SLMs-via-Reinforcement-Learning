                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p unwitnessed fall  // unwitnessed fall; poor
 historian; left eye ecchymosis and edema
 
 COMPARISON:  The comparison is made with prior studies including ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study, there is marked interval change with obscuration of the
 right lung base.  There appears to be a large effusion on the lateral film and
 there is atelectasis in the right lung base.  There is added density in the
 region of the right hila which could represent atelectasis, adenopathy or
 mass.
 
 There is a gas density in the right lower chest which could represent lung or
 possibly subdiaphragmatic air or bowel.  I would recommend a right-side-up
 decubitus film to evaluate for pneumoperitoneum or pneumothorax.
 
 There is blunting of the left CP suggesting small effusion.  There is no CHF.
 
 Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is obscuration of the right lung base and there appears to be a large
 effusion present and adjacent atelectasis.  There is added density in the
 region of the right hila which could represent atelectasis, adenopathy or
 mass.
 A right-side-up lateral decubitus exam is recommended to evaluate for the
 possibility of subdiaphragmatic gas or pneumothorax.  These findings were
 discussed with Dr. ___ in the emergency room.
