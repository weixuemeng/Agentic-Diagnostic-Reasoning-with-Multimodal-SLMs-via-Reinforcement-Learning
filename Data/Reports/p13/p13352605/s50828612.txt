 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change in pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube is again present in standard position. An enteric tube
 is present in the stomach with distal tip not captured on the current study. A
 left internal jugular line is present with tip terminating in the left
 brachiocephalic vein, also in unchanged position.  Left ventricular pacer lead
 is in unchanged position. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 Overall, there is no change in small bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis.  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema remains.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly unchanged appearance of bilateral pleural effusions with
 atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema.
