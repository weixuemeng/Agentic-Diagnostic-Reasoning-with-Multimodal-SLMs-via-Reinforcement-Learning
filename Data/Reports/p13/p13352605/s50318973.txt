 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema with crackles at the lung bases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.

 The heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness with
 increased interstitial and alveolar opacities diffusely, but most pronounced
 in the lung bases compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
