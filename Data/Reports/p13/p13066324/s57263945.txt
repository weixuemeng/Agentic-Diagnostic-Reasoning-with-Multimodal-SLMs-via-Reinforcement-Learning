                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post DHT placement.  Evaluate position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 There is an apparent ___- or oro-gastric tube with radiopaque tip present. 
 The tube forms a haripin loop over the upper mediastinum and the tip overlies
 the lower neck.  
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There are bibasilar opacities with a small left
 and possible small right effusion.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF.  Probable diffuse osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tube with hairpin curve in upper mediastinum  and with tip
 overlying lower neck.  Repositioning required.  Please see report of
 already-obtained subsequent film from 10:22 a.m. on the same day,
 demonstrating that this has been addressed.
