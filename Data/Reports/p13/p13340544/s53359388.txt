                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post fall with headstrike, on Coumadin,
 bruising and tenderness to left superior orbit, tenderness to left anterior
 knee/patella
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT trachea ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection
 is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
