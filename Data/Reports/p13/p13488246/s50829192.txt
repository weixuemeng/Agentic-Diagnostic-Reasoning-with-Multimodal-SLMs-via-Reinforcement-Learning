                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:03
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with bowel ischemia.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study ___ at 4:40 a.m.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Endotracheal tube and left internal jugular central line are
 unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably
 enlarged.  There is interval worsening of a bilateral interstitial process,
 likely reflecting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  In addition, there are
 layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace disease, left
 greater than right, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  No pneumothorax.
