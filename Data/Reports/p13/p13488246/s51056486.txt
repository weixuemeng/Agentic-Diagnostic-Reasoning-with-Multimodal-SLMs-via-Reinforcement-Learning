                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post tracheostomy.  Assess for placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal views of the chest. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A tracheostomy tube is seen in standard position.  The right PICC is seen
 terminating in the mid SVC.  A left internal jugular line is seen in
 terminating at the origin of the SVC.  A feeding tube is seen with its tip in
 the stomach and should be advanced approximately 5 cm so that all side ports
 are beyond the GE junction.  
 
 The lung volumes are low and the previously seen bilateral airspace opacities
 consistent with pulmonary edema are largely unchanged from the prior study. 
 There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis, which is minimally improved from
 prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are grossly
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Tracheostomy tube in standard position.  
 
 2. Feeding tube should be advanced approximately 4-5 cm so that all the side
 ports are beyond the GE junction.
