                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with possible L upper lobe mass  // evaluate e/o
 mass L upper lobe or other acute abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph and neck CT ___ and previous
 chest CT of ___.
 
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Marked volume loss in the left hemi thorax is similar to the recent
 radiograph, and is a long-standing finding since prior chest CT of ___.  A
 masslike opacity persists in the left upper lobe, and has been more fully
 evaluated by previous CT chest which demonstrated that it was partially
 calcified.  Pleural and parenchymal scarring at the left base are probably
 similar to prior studies as well as localize scarring in the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe masslike opacity is not well characterized radiographically. 
 Consider chest CT to confirm long-term stability if warranted clinically.
