                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, bronchoscopy with biopsy of the left upper lobe,
 now with fever and rigor.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to plain film from
 ___ and chest CT from ___.  New compared to prior,
 however, is a left basilar opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm,
 potentially related to interval development of pneumonia.  There is a possible
 underlying effusion and left upper lung region of consolidation again seen. 
 Surgical chain sutures project over left upper lobe.  Right lung is
 essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Hypertrophic
 changes in the spine and likely post-surgical changes seen at the right
 acromion and right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm suspicious for pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. 
 Underlying effusion and component of atelectasis is also possible.  Left upper
 lobe region of consolidation is again seen as well.
