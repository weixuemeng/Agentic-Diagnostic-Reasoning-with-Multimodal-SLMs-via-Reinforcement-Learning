                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with previous rib fracture with worsening
 left-sided chest pain.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is minimal left
 basilar opacity at the left costophrenic angle likely due to atelectasis. 
 There is no effusion and the lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Angulation of the left lateral ninth rib
 is compatible with fracture.  Lower thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lateral ninth rib fracture identified with likely adjacent
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax seen.
