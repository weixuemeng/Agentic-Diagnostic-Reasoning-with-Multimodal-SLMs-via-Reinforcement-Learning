   Multifocal parenchymal opacities are more pronounced than on the recent
  comparison. Given the short time course this likely reflects worsening of
  pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of multifocal pneumonia (though
  pulmonary hemorrhage can also evolve in a short time course). Small left
  pleural effusion is unchanged.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 severity of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, with newly appeared
 consolidations in the retrocardiac lung areas that are likely atelectatic in
 nature.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
