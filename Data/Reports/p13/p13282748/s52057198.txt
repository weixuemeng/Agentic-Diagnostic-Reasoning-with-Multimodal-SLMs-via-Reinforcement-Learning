                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF who has worsening hypotension, dyspnea.
 // Any movement of the PICC s/p removal of IJ?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ central venous catheter has been removed.  The projection is
 slightly lordotic, with which limits evaluation of the presents position of
 the right-sided PICC line.  However, its tip is likely close to the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. A left pectoral
 AICD and multiple pacer leads remain in place. The patient has had previous
 CABG. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.  Minimal left
 basilar retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis is stable. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC line likely terminates very close to the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  No other relevant change.
