                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chronic cough.  Evaluate for
 cardiopulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are linear opacities at the left base which may be due to a
 chronic process such as interstitial lung disease.  Opacities at the right
 base may represent infectious process in the right clinical setting. The upper
 lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for mild
 cardiomegaly.  There are no acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities which have a chronic appearance on the left and
 possibly acute process on the right. If the patient has acute symptoms,
 recommend treatment and repeat radiographs to check for resolution. If these
 are chronic symptoms, would consider CT chest to evaluate for interstitial
 lung disease. 
 
 These findings were entered into the critical results dashboard by Dr.
 ___ at 11:50am.
