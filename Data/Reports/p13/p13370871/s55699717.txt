                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated transfer, evaluate for ETT placement,
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal to terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina.  An enteric
 tube tip is within the stomach however side port is proximal to the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by approximately 8 cm for
 optimal positioning.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is markedly
 tortuous.  Mild pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Additionally, ill-defined
 alveolar opacities are seen predominant within the lung bases, potentially
 aspiration or infection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Enteric tube tip in the stomach,
 however the side port is proximal to the gastroesophageal junction.  The
 enteric tube should be advanced by approximately 8 cm for optimal positioning.
 2. Ill-defined alveolar opacities in the lung bases may reflect infection or
 aspiration.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.
