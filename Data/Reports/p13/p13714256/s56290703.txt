                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory distress, junky chest on
 physical exam and with fever, history of MSSA endocarditis, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral increased reticular markings with more confluent and
 nodulear opacities in the lower lung zones are worse and likely a combination
 of worsening pulmonary edema and septic emboli.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 place. Left PICC catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Bony structures are intact. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings with overlying nodular opacities,
 worse since the recent prior and most consistent with pulmonary edema and
 septic emboli.
