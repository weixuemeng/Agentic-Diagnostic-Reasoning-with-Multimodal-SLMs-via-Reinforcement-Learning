                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of endocarditis and chest x-ray with
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Tracheostomy tube and right PICC are
 noted.  Left IJ line is no longer seen.  There is new essentially complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax.  There is no definite shift of the
 mediastinum.  Right lung is notable for pulmonary vascular congestion.  Median
 sternotomy wires again noted.  Osseous and soft tissues are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Essentially complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely due to
 combination of atelectasis and underlying effusion.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion without consolidation seen on the right.
