                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endocarditis, sepsis, intubation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing
 parenchymal opacities at the right lung base and in the left perihilar area
 have substantially decreased in extent and severity.  As a consequence, the
 lung parenchyma is more transparent and lucent than before.  The image shows
 no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is constant and normal.  No pulmonary edema.  The monitoring and
 support devices are in unchanged position.
