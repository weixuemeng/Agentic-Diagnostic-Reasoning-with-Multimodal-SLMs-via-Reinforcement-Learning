 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. 
 Right lower lobe and right perihilar opacities have increased consistent with
 increasing atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac
 opacities have worsened, consistent with worsening atelectasis.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery.  Right PICC tip is in the middle
 SVC.  Tracheostomy tube in standard position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Small left pleural effusion has increased.
