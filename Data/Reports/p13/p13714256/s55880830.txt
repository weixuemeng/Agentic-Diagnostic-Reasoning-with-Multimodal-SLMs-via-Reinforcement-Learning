 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endocarditis, left-sided chest pain.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the severity and
 distribution of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities is constant.  In
 addition, there is a newly appeared, very mild increase in density along the
 left chest wall.  This increase in density is associated with a small
 consolidation at the left lung base.  The changes could reflect either
 atelectasis or be part of the known infectious process.  There is no evidence
 of left pleural effusion.  Short-term radiographic monitoring is required.
 
 Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with signs of minimal
 fluid overload.  No pneumothorax.  The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged
 position.
