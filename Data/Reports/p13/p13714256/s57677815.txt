                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New fever in a patient with known endocarditis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Substantial interval improvement in pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Still
 present left perihilar opacity and right perihilar opacities most likely
 reflect residual of prior infection, but focal areas of infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.
