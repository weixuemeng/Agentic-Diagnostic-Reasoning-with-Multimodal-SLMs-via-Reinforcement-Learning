                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, thorax tube appears to have
 been removed.  There is some increasing opacification at the left base
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and probably a
 small reaccumulation of pleural fluid.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Right lung is essentially unchanged.
