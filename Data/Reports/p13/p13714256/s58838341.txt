                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with MSSA endocarditis and multiple embolic
 phenomena now with HCAP and fever and somnolence.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 which makes it difficult to determine if there has been interval change in the
 pneumonia.  There is definitely no interval improvement, but cannot say
 certainly if there has been worsening or not.  There are no pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is located in the same position as on
 previous imaging.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interpretation limited by low lung volumes, but bilateral
 pneumonia appears to be same as on previous imaging, though cannot exclude
 interval worsening.
