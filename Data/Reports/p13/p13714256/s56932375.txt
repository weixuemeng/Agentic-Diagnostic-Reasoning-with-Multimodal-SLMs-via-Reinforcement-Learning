                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic emboli, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been decrease in the
 bilateral opacifications most likely representing some combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.  Some residual patchy opacification persists on the
 right and there is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, which suggests
 volume loss in the lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreasing effusions with persistent consolidation on the right
 and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
