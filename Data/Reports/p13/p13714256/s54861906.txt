                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with endocarditis and septic emboli, now with increased
 secretions.  Is there change of status?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There is bilateral new consolidation, more
 prominent at the right lung base.  There is also mild bilateral pleural
 effusion with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  The tracheostomy is in
 adequate position at 2.5 cm above the carina.  The left-sided PICC line ends
 at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contour are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 There are new bilateral alveolar consolidations that could be compatible with
 multifocal pneumonia.
