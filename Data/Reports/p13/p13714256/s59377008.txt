 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with endocarditis and sepsis.  OG tube was
 replaced.  Evaluate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Orogastric tube ends in the distal stomach.  ET tube in standard placement. 
 Previous vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema has cleared in the
 upper lungs, but consolidation in the lower lungs, particularly the right has
 worsened, though this could be atelectasis, is more concerning for extensive
 pneumonia.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement and a right internal jugular line ends in the
 upper right atrium.
