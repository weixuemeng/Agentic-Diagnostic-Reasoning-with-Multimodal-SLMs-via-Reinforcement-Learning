                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma to the chest wall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe is compatible with atelectasis. 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle on the right suggests a trace
 pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is visualized.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal. A non-displaced fracture of the left second lateral rib is present as
 well as a minimally displaced fracture of the right lateral tenth rib.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Non-displaced fracture of the left second rib laterally and
 minimally displaced fracture of the right lateral tenth rib.  Trace right
 pleural effusion.  Left basilar atelectasis.
