                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated and tilted to the left on the PA view, similar to prior
 studies.  Mild cardiomegaly and a calcified aorta are again seen.  Hilar
 contours are stable.  Linear opacities in bilateral basal lower lobes are
 similar to prior.  There is no evidence for pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, or pleural effusion.  Degenerative changes and ossification of the
 anterior longitudinal ligament are again seen in the thoracic spine.  Right
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper right atrium, unchanged.  Surgical clips
 are again seen in the upper abdomen just to the left of midline.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearance of the chest, including chronic linear opacities in
 bilateral basal lower lobes, without evidence for pneumonia.
