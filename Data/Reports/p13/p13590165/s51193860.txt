 pneumonia

 Lung volumes remain low, but no focal pulmonary abnormality is seen aside from
 minimal bibasilar atelectasis, understandable in the setting of persistent
 small pleural effusions and the elevated diaphragm.  Heart size exaggerated by
 low lung volumes, is probably normal.  Right supraclavicular central venous
 infusion port catheter ends in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
