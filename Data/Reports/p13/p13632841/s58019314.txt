 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lead

 Lower lobe linear atelectasis is seen on the lateral view.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is borderline in size.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild basilar atelectasis.  Borderline cardiac silhouette size. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
