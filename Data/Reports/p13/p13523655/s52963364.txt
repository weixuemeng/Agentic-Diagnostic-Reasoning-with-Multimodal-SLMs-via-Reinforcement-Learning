                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple rib fractures, evaluate
 rib fractures.
 
 Patient's condition did not permit examination in upright position.  An AP
 frontal chest view was obtained with patient in semi-upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.
 The findings are grossly unchanged in comparison with the previous portable
 examination.  Two parallel running ___ stabilization rods along the
 thoracic spine as before.  A new metallic plate is overlying the midline
 structure of the thorax.  Multiple rib fractures are again seen along the left
 lower chest wall, coinciding with some local pleural thickening.  No
 significant blunting of the lateral pleural sinus.  No acute pulmonary
 infiltrates are seen, but possibility of atelectasis in left lower lung
 retrocardiac location cannot be excluded with certainty.  In comparison with
 the next preceding portable study, no significant interval change.  For detail
 of skeletal injuries and evaluation of thoracic aorta, see CT chest
 examination of ___, including detail that cannot be obtained on
 single portable chest view.
