                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ileus who presents for evaluation of NG
 tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left-sided PICC line terminates in the proximal superior vena
 cava.  The tip of the enteric tube is difficult to visualize on this exam. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with stable pulmonary vascular
 congestion and bilateral minimal pulmonary edema.  Again rightward deviation
 of the trachea is seen secondary to known enlargement of the left lobe of the
 thyroid.  No new focal consolidation, significant pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Tip of the enteric tube cannot be visualized on this exam.  Recommend repeat
 radiographs to confirm tip placement.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:23 a.m. by Dr. ___
 ___ by telephone on the day of the exam.
