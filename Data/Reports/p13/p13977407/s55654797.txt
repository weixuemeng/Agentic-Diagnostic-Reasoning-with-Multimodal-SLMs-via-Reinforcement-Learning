                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for resolution of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, the right lower lobe pneumonia has
 resolved. In the right lower lobe, a 6-mm nodule is probably the composite of
 superimposed normal structures, but to exclude a lung nodule, I recommend
 followup PA, lateral, and shallow oblique chest radiographs in six weeks. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinum is normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lower lobe pneumonia resolved.
 2.  Possible small right lower lobe nodule.  Recommend followup radiographs in
 six weeks, including shallow oblique views.
 
 Results were posted to the online record of critical results for direct
 notification of the referring physician.
