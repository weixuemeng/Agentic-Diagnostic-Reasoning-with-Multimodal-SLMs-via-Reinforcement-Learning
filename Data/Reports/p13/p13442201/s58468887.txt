                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Single-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  Cardiomegaly persists, although appears
 slightly less prominent as compared to the prior study.  There is no focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  Minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion may be present without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Overall, there is no significant interval change since the prior study.
