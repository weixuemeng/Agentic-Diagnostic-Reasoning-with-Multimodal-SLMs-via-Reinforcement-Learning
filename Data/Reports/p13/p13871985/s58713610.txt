                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is associated right basilar
 atelectasis.  Mild pleural thickening and scattered calcifications are
 present.  There is mild central bronchiectasis and fibrosis within right lung.
 The left lung appears normal.  There is no pneumothorax. No fracture is
 detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Moderate right lung volume loss with mild central bronchiectasis with
 pleural thickening fibrosis, all appearing chronic. The left lung appears
 normal. No superimposed acute process seen.
 2. No fractures detected. This technique is not optimized for evaluation of
 osseous trauma; dedicated rib films with localizing markers can be obtained if
 there is a clinical concern for fracture.
