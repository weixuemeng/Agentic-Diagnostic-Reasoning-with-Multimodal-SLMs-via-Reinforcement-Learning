                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath  // acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of the same-day 1 hr prior.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widespread interstitial lung opacities are similar to the study 1 hr prior,
 allowing for differences in inspiratory effort.  Findings remain consistent
 with pulmonary edema and possible superimposed infection.  Alternatively,
 acute lung disease is a possibility. Otherwise, no relevant change since the
 prior exam.
