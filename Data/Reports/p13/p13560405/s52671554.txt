                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with vomiting, concern for  aspiration  //
 possible aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volume is small.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities have increased
 compared to prior, more on the left.  The right opacity is more likely
 atelectasis.  Although the left lower lobe opacities do not obscure the left
 heart border or left hemidiaphragm, pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  A lateral
 chest radiograph could provide more definitive information.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The hila and pulmonary vasculature are normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacities could be due to pneumonia.  Lateral views radiograph
 would provide more definitive information.  The right lower lobe opacity is
 more likely atelectasis.
