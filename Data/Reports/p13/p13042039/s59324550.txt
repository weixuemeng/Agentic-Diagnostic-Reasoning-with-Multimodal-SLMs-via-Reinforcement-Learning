                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs. An opacity projecting over the lower
 thoracic spine does not have a definite correlate on frontal view, and is
 likely due to a combination of respiratory motion artifact and overlapping
 bony structures.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
