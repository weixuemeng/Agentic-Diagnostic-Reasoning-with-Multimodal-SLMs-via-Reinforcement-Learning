                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L sided rib fxs, L pulm contusion, evaluate
 for interval change in pulmonary contusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and CT torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar platelike
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The posterolateral left 6 rib fracture appears more moderately
 displaced when compared with the prior study, possibly made more prominent by
 differences in rotation.  Additional left-sided rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. More moderately displaced left sixth rib fracture may be accentuated by
 differences in rotation.
 2. Low lung volumes without new consolidation, pneumothorax, or enlarging
 effusion.
