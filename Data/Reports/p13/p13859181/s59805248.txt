                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PE s/p tPA, intubated, requiring
 intra-aortic balloon pump.  // Compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The
 monitoring and support devices, including the intra-aortic balloon pump and
 Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have minimally
 increased, potentially as a result of increased ventilatory pressure. Moderate
 pulmonary edema persists. The left lower lobe atelectasis is also unchanged.
