 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe appears

 fluid, as seen on chest CT.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable, and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patient is
 status post right lower lobectomy.  Small to moderate size right pleural
 effusion is re- demonstrated.  The left lung is clear.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Small to moderate size right pleural effusion.  Unchanged widening of the
 right paratracheal stripe, likely due to postsurgical changes.
