                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R VATS RLL  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, there is increased right
 pleural effusion with new right middle lobe collapse.  Widening of the
 mediastinum has decreased and reflects expected postsurgical changes.  Right
 apical pneumothorax, as well as left lower lobe atelectasis, have resolved. 
 Cardiac size is difficult to assess in the presence of effusion, though likely
 mildly enlarged, stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased right pleural effusion with new right middle lobe collapse.
 2. Improved widening of the mediastinum, reflecting expected postsurgical
 changes.
 3. Resolved right apical pneumothorax and left lower lobe atelectasis.
 4. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
