                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, history of congestive heart failure
 and pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided stimulator device is noted with lead coursing cephalad into the
 left neck.  Patient is status post thyroidectomy with clips noted about the
 lower neck.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left, appears slightly
 increased in size compared to the previous radiograph.  Bibasilar opacities in
 the lungs likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left,
 compared to prior chest radiograph from ___.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis.
