 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no significant interval change.  Moderate left and small right
 pleural effusions are again noted.  Increased interstitial markings are
 similar in appearance.  More dense bibasilar opacities may be due to
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Electronic
 device projects over left chest wall as on prior.  Surgical clips project over
 the neck.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with mild edema, not
 dramatically changed since earlier exam.
 Bibasilar opacities potentially atelectasis in the setting of effusions noting
 that infection cannot be excluded.
