 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been a left
 thoracentesis with removal of pleural fluid.  No evidence of appreciable post
 procedure pneumothorax.  Some residual opacification is again seen at the left
 base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the lower
 lobe and residual pleural effusion.
 The left basilar chest tube appears to have been removed with no definite
 pneumothorax.
