  1. Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of stable cardiomegaly.
  
  2. Irregular 1.5 cm nodule adjacent to the mediastinum in the left mid lung
  was not clearly seen in the previous exam and likely represents a pulmonary
  vessel on end and further assessed with chest CT on a nonemergent basis should
  be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Study ___-year-old male with lower extremity swelling, shortness of
 breath, dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings, hilar
 indistinctness and vascular upper redistribution compatible with interstitial
 pulmonary edema. Of note a 1.5 cm irregular nodule is seen adjacent to the
 mediastinum in the left mid lung.  A small right-sided pleural effusion is
 present. No left-sided effusion is identified. There is no pneumothorax.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of stable cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Irregular 1.5 cm nodule adjacent to the mediastinum in the left mid lung
 was not clearly seen in the previous exam and should be further assessed with
 CT on a nonemergent basis.
