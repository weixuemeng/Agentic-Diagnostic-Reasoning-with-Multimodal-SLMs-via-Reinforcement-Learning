                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta remains
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, and an element of mild pulmonary vascular congestion cannot be
 completely excluded.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases are similar compared
 to the prior study, and likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present, and no focal consolidation is demonstrated. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Pneumonia in the lung
 bases, however, cannot be completely excluded.
