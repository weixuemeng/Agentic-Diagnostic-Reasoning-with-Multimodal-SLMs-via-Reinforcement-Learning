 hypoxia and pleuritic chest pain, she has a IVC filter and is on lovenox ___
 bid  // acute pulmonary process causing hypoxia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and abdominal radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a very large left-sided pleural effusion with complete collapse of
 the left lower lobe and the lingula.  This has increased significantly in size
 when compared to the prior abdominal radiograph.  The right lung appears
 grossly clear.  No right-sided pleural effusion seen.  A dense nodular opacity
 at the left apex is likely due to multiple overlapping bony structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval increase in the left-sided pleural effusion with near
 complete collapse of the left lung sparing only in the apical portion of the
 left upper lobe.
