                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with asthma, shortness of breath and chest tightness
 x 1 week
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Increased interstitial opacities within the lung bases and
 periphery of both lungs are not substantially changed in the interval,
 previously thought reflect UIP.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is definitively noted.  Multiple clips are seen in the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with chronic interstitial lung disease, not substantially
 changed since the previous radiograph, and thought to reflect UIP on prior
 chest CT.  No new focal consolidation.
