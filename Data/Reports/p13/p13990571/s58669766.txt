                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of asthma.  Shortness of breath and wheeze.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal AP view of the chest shows new hazy opacification
 at the right base.  In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are
 lower.  This may be accentuating the lung markings in the right base, and
 related to atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, a pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  The low lung volumes are also accentuating the heart
 size, which is moderately enlarged, and seems to be slightly larger than in
 the prior exam.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema.  Surgical material is seen at the gastroesophageal junction,
 and unchanged from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Hazy opacification of the right base may be due to atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly.
