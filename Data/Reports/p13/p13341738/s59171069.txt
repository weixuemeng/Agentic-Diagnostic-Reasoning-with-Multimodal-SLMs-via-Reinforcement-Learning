                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of altered mental status
 and fever, slumping to the right.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, particularly
 at the lung bases.  Given this, there is minimal elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP
 portable, semi-erect technique and low lung volumes.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings
 particularly at the lung bases.  Given this, there may be mild right base
 atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation seen.  Possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
