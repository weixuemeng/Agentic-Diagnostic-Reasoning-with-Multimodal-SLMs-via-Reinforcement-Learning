                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with possible lung nodule on a chest x-ray at an
 outside hospital.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of any prior chest
 imaging.
 
 Lungs are clear of any obvious abnormality, though there is a suggestion of
 small irregular opacities projecting over the left second anterior interspace
 and in the right chest laterally.  These could be the residua of findings
 noted elsewhere, but we need to compare this examination with prior studies
 side by side.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal, and there is no pleural
 abnormality.
