                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:15 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, possible edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 1:30 a.m.:
 
 Somewhat asymmetric pulmonary edema has improved in the perihilar regions
 since earlier in the day.  Severe cardiomegaly and at least a small left
 pleural effusion persist.  Conventional radiographs would be required to see
 if the pulmonary findings are more extensive than just edema.
