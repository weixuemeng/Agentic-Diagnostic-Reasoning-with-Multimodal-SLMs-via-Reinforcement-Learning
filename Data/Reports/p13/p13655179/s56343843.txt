                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with asthma, new respiratory infection, subjective fever.
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 On the frontal view, the lungs are clear; however, on the lateral view, there
 are subtle linear opacities overlying the heart which were not present on the
 previous exam.  This could only represent a rib, but beginning of pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiac
 contour is normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Subtle linear opacities overlying the heart seen only on the lateral view
 could be an artifact from the rib, however, infection cannot be excluded in
 appropriate clinical settings.  
 
 The results were posted to the radiology dashboard for direct notification of
 the referring physician.
