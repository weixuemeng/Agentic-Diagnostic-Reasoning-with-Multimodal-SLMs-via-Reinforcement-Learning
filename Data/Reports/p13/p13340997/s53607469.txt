                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AMS  // ?acute intrathoracic process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the CT chest obtained ___, there appears to be
 increased narrowing of the trachea and widening of the right paratracheal
 stripe.  On CT, this appeared to be due to a large brachiocephalic trunk. 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear without consolidations or effusions. Heart
 size is normal.  Aortic knob and thoracic descending aorta are heavily
 calcified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are otherwise normal.
 Pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Narrowing of the trachea may be caused by a a large brachiocephalic trunk or
 alternatively lymphadenopathy or hematoma in the appropriate clinical
 settings.
