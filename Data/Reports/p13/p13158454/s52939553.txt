 INDICATION:  Cough and back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding.  No clear
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  An opacity at the right
 base appears plate-like and is felt to represent atelectasis.  There is
 chronic vascular congestion.  No significant pleural effusion is present.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Slight relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is unchanged.  A previously seen right-sided internal jugular venous catheter
 has been removed. The heart size is top normal.
