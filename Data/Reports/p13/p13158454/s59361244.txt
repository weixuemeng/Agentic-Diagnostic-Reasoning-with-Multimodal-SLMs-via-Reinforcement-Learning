                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF and worsening lower extremity edema and
 hyponatremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 there appears to be mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  Very mild
 vascular congestion.  There is mild right basilar atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusions are seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  There is compression deformity in the upper lumbar spine, not well
 assessed, but also seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there may be pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
