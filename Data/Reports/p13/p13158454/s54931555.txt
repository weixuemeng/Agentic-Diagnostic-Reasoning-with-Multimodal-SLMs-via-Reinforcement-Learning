                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with CKD, CHF, CAD, presenting with right upper
 quadrant/right chest/right flank pain, radiographic signs of pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart appears to be mildly enlarged.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  Again, blunting of the right costophrenic angle is noted
 along with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  This could be due to
 atelectasis or in the proper clinical context could represent underlying
 pneumonia; however, the degree of opacification has not significantly changed
 from the prior study. No pneumothorax. Bony structures appear to be intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The right lower lobe opacity which probably represents a small
 amount of pleural effusion with an overlying atelectasis or possibly pneumonia
 in the right clinical context, has not significantly changed since the prior
 exam.
