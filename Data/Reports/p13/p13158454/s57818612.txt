                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with diffuse extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar predominantly linear opacities
 most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia is a possibility; right
 middle lobe consolidation also may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 appear stable.  Minimally increased interstitial prominence may reflect very
 mild edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, which could represent
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
 2.  Minimal increase in interstitial prominence compared to prior, which may
 reflect acquisition technique or very mild edema.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 2:25 p.m.
