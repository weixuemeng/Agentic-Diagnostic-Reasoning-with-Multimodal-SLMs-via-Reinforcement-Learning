                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is normal in size.  As before,
 there is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  An unchanged
 band-like opacity in the lingula suggests minor scarring.  There is a new
 posterior opacity in the right lower lobe silhouetting the hemidiaphragm with
 a small suspected pleural effusion.  A trace pleural effusion is suspected on
 the left side.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the
 appropriate setting with a small associated pleural effusion although
 substantial atelectasis could also be considered.
