                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and oxygen requirement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes continue to be slightly low; however, there is
 improved aeration at the right base.  There continues to be a small area of
 volume loss/infiltrate/infarction in the right lower lung laterally, somewhat
 improved in appearance compared to the prior from eight hours ago.  Recommend
 continued followup and clinical correlation.  No other substantial changes.
