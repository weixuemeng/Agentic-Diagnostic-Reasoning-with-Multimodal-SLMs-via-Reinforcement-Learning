                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is unchanged, top normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits given the low lung volumes. 
 Bronchovascular crowding is present, but no overt pulmonary edema is noted. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitely seen. 
 There is likely minimal atelectasis in the lung bases.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
