                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever and hypotension, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of a top-normal heart
 size versus mild cardiomegaly.  The hila are within normal limits.  Opacity at
 the right cardiophrenic angle likely represents crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures.  Elsewhere, there is no focal lung consolidation. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Borderline/mild cardiomegaly.   No pulmonary edema.  No focal lung
 consolidation.
