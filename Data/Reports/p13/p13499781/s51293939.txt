                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple myeloma complicated by neutropenia,
 HFpEF presents with cough and lower extremity edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.  Heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Calcified granulomas are again
 scattered in both lungs, the largest in the left apex.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, however the
 extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  Known
 myeloma involvement of the left fifth rib is better assessed on the previous
 chest CT.  Degenerative changes are again noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
