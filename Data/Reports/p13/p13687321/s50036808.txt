                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Urosepsis and a new oxygen requirement.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are significantly
 decreased.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated in comparison to the left. 
 The patient is rotated, limiting evaluation.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  An irregular
 calcification overlying the right mid lung zone is unchanged.  The aorta is
 tortuous, and stable.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, and stable.  Old
 left sided rib fractures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very low lung volumes, limiting the evaluation, and making a
 component of pulmonary edema difficult to exclude.  No severe pulmonary edema
 is present.
