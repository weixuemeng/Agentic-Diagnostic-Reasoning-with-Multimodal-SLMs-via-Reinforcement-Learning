                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall and head strike.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Prominence
 of the right mediastinal contour is again seen, previously attributed to a
 tortuous ascending aorta, and again accentuated by rightward patient rotation.
 The heart size is normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  Rectangular opacity over the anterior right second rib
 is similar to multiple prior exams.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
