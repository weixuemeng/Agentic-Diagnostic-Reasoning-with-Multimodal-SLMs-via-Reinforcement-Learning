                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  The already issued report issued is wrongly ascribed to this
 patient and should be ignored.
 
 CHEST: The endotracheal tube lies at the thoracic inlet.  The tip of the
 nasogastric tube lies within the stomach.  Diffuse airspace opacities are seen
 in both the right and left chest.  This could represent failure, but pneumonia
 would give this appearance also.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral alveolar infiltrates, pneumonia, or fluid overload.
