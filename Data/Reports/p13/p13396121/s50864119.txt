 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube insertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now
 well visible, but the tip is not included on the image.  The course of the
 tube is unremarkable.  The patient is still intubated.  The image shows signs
 of moderate pulmonary edema, combined to a mild left pleural effusion and
 subsequent atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be
 slightly enlarged.
