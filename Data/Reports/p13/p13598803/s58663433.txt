                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with emphysema and multiple aspergillomas, on
 chronic antifungals.  Assess for change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Appearance of the large cicatrices in the upper lungs has not changed since
 ___, with respect to extensive pleural thickening on the right and
 fluid retained in the cystic spaces, but the volume of mycetoma may have
 decreased.  On the left, there is no large mycetoma, no appreciable fluid or
 large scale pleural thickening, and there has been no change.  At the base of
 the left lung however there is now a cluster of irregular opacities which
 could represent airway dissemination of infection or purulent material.  There
 is no evidence of pneumonia elsewhere.  Severe hilar retraction is a
 longstanding feature but there are no changes in the contours of the central
 structures to suggest new adenopathy, or any change in the cardiac or vascular
 appearance to suggest cardiac decompensation.
