                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bronchiectasis, now with right chest
 pleurisy and increased sputum, history of aspergillosis, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased opacification in the right upper lung is suspicious for
 an acute infectious process with both frontal and lateral view revealing an
 air-fluid level which may reflect fluid in the pre-existing cavity, though the
 acuity of this finding is uncertain as an air fluid level may have been
 present on the prior.  The focal rounded opacity in the ___ study is not as
 well demonstrated on the current examination.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinum are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of right upper lung in the setting of
 known bilateral apical cavities/mycetomas is suspicious for recurrence of
 known aspergilus infection, though other pulmonary infections including
 pneumonia cannot be fully excluded. 
 
 Depending on clinical circumstance further assessment by CT can be obtained.
 
 This was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by
 phone.
