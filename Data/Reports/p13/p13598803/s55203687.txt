                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with emphysema and history of pneumonia, getting
 treatment for bilateral aspergilloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since
 ___, most recently ___:
 
 Severe retraction of the hila and cystic transformation in the lung apices is
 often seen with sarcoidosis.  The gross appearance of the bullous complex at
 the right apex is little changed.  Subtle changes in this region specifically
 would not be appreciated short of CT surveillance.  A new triangular opacity
 in the right lung projecting inferior to the right hilus and adjacent to the
 right heart border could be a mucoid impaction.  The other findings, primarily
 due to scarring and bronchiectasis in the upper lobes are grossly unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Severe generalized hyperinflation is stable.
