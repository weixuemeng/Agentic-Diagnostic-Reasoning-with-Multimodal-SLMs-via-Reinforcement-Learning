                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___F with recent pneumonia also with history of Aspergillus, now with shortness
 of breath and chest pain evaluate for pneumonia..
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple chest radiographs dating back to
 ___.
 TECHNIQUE
 Portable upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large cicatricial cysts in the lung apices, parenchymal scarring, and
 architectural distortion is similar to prior studies. However compared to
 prior studies there is increased radiodensity at both lung bases. Since There
 is blunting of the right costophrenic angle the abnormality on the right is a
 combination of consolidation and pleural effusion, probably the same on the
 left. A lateral view would be very helpful in assessing the contribution of
 pleural fluid. The heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Worsening bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely reflecting
 pneumonia and pleural effusions.
 2. Unchanged chronic parenchymal scarring, cicatricial cysts, and
 architectural distortion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr ___ by Dr. ___ ___ the
 telephone on ___ at 04:20
