 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. Chest
 CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large cicatricial cysts in the lung apices, parenchymal scarring and

 new material may have collected in one of the large cystic spaces, possible
 mycetoma.

 unchanged. The pulmonary artery is newly enlarged, elevated, and lobulated. 
 There is a new dense opacity in the left lower lobe and to a lesser extent at
 the right base.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is not enlarged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Worsening bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, may reflect
 pneumonia, possibly cryptogenic organizing pneumonia if patient has no
 clinical symptoms of pneumonia.
 2. Retracted hila and interval increase in caliber of the pulmonary artery
 suggests the patient may be prone to pulmonary hypertension save report
 3.  Possible mycetoma, chronicity indeterminate.
