                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with known emphysema,
 aspergillomas and recurrent pneumonias with recent lingular pneumonia,
 re-assessment.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is substantial interval decrease in the
 density in the lingular consolidation consistent with its gradual resolution. 
 Substantial distortion of the parenchyma in particular in the upper lungs  is
 re-demostrated with no substantial interval change or new areas of
 consolidation demonstrated.  There is also decrease in density in the right
 lower lung that might be consistent with decrease in the right middle lobe
 consolidation.  Bilateral breast prostheses projecting on both PA and lateral
 views.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
