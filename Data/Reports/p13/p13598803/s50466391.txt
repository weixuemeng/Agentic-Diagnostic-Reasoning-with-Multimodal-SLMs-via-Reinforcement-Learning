                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral aspergillosis and mycetomas. 
 Assess radiographic change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There may be some increase in the volume of fluid in the large right apical
 cavity containing at least one mycetoma.  Left apical cavity, though equally
 large, has a far thinner rim and no obvious contents.  Severe hilar retraction
 is an indication of longstanding scarring.  Frontal view suggests interval
 enlargement and greater wall thickening of a complex of saccular
 bronchiectasis or inflamed bullae in the right middle lobe.  Left lower lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Overall, findings suggest increased
 inflammation in both the middle lobe and the right apical cavity.
