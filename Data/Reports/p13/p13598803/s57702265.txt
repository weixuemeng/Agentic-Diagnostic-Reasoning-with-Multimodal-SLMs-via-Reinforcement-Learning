                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with COPD and multiple aspergillomas as well as
 recurrent lower respiratory infections.  Now has chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Compared to the most recent chest radiograph, the contents of both large upper
 lobe cystic spaces, the extent of right apical pleural thickening, and
 bronchiectasis and nodulation outside the left apical cavities have all
 improved over the past three months.  The cardiomediastinal contour, though
 obscured by the severely retracted hila, have not changed, and there is no
 pleural effusion.  In short, there is no radiographic explanation for chest
 pain and aspergilloma involvement in the upper lobe spaces is less pronounced.
