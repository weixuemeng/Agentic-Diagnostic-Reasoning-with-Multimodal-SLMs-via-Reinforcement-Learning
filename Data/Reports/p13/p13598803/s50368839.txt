                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, assess for acute infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___ as well as CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On a background of severe emphysema as well as biapical bulla and
 fibrotic changes including bronchiectasis, the latter suggestive of sarcoid,
 there is new left lower and mid lung ground-glass reticular opacification
 concerning for infection. Reticular pattern likely reflects underlying lung
 abnormality.  There is associated left hemidiaphragm elevation, probably
 largely due to a significantly distended stomach, though may be in small part
 explained by an element of inherent collapse within the left lung
 opacification. The appearance of luncency projecting over the proximal
 esophagus is likely due to apical bullae in a rotated patient, though
 esophageal dilatation is another consideration. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Background severe changes of emphysema and biapical fibrosis, the latter
 suggesting history of sarcoid, with a new left lung opacification concerning
 for pneumonia.
 2. Distended stomach of unclear etiology (attempted intubation, gastroparesis,
 etc.) as well as possible proximal esophageal dilatation; however, the latter
 is likely due to apical bullae in rotated patient.
 
 ___ discussed updated findings with Dr ___ at 8:01AM on ___ via
 telephone 5 minutes after interpretation.
