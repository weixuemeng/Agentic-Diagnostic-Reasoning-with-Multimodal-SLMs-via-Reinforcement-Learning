                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with invasive aspergillosis, decreased
 oxygen saturation post-bronchoscopy, patient with known large blebs.  Assess
 for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As compared with
 a CT scan from five days earlier, the areas of scarring in the bilateral upper
 lobes with known cavitation are essentially unchanged.  There is increased
 consolidation in the right lower lobe which is compatible with pneumonia. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  No large effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Bony structures remain intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Stable scarring and cavitation in the upper
 lobes.  Slight increase in right lower lobe opacity concerning for slight
 progression of pneumonia.
