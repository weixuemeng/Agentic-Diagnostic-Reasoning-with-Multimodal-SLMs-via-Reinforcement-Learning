                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fall, possible syncope, with a history of
 pacemaker and defibrillator.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Dual lead pacemaker device overlying the left
 hemithorax has leads  in appropriate position in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  An additional abandoned lead is identified within the right
 ventricle.  The aorta appears tortuous.  Borderline cardiomegaly is present.
 Interstitial nodularity within the left lung is concerning for metastatic
 lymphangitic spread of carcinoma in the correct clinical setting. Hazy
 opacification along the right mid lung may represent pleural effusion. An
 avascular lucency surrounded by a slightly dense curvilinear margin within the
 right lower lung base may may represent air and fluid within the pleural
 space.  Pleural plaques are noted bilaterally. Dense osseous lesions in the
 vertebral bodies may represent blastic metastasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Interstitial nodularity within left lung may suggest metastatic
 lymphangitic spread of carcinoma; correlate with patient's clinical history. 
 2. Dense osseous lesions in vertebral bodies are also concerning for blastic
 metastases.
 3. Avascular lucency surrounded by a slightly dense curvilinear margin within
 the right lower lung base may may represent air and fluid within the pleural
 space.
