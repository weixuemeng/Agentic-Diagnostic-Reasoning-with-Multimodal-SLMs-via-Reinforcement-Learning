                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known thoracic aortic aneurysm with chest and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and reference chest CT ___ at 15:52.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dilatation of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta is
 compatible with known aortic aneurysm, better assessed on the prior CT.  The
 heart size is normal.  Hilar contours are normal.  Linear atelectasis in the
 left lower lobe is present.  No focal consolidation is identified.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle on the lateral view is compatible with a small
 pleural effusion, seen on the prior CT.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is seen. Clips are seen within the neck.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Thoracic aortic aneurysm, better assessed on the prior reference
 CT, with small left pleural effusion.  Left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
