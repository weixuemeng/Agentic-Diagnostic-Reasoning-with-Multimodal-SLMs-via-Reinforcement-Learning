                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Disseminated zoster and chest pain, tenderness to palpation on
 the left side of the rib cage.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly occurred
 area of atelectatic changes at the left lung base and in the retrocardiac lung
 areas.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus has newly appeared,
 potentially caused by a minimal left pleural effusion.  The visible parts of
 the ribs, however, appear unremarkable.
 
 Overall, the lung volumes have substantially decreased.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Unchanged evidence of the known aortic
 stent.  No pneumothorax.
