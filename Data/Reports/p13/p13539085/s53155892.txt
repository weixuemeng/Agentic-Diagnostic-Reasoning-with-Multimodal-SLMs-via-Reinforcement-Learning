                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with past smoking history and a subacute cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality in the lung bases may be an indication of
 chronic tobacco use.  It is probably not an acute finding.  There is no
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces
 are normal.
