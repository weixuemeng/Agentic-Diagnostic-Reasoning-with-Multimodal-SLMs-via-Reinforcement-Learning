                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, shortness of breath, and fevers,
 evaluate for pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Accounting for technique, the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. 
 The mediastinal contours are unchanged and appear normal.  Slight deformity of
 the right distal clavicle may relate to prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
