 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F postop day 3 status right colectomy, now with fever,
 confusion, lethargic
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is bibasilar consolidation.  Compared to prior study from earlier today,
 the right base consolidation appears worse and the left base consolidation has
 improved.  Given their rapid fluctuations, aspiration pneumonia is the likely
 etiology. Bronchial wall thickening is noted in the right mid lung, also in
 congruent with aspiration pneumonia. There is a small pleural effusion. Heart
 is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Mildly dilated
 loops of bowel are seen in the left upper quadrant. There is no
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___, RN On the
 telephone on ___ at 9:59 AM, 5 minutes after the images were reviewed.
