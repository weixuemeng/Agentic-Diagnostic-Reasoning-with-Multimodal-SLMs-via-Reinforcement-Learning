                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute change in mental status in a patient status post right
 colectomy, with fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with
 increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis.  A retrocardiac opacity is again seen and
 probably unchanged compared to the prior radiograph, again possibly
 representing atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. A
 retrocardiac opacity is redemonstrated, likely unchanged compared to the prior
 exam. This again may represent atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
