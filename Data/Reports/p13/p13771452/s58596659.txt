                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumomediastinum on CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is progressive
 decrease in the subcutaneous gas in the right supraclavicular and neck
 regions.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Some increasing
 opacification at the right base laterally raises the possibility of aspiration
 or supervening pneumonia.  Lines simulating pleural stripe overlying the upper
 left chest has vessels going beyond it and therefore does not represent a
 pneumothorax.
 
 No definite gas is seen within the mediastinum.  However, CT is much more
 sensitive for this determination and would be necessary to definitely exclude
 this possibility.
