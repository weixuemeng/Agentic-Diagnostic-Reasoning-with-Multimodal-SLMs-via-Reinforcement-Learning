                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: ___ year old woman with productive cough, fever and tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show no change in the slightly
 blunted appearance of the left costophrenic angle laterally which appears to
 be related to scarring when viewed in conjunction with the lateral view. 
 There is stable minimal biapical pleural thickening and slight uncoiling of
 the thoracic aorta.  The lungs are clear, and the heart and mediastinal
 contours show no suspicious change compared to the most recent prior study of
 ___.  Well-corticated calcification projecting inferiorly to the
 distal left clavicle may be post-traumatic.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pneumonia seen.
