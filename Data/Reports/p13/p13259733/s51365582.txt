                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy opacity in the left
 lung base likely reflects a small pleural effusion and possibly atelectasis in
 the adjacent lung, though infection is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax
 is seen. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar patchy opacity likely reflects a combination of a small left
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.
