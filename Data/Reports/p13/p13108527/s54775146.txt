                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left sided chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 otherwise the hilar mediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs demonstrate
 diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominately in the left perihilar
 region.  There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 Left-sided pacer device is seen with leads in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, predominantly left perihilar region may be secondary to pulmonary
 edema.
 2.  No rib fractures detected, though this technique is limited in sensitivity
 for osseous trauma.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
