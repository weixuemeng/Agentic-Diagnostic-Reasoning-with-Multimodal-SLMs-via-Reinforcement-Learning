                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and congestive failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. The heart
 appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified to a mild
 degree.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged
 allowing for differences in technique.  A left pleural effusion and basilar
 opacification have resolved.  There is a probable a small right-sided pleural
 effusion with vague posterior basilar opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small pleural effusion on the right with vague posterior basilar opacity,
 although probably compatible with atelectasis.  Correlation with clinical
 presentation is recommended, however, regarding any potential concern for
 infection.
