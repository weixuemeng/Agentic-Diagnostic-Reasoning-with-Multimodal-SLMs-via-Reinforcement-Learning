 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  The right PICC line
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction in the left jugular catheter terminates
 at the right atrium.  When compared to the most recent study there is apparent
 opacification of the lower left lung that likely represents superimposed soft
 tissue.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  There is a small bilateral lucencies underneath the diaphragm that is
 consistent with intraperitoneal air and is compatible with recent gastrostomy
 tube placement.
