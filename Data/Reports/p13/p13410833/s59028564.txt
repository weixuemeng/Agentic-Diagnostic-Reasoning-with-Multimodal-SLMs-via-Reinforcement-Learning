 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is head median sternotomy and CABG. Sternal wires are intact. The
 lungs are hyperinflated but clear without consolidation or pulmonary edema. 
 On the frontal view, the left costal pleural margin is widened, more likely
 pleural thickening than effusion. On the lateral view widening of the
 retrosternal soft tissue is probably organized postoperative mediastinal
 fluid. Cardiomegaly is mild.

 these can be compared with prior chest radiographs to assure that the findings
 are chronic.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly .
