                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increasing confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Minimal linear density in the left
 lower lung likely represents plate-like atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
