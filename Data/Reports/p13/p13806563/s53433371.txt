                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There are mild congestive changes
 bilaterally.  There is somewhat more prominent opacity in the right lower lung
 than elsewhere but this is suspected to be due to low lung volumes and mild
 fluid overload with doubt concerning development of pneumonia.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  If there is substantial
 clinical concern for pneumonia then short-term follow-up radiographs could be
 considered, however, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if feasible.
