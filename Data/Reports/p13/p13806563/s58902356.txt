                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable frontal views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Initial image demonstrates left mainstem bronchus intubation. Subsequent image
 demonstrates endotracheal tube in place with tip 3.3 cm cranial to the carina.
 Initial image demonstrated complete collapse of the right lung though
 subsequent image demonstrates partial atelectatic collapse of the right lung
 with improving aeration.  Left lung remains essentially clear. Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left hilar contour is normal. Right hilar contour
 cannot be evaluated. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Final image demonstrates appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube with
 improved aeration of the right lung which was previously collapsed due to left
 mainstem intubation.
