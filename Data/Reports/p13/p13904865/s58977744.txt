 Eval for acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is some
 increase in pulmonary venous pressure.  Prominent layering pleural effusions
 bilaterally, worse on the left, with compressive basilar atelectasis.  In view
 of the extensive pulmonary changes, it is impossible to exclude the
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral
 view.
 Dual channel pacer device is in place with leads extending to the right atrium
 and apex of the right ventricle.
