                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Complex medical history including renal transplant, past
 diagnosis of LVOT with recent cough and question of reactive airway secondary
 to viral infection. Earlier chest x-ray showed small pleural effusion.  Please
 evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate
 well-expanded lungs bilaterally.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings
 most notable at the lower lungs suggesting chronic interstitial lung disease,
 have not significantly changed, and there is no focal area of consolidation. 
 Heart is normal in size.  Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.  A
 cardiac stent is identified on the lateral view.  Mild blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle has not significantly changed over multiple prior studies,
 suggesting a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Stable small right pleural effusion.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia
