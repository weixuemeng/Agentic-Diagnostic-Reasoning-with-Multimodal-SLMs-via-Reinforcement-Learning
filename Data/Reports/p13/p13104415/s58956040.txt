                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonia in a patient with leukocytosis,
 elevated lactate, and risk for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, as well as CT abdomen/pelvis from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  A small hiatal hernia is better
 seen in prior abdomen CT. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  Linear opacity in the right lower lung is compatible with
 atelectasis.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Right lower lung atelectasis.
