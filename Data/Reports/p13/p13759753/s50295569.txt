                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chronic weakness, past pleural effusions
 associated with rib fracture, mild LVH  // ? persistent pleural effusions or
 CHF     CHRONIC WEAKNESS,PT STATES CHEST PAIN,PAST PLEURAL EFFUSIONS
 ASSOCIATED WITH RIB FX,MILD LVH R/O PERSISTENT PLEURAL EFFUSIONS VS
 CHF,ABNORMALITY
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Base of the left lung is more substantially elevated, at least in part by
 subpulmonic pleural effusion.  If that is the only explanation then the
 effusion is substantially larger today than it was on ___.  There is also
 the possibility of subphrenic mass effect, particularly since the stomach
 bubble is markedly attenuated.  Left upper quadrant ultrasound would be
 helpful in excluding the subdiaphragmatic pathology.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  Subpulmonic right pleural effusion is small.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 long-standing.  No pneumothorax.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Left upper quadrant and diaphragmatic ultrasound appear
