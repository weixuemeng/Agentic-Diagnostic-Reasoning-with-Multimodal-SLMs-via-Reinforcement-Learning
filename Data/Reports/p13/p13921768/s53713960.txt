                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe COPD with dyspnea, to assess for acute pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 better inspiration.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some
 evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though less prominent than on
 the previous study.  Intact midline sternal wires are seen in a patient with
 previous CABG procedure and a dual-channel pacemaker in place.  Axial clips
 are again seen.
 
 Some mild atelectatic changes and possible small effusions are seen at the
 bases, as on prior study.
