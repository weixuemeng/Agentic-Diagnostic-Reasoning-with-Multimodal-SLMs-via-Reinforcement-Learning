                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB/CHF  // r/o pulm edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP view of the chest provided.
 
 A right atrioventricular pacemaker appears unchanged.
 
 The right lung is hypoinflated in relation to the left lung. There is mild
 vascular congestion consistent with fluid overload.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions are seen with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Hilar contours are normal.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 Severe S-shaped is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. There is mild vascular congestion consistent with mild fluid overload.
 
 2.  Opacification of the right upper lung could be due to asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, scapula projecting over the lung or in the appropriate clinical setting
 pneumonia.
 
 3. Small, bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
