  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the main pulmonary artery, and likely not
  advanced enough to get a proper wedge pressure.  ___ were d/w Dr. ___
  by Dr. ___ by phone at ___:___p on the day of the exam by phone.
  No pneumothorax.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared
  to the prior study.  Small more focal consolidation at the right lung base may
  indicate aspiration or pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent
  atelectasis.  Persistent moderate enlarged of the cardiac silhouette.   Right
  internal jugular line with tip in the proximal SVC.

 today, conceivably combination of dependent edema and atelectasis. Left lower
 lobe became consolidated on ___, presumably atelectasis.
