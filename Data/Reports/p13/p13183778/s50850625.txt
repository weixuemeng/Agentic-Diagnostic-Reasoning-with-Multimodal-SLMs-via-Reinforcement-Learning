                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacer replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 dual-channel pacer device with leads in the region of the right atrium and
 apex of the right ventricle.  Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and
 there is no evidence of vascular congestion, a combination that raises the
 possibility of cardiomyopathy.  No acute focal pneumonia.
