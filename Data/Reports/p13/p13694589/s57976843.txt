 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a 9 mm rounded density in the
 right lower lung zone which is most likely the nipple, although an underlying
 nodule cannot be excluded.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 small pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat chest radiographs
 with nipple markers.
