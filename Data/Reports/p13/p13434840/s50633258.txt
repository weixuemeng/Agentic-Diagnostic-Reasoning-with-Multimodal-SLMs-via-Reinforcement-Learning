                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube ends 1.2 cm above the level of the carina.  There is a
 right-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and right ventricular
 leads.  A right internal jugular venous catheter is seen, containing an
 additional pacer wire that ends over the region of the right ventricle.  There
 is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is likely a small left pleural
 effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Aortic knob calcifications are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  ET tube ends 1.2 cm above the level of the carina and should be retracted
 by approximately 3 cm for more optimal position.
 
 3.  Small left pleural effusion.
 
 Findings and recommendation were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ telephone at 5:00 p.m. on the day of the study.
