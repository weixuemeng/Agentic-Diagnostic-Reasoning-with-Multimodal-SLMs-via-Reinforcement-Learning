                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart block with pacemaker placement complicated by RV lead
 perforation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the new right ventricular lead
 appears to be in good position, substantially less peripheral than on the
 previous study.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2 cm above the
 carina.  Small layering pleural effusion persists on the left and there is
 mild bilateral basilar atelectasis.
