 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to chest radiograph from 1 day prior, increasing opacity in the

 atelectasis.  On the lateral view, the pleural fluid has the very horizontal
 appearance, suggestive of hydro pneumothorax.  A pleural line is not
 visualized on the AP view.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight increase in left-sided hemothorax, with air-fluid level on the lateral
 concerning for hydro pneumothorax.
