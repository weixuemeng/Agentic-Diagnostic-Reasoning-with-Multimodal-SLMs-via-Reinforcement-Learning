                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations and pre-syncope, evaluate for acute intrathoracic
 process.

 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Lungs are clear.  Hyperdense rounded
 opacity in the apical portion of the left lung projecting over the left
 clavicle is of unclear etiology.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax

 IMPRESSION:  Round density rpojects over the left apex, slightly increased in
 conspicuity - recommend nonemergent CT to assess further.
