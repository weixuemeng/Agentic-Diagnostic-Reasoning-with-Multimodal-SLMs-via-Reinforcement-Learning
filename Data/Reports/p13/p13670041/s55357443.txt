 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fall one week ago
 with subsequent development of left lateral back pain with movement as well as
 anterior left chest pain with deep inspiration, question left rib fractures or
 spine fractures.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
