 Assess for interval change. Please time for 05:00 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung
 volumes.  Right chest tube remains in place and there is minimal if any
 residual pneumothorax.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles could reflect
 small pleural effusions, though they may merely be a manifestation of low lung
 volumes.  Little if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and no evidence
 of acute focal pneumonia.
