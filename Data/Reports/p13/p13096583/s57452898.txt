                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia after cervical spine injury.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, increased from the
 prior study from the day before and raising suspicion for aspiration. 
 However, an overlying infectious process cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are without a new focal consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette appears
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, increased in comparison to the
 prior study from the day before and raising suspicion for aspiration.  An
 overlying infectious process must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
