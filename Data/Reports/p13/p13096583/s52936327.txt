                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  New fever. Recent admission for trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Trace pleural effusions are suspected due to slight blunting of each
 costophrenic sulcus.  Minor streaky left lower lung opacification suggests
 minor atelectasis.  The patient is status post incompletely characterized
 cervical fusion.  Asymmetrical widening of the right acromioclavicular joint
 is noted similar to films at presentation.  
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Streaky left basilar opacification suggesting atelectasis; findings are
 not particularly suspicious for pneumonia; however, follow-up radiographs
 could be considered if unexplained fever or pulmonary symptoms were to
 persist.   
 
 2.  Asymmetrical widening of the right acromioclavicular joint with no recent
 change although of uncertain chronicity otherwise; correlation with physical
 findings and mechanism of trauma suggested.
