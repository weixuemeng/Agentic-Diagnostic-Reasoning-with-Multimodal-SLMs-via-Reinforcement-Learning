                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of myeloma, weight loss, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly occurred
 right lower lobe opacity with peribronchial predominance and air bronchograms.
 Moreover, the right hilus is slightly bigger than at the previous examination
 and could be displaced towards the lung bases.  Overall, these findings
 suggest a volume losing process in the right lower lung, potentially a
 combination of hilar adenopathy and atelectasis or a chronic infection with
 reactive atelectatic changes.  In any way, CT appears to be indicated.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal range.  No pleural
 effusions.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 4:31 p.m., on ___, the referring physician, ___. ___ was paged for notification.
 Finings were discussed on the telephone a few minutes later.
