                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant.  Evaluate for worsening pleural
 effusion or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 5.4 cm above
 the carina.  The right internal jugular introducer and left internal jugular
 catheter end in the upper SVC.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the pulmonary
 outflow tract.  Two surgical drains project over the right upper quadrant.  A
 Dobhoff tube ends in the stomach, the superior part of which is coiled,
 projecting over the hypopharynx.  Compared to ___, right pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis are similar, with mediastinal shift to the
 right, suggesting atelectasis exceeds the effusion.  No left effusion and no
 large pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Coiling of the Dobhoff tube at the level of the hypopharynx. It is unclear
 if this is within or external to the patient. Per discussion with Dr. ___
 ___ by phone at 11:06am on ___, the team has already removed the
 tube.
 2.  Right pleural effusion and atelectasis unchanged from ___.
