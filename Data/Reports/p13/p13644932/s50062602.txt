                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in technique and projection, there has
 been little change in the appearance of the chest.  Apparent slight decrease
 in pleural effusions could potentially be related to differences in
 positioning between the exams.
