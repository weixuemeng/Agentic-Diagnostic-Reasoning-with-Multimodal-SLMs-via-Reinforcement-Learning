                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:02
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post liver transplant with recent
 Dobbhoff tube placement and check advancement of the endotracheal tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 6:47.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:02 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 7 cm above the carina
 and should still be advanced an additional 2 cm.  The left internal jugular
 central line and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  A catheter in the right upper quadrant is again seen. 
 There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which on the
 initial image is coiled in the mid esophagus but subsequently has been
 repositioned and now projects over the stomach.  Opacity persists at the right
 lung base suggestive of atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  No
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No large effusions.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient
 positioning.  Results were communicated to the covering nurse, ___, by
 phone on ___ at 11:23 a.m. at the time of discovery.
