                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
 Increased opacification at the right base again most likely reflects pleural
 effusion with underlying atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
