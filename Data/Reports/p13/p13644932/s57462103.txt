                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma status post liver
 transplant.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz
 catheter, right upper central venous catheter, and nasoenteric catheter are in
 expected unchanged position.  There is new severe left lower lobe opacity,
 likely a combination of interval atelectasis and a moderate-to-large effusion.
 Overall increased density of the bilateral lungs and central vascular
 enlargement suggests interval development of new mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard position of support devices.
 2.  Probable new left lower lobe collapse with associated moderate-to-severe
 effusion.
 3.  Probable new mild-to-moderate edema
