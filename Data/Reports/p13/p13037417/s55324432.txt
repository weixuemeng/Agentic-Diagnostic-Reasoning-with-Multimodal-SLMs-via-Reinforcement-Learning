                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with restrained MVA three days ago, with
 moderate lower back and chest pain x2 days.
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No
