                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o pancreatitis expressing new
 significant pain and vomiting  // ? air under diaphragm     ? air under
 diaphragm
 
 COMPARISON:
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 15 44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 18 54 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid to distal
 SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Streaky
 opacities at both bases may reflect atelectasis or scarring, less likely
 superimposed infection. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No free intraperitoneal air.  No large
 effusions. Subtle deformity of the right posterior lateral eighth rib likely
 reflecting old trauma.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
