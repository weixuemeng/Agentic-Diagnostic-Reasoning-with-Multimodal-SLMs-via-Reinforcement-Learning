  folded upon itself with the catheter coursing back up from the stomach -
  terminating in the mid esophagus - correlate clinically.  Diffuse bilateral
  alveolar opacities are non-specific in appearance.  Findings may reflect
  severe alveolar pulmonary edema or severe pneumonia.  Probable small
  effusions.  Mediastinal structures difficult to assess given the diffuse

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:48 P.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  New PIC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 New right PIC line passes to the mid SVC, where the tip is partially obscured
 by a nasogastric tube that is looped in the stomach and ends at the level of
 the carina in the esophagus.  Nasogastric tube was removed on subsequent
 radiograph available at the time of this dictation, so I made no attempt at
 position verification.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged.  Lungs are filled with multiple nodules and
 moderately severe pulmonary edema and/or consolidation.  Right pleural
 effusion is small.  No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
