                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is subtle increase in bibasilar opacities, suggestive of
 increased pleural effusions and mildly increased interstitial edema.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Heart and mediastinum appear stable with mild
 cardiomegaly.  Right internal jugular catheter appears to be in similar
 position given differences in patient positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased pleural effusions, left greater than right,
 with persistent moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
