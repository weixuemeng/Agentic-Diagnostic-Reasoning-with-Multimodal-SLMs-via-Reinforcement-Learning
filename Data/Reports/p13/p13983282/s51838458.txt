                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Weight gain.  Question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a persistent and perhaps somewhat increased pattern of
 hazy lung opacification and prominent reticular markings suggesting moderate
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Pleural effusions are not excluded and a
 right-sided pleural effusion may be suspected based on slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting similar to perhaps somewhat increased
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
