                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CHF exacerbation and pulmonary nodules.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is stable.  Now mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or increasing pleural effusions.  The
 pleural effusions are small and bilateral.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities, lung nodules are not  appreciated, and continued followup is
 recommended until resolution of acute findings of CHF.
