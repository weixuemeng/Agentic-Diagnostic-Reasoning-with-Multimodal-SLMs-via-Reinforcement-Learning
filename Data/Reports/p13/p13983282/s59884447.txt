                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CAD/CHF, DM, CKD, PAD, presenting with acute
 N/V, weakness, with preceding URI symptoms, SOB.  // Please assess for
 intrapulmonary process/vascular congestion, evidence of acute heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal contours are unchanged
 with a moderate hiatal hernia again noted. Minimal atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen at the aortic knob. Moderate pulmonary edema is
 present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness.  There are likely
 trace bilateral pleural effusions, with a small amount of fluid seen tracking
 in the minor fissure.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with probable trace bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
