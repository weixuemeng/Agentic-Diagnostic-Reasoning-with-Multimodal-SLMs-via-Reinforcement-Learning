                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yr. old woman  with PMH of HTN, CAD S/P MI ___, ischemic
 cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF (EF ___%), DMII (dx ___, C/B neuropathy,
 retinopathy, nephropathy, gastroparesis), CKD stage III s/p cardiogenic shock
 c/b by shock liver and likely ATN, now on the floor, undergoing diuresis.  //
 Please assess for interval change, evidence of volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. The nasogastric tube extends into the
 stomach, distal tip not visualized. A right-sided PICC line extends into the
 low right atrium.  Retraction by 7-8 cm would position its tip in the low SVC.
 There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac airspace opacification has decreased,
 likely due to resolved atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size
 is smaller, but magnified by the projection.  A moderate hiatal hernia is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided PICC line terminates in the right atrium. Retraction by 7-8 cm
 would reposition the tip in the low SVC.
 
 Resolved left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 Moderate hiatal hernia.
