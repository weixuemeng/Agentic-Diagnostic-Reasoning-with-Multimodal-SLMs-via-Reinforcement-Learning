 Previous median sternotomy noted.  The patient has been extubated since the
 prior study and a Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  A trauma line in the
 right internal jugular terminates in the proximal SVC.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion persists.  Airspace opacity at the right lung base likely
 reflects resolving pulmonary edema as this has improved when compared to the
 prior study, however infection cannot be excluded.  Similar appearance of the
 left lung base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared to the
 prior study.
