 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough pls eval pna  // History: ___M with cough

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, right greater
 than left, worrisome for moderate to severe pulmonary edema; however, given
 clinical history, findings could be due to severe atypical pneumonia.  On the
 lateral view, in addition to the aforementioned interstitial opacities, there
 is basilar consolidation posteriorly.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG as well as what appears to be in aortic valve replacement,
 although appears slightly superior in position for such.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, right greater than
 left, could be due to severe pulmonary edema versus severe atypical pneumonia.
 In addition, on the lateral view, posterior basilar opacity is worrisome for
 consolidation
