                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, AP view.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
 graft surgery.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Linear opacities projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis
 or scarring.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion.  There is a pleural
 line projecting over the left lung apex, probably a rib edge or companion
 shadow rather than a pneumothorax but not well delineated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacity at the left apex, probably a rib edge or companion
 shadow but noting an overlapping EKG lead partly obscuring the area,
 short-term followup with radiographs including repositioning of the lead, and
 potentially PA and lateral technique if possible, are suggested.
