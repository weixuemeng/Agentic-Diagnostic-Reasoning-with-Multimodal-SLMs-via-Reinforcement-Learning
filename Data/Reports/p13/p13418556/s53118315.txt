                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 Bibasilar consolidations appear to be unchanged, associated with small amount
 of pleural effusion.  Minimal amount of intraperitoneal air appears to be
 decreased since the prior study.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There
 is no definitive evidence of infection in the lung bases and the appearance is
 most likely consistent with atelectasis, but continued surveillance is
 recommended.
