                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung cancer, COPD presents with dyspnea,
 malaise, low grade fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 enlargement of the pulmonary artery again suggestive of underlying pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again demonstrated.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle appears unchanged, compatible with chronic pleural
 thickening.  Chain sutures from prior wedge resections in the right lung are
 re- demonstrated.  Patchy and streaky opacities are seen in the lung bases,
 more pronounced compared to the prior chest radiograph, which may reflect
 atelectasis but bronchial inflammation may be present, as was demonstrated on
 the prior CT.  No focal consolidation, new pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Increased streaky and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 bronchial inflammation, as seen on the prior CT.  No focal consolidation.
 2. Emphysema and enlargement of the pulmonary artery suggestive of chronic
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
