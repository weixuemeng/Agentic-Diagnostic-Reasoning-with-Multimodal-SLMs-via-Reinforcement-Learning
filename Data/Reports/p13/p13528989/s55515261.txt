                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Minimally increased opacification is
 noted within the retrocardiac space, particularly evident on the lateral view.
 Finding may be related to atelectasis exaggerated by slightly low lung
 volumes, though cannot exclude developing infectious process.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimally increased opacification of retrocardiac space may
 represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No overt pulmonary edema.
