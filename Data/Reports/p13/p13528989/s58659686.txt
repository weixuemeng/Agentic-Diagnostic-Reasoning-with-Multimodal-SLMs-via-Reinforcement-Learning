 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic prostate cancer, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in visibility of the interstitial lung structures, likely reflecting increased
 interstitial fluid load.  The pleural effusions and the bilateral areas of
 atelectasis are unchanged in extent and severity.  No new parenchymal opacity
 suggesting pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumothorax.
