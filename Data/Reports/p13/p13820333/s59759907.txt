                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Myelofibrosis with stem cell transplant, now with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Intact midline sternal wires are again seen, though there is no
 evidence of cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
 focal pneumonia.  The elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is no longer
 appreciated.  Medial displacement of the stomach again would be consistent
 with splenomegaly.
