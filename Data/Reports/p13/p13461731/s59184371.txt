                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of interstitial lung disease with shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CTA chest, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality, more severe in the
 right lung than the left, is similar in appearance to the prior radiograph. 
 The abnormality is similarly to perhaps slightly more prominent that the prior
 study, although this may be due to the difference in the penetration of the
 image.  These abnormalities are likely for the most part due to the patient's
 underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is no definite evidence
 of pulmonary edema, although small component of new pulmonary edema cannot be
 fully excluded given the very abnormal underlying lung.  No focal
 consolidation is present.  No definite pleural effusions are present.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Asymmetric interstitial lung disease appears similar to perhaps slightly
 worsened in comparison to prior radiographs.
 2.  No definite evidence of pulmonary edema, although the possibility of mild
 superimposed edema in the background of pre-existing lung disease is difficult
 to completely exclude.
 3.  No definite pneumonia.
