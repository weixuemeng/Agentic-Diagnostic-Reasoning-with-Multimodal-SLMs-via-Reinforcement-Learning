                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Congestive heart failure, pneumonia, infarct.
 
 COMPARISONS: ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 Findings: There is a moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality, although
 somewhat asymmetric, being more prominent in the right mid-to-upper lung than
 left.  However, this appearance is quite similar to prior radiographs, which
 were also performed with similar technique, suggesting that the etiology is an
 underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms.  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with findings suggesting
 underlying interstitial lung disease without definite superimposed acute
 process.
