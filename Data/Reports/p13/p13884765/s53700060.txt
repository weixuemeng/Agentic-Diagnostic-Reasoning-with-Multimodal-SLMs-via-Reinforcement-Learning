                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of throat swelling,
 voice changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 mildly enlarged.  There is persistent mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 The aorta remains calcified and tortuous.  Degenerative changes at the
 shoulder joints are again seen.  The left shoulder is not well evaluated,
 although calcification along the superior humeral head could relate to
 calcific bursitis/tendinosis, loose bodies cannot be excluded on this study.
