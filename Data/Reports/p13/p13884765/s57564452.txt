 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 with bibasilar atelectasis, as well as a more linear area of atelectasis in
 the posterior left lower lobe.  A pleural effusion is present on the left. 
 The heart size is top normal, with median sternotomy wires and mediastinal
 clips, unchanged from the prior study.  Peribronchial cuffing and bilateral
 interstitial prominence is increased since the prior study, compatible with
 mild pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is
