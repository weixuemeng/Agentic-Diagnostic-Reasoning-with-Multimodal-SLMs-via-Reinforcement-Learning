                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A subtle
 area of increased opacity is present in the right infrahilar region, with
 otherwise grossly clear lungs.  There are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific patchy right infrahilar opacity, which may be due to
 patchy atelectasis, focal aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia. 
 Short-term followup radiographs are suggested to assess for resolution.
