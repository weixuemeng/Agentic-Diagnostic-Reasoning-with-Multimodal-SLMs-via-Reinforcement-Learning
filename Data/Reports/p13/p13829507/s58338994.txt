                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after repeated vomiting, here to evaluate for evidence of
 pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
