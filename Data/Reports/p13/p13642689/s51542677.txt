                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with thorocoabdominal aorta repair  // r/o ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 17 35 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extreme right lung apex excluded from the film.  Allowing for this, no
 pneumothorax is detected.  Pleural fluid is again seen extending along the
 left lung apex, probably similar in extent, allowing for differences in
 positioning.
 
 The tip of the ET tube is not well delineated, but it probably lies
 approximately 8.7 cm above the carina, immediately below the level of the
 clavicular heads.  NG type tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off
 film.  Right IJ central line --___ Swan-Ganz catheter --___ tip again
 noted in the region of the RV outflow tract --___ correlation requested. 
 Left subclavian PICC line tip over proximal/mid SVC.  Surgical ___ noted
 over the left chest.  Subcutaneous emphysema is noted adjacent to the lower
 left chest wall.  A linear density seen near the subcutaneous emphysema at the
 left chest base is of uncertain etiology or significance.  No left-sided chest
 tube is identified.
 
 Extensive vascular plethora, diffuse vascular blurring, and some areas of
 confluent opacity are again noted in both lungs, similar to the prior study. 
 Cardiac opacity also similar to the prior study.  Right costophrenic angle
 excluded from the film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Extreme right lung apex excluded from the film.  Allowing for this, no
 pneumothorax is detected.  Left apical pleural fluid again noted, similar to
 prior.
 2. Extensive interstitial and some alveolar opacities and retrocardiac opacity
 is similar to the prior film.  This could reflect CHF with pulmonary edema. 
 Possibility of an underlying pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
 3. No left-sided chest tube visualized.  Clinical correlation is requested.
 4. Right IJ line --___ Swan-Ganz catheter.  Please see comment above.
