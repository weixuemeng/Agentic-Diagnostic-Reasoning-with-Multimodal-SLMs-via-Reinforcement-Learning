 likely overlies the gastric fundus.  An additional NG type tube is present,
 also with tip overlying the gastric fundus.
 
 Incidental note is made of radiopaque material overlying lower left chest
 laterally, not fully characterized.  This does not clearly have purchase in
 bone.  Clinical correlation is requested.
