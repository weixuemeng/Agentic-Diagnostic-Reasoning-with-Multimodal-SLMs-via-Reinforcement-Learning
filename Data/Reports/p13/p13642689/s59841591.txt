                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new sided SubC air  // eval for ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs performed on the same day on ___
 at 07:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs performed on the same day on ___
 at 07:34, there is increased asymmetric opacification of both lungs, right
 greater than left, which may could be asymmetric pulmonary edema, and/or
 concurrent consolidation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Severe mediastinal widening is unchanged since earlier in the day, improved
 since ___.  .  An ET tube ends 7 cm above the carina, and should be
 advanced 2-3 cm for more secure positioning.  A right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminates in the right pulmonary artery.  Two left pleural drains are stable
 in position.  Small left pleural effusion is likely.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New moderate, asymmetric pulmonary edema and possible concurrent right
 lung pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 2.  ET tube 2-3 cm above standard position.
 3.  No pneumothorax.
 
 4.  Stable severe postoperative cardiomediastinal widening, presumably
 hematoma.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 4:05 PM, 30 minutes after discovery
 of the findings.
