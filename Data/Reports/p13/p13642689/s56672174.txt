                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic dissection, rule out CHF.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.  There is marked
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.  There is increased retrocardiac
 density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No
 gross effusion, but the possibility of small effusions cannot be excluded. 
 Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 2.  Increased vascular plethora and increased interstitial markings, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect CHF.
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 4.  Left-greater-than-right effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 5.  The status of the aorta cannot be conclusively evaluated on this film.
