                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // eval for left effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 08:___ at
 20:59.  The films from earlier ___ are difficult to compare due to small
 fields of view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___ at 20:59, the overall appearance is similar.
 
 Again seen is a rind of pleural fluid and/or thickening about the left lung,
 with collapse and/or consolidation at the left lung base.  Possibility of
 slight interval increase in the degree of left-sided pleural fluid cannot be
 entirely excluded.  The degree of opacity within the aerated portion of left
 lung appears slightly increased.
 
 The appearance of the right lung, with diffuse vascular plethora and prominent
 right hilum, is probably similar, allowing for technical differences.
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 7.2 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip overlies
 the gastric fundus.  A left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal
 SVC.  A right IJ central right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is similar in
 configuration, with tip suspected to be in the region of the right ventricular
 outflow tract.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite change compared with ___.  The possibility of slight
 increase in the left pleural effusion as well as increased opacities in the
 left mid zone cannot be excluded.
 
 Appearances in the right and left lung are most suggestive of CHF with
 interstitial and alveolar edema.  The possibility of an underlying infectious
 infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
