  1. Overall picture is consistent with worsening pulmonary edema, with likely
  an enlarging left pleural effusion.
  2. Endotracheal tube remains approximately 7.3 cm above the carina.
  3. Left subclavian line terminates at the distal brachiocephalic vein.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with L subclavian CVL  // L subclavian CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 21:02, CTA torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderately severe pulmonary edema.  In comparison to the prior study
 performed 1 hour earlier, there is increasing opacification of the left
 hemithorax which may be due to a combination of layering pleural effusion and
 pulmonary edema.  A moderate/large left pleural effusion also appears to be
 slightly increased.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.
 
 There has been interval placement of a left subclavian line which terminates
 in the brachiocephalic vein.  Endotracheal tube is again noted to terminate
 approximately 7.3 cm above the carina.  Inferior tip of the enteric tube is
 not visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Overall picture is consistent with worsening pulmonary edema, with likely
 an enlarging left pleural effusion.
 2. Endotracheal tube remains approximately 7.3 cm above the carina.
 3. Left subclavian line terminates at the distal brachiocephalic vein.
