                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:40 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and new
 delirium, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests mild cardiac
 decompensation.  Greater opacification at the lung bases is most likely
 atelectasis, particularly given the downward displacement of the right hilus. 
 Upper lungs are clear.  I see no good evidence for pneumonia.  Small left
 pleural effusion is probably still present, and may have developed on the
 right as well.
