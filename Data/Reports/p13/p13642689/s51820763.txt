                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p readmission for sepsis  // eval PA line
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube projects approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. Left subclavian
 central line projects over the proximal/ mid SVC. A right IJ Swan-Ganz/PA
 catheter tip overlies the cardiac silhouette, possibly related to the RV
 outflow tract.  An NG type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm,
 off film.
 
 There are surgical clips overlying much of the left chest, with subcutaneous
 emphysema noted adjacent to the left chest wall.
 
 Portions of the diaphragms are excluded from the film and positioning is
 lordotic.  Allowing for this, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Upper zone
 redistribution, a vascular plethora and blurring, and scattered airspace
 opacities are present.  The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary vascular
 congestion and CHF, with an element of pulmonary edema. Multifocal infection
 or pulmonary hemorrhage could also give rise to this appearance.   In
 addition, there is retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.The presence of pleural fluid at the base of the
 left lung would be difficult to exclude.  Pleural fluid and/or thickening is
 seen at the left lung apex. No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Truncated appearance to the anterior lateral portion of the left first rib
 could represent a site of surgery.
 
 Incidental note is made of increased densities adjacent to the right coracoid
 process likely loose bodies related to the glenohumeral joint.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora and blurring, and patchy
 bilateral airspace opacities, consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis could include
 infection or hemorrhage.
 
 Evidence of prior surgery on the left, with pleural fluid and/or thickening at
 the left lung apex, similar to the prior study.
 
 Retrocardiac density again seen, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and likely an element of left pleural fluid.
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
