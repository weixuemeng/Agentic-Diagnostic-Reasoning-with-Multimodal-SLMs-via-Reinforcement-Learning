                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___, AT 1:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tachypnea, evaluate for pulmonary
 edema, pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to previous studies dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 1:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right subclavian PICC line with the tip in the mid to distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.  Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of mild
 interstitial edema.  More focal nodular opacity at the left base could be
 related to edema, although raises the possibility of a loculated effusion,
 atelectasis, or pneumonia.  There is likely a small left effusion. Small
 nodular opacities at both bases are stable at least back to ___,
 and given their density, likely represent calcified granulomas.  Stable
 cardiac and mediastinal contours.
