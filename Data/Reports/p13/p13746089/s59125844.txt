  Slight interval increase in retrocardiac opacification concerning for a
  worsening infectious process.  Incidentally, there appears to be slight

 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Patient has known mediastinal lymphadenopathy
 better seen in prior CT from ___.  Right perihilar and right lower lobe
 opacities have improved, mainly due to improvement in the edema component. 
 The residual opacities in the right lower lobe are a combination of small
 effusion and adjacent consolidation.  This consolidation is most likely
 pneumonia with associated loss of volume.  Opacities in the retrocardiac
 region are minimally increased worrisome for increasing infectious process. 
 The upper lobes are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion
 is small.
