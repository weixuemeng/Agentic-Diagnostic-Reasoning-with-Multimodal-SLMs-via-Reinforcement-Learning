                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 Subtle opacity in the left lung base may represent atelectasis; however, a
 superimposed process such as pneumonia or apsiration is difficult to exclude. 
 Minimal patchy opacity at the right base may represent atelectasis or changes
 related to early infiltrate or aspiration.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is calcification of the aortic knob. Although the
 mural calcification appears displaced inward, the appearance is unchanged
 compared with a chest CTA from ___ which showed adenopathy and meduastinal
 fat accounting for this appearance.  The heart size is borderline. Incidental
 note made of orthopedic soft tissue anchor at coracoid process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left-greater-than right-base may be
 chronic, but a superimposed process such as pneumonia or aspiration is
 difficult to exclude.
 
 COMMENT: ___ discussed findings with ___ at 9:45AM, ___.
