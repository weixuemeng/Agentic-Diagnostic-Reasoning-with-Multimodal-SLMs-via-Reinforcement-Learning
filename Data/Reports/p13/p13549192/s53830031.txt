                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Frontal view shows relatively mild infrahilar peribronchial opacification in
 the left lower lobe which could be all atelectasis.  The area is obscured on
 the lateral film by adipose.  Heart size is top normal, but there is no
 pulmonary vascular abnormality or effusion.  Mild distension of the azygos
 vein suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume.
