                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall, confusion, hx PPM in left thorax, evaluate for
 occult infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  A dual-chamber left pectoral
 pacemaker and its leads project in expected location.  There is no focal
 consolidation pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The aortic arch is heavily calcified.
 Relatively dense nodules in bilateral upper lobes likely represent granulomas
 or pleural and parenchymal scarring.  Surgical clips are noted in the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
