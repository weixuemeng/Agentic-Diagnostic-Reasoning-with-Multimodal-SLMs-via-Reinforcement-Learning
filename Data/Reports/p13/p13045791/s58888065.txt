                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post left upper lobectomy and a subsequent chest wall hernia
 with rib cartilage fractures.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate left lateral chest
 wall postsurgical changes.  The left pneumothorax is not well appreciated on
 frontal view, but the straight interface of fluid on lateral view suggests the
 presence of air in the pleural cavity.  The left pleural effusion is
 increased.  There is decreased left base atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal and lungs are without focal consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Although the left pneumothorax is not well appreciated on frontal view, the
 straight interface of fluid on lateral view suggests the presence of air in
 the pleural cavity. 
 
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion. 
 
 3.  Decreased left base atelectasis.
