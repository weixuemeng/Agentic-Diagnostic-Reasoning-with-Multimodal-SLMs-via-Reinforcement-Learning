 most recently from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 There is volume loss in the left lung compatible with history of left upper
 lobe lobectomy.  Compared to prior study, there is now a small left pleural
 effusion with likely atelectasis at the left base.  The right lung is
 essentially clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left chest wall and subcutaneous emphysema
 is slightly improved since last study.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Slightly improved left chest wall and subcutaneous emphysema.
