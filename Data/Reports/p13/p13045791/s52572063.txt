                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post left upper lobectomy and now with chest
 tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ genu ___
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval removal of
 the left-sided thoracostomy tube.  There is extensive pectoral and
 subcutaneous emphysema, which limits assessment for pneumothorax; any residual
 pneumothorax is very small in volume.  There are stable postoperative changes
 in the left hemithorax, consistent with recent left upper lobe resection.  The
 right lung is clear.
