 FINDINGS:  Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with no detectable
 pneumothorax.  Postoperative alterations are present in the left hemithorax
 consistent with recent left upper lobe resection.  Improving atelectasis is
 present at the left lung base, and there is a persistent small left pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is clear except for minor linear atelectasis in the
 right juxtahilar and basilar regions.  Air-filled distension of the thoracic
 esophagus is present, as well as improving now moderate gastric distension in
 the upper abdomen.
