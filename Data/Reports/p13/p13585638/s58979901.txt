                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, crowding and accentuating the bronchovascular
 structures.  New patchy and linear bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Lungs are otherwise clear,
 and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Heart size, mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.
