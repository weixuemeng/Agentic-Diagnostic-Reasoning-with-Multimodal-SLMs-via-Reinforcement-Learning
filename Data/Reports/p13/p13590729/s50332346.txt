                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left pneumothorax and
 rib fracture, reassessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is minimal interval increase in still
 small-to-moderate left pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion has slightly
 increased, although it might be potentially related to the upright position of
 the patient and the expiration technique of the radiograph.  The left basal
 atelectasis is noted.  Small amount of right pleural effusion is most likely
 present.  Rib fractures are noted involving several ribs, partially imaged.
