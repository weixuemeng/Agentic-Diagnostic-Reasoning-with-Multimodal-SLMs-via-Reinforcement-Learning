                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rib and thoracic spine fractures with increasing O2 requirement. 
 Evaluate for pneumothorax and pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral expiratory radiographs were acquired.  There is a
 moderate left hydropneumothorax, increased in size compared to the most recent
 chest radiograph from ___.  The degree of left-sided pleural
 fluid is unchanged.  A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Left lower
 lung atelectasis is dense, unchanged.  There is minimal right lower lung
 atelectasis.  The upper portions of both lungs are clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  There is no right pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased air component of moderate left hydropneumothorax.
 
 2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Unchanged dense left lower lung atelectasis.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:34
 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study, five minutes after discovery.
