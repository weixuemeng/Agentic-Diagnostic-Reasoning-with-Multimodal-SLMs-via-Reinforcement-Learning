                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of chest were reviewed in comparison
 with prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are well expanded.  A nodular opacity of 7.6 cm is seen
 at the left lung base overlapping the anterior end of rib.  This nodular
 opacity can potentially represent either lung nodule or could be artifactual
 and needs to be further evaluated with repeat frontal chest radiograph with
 nipple markers and supplemented by shallow oblique views.  Right lung is
 clear.  There are on lung opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Heart size is
 top normal, unchanged since prior study from ___.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A small 7.6-mm nodular opacity in the left lung base overlying
 the anterior end of sixth rib is concerning for lung nodule, however, could be
 artifactual or within the bones or could be a nipple. For further evaluation
 and differentiation, repeat PA radiograph with a nipple markers supplemented
 by shallow oblique views is recommended.  Dr. ___ was paged on ___ at 4:50 p.m. and the findings were discussed.
