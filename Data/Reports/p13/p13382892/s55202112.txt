                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Progressive dyspnea on exertion and intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including moderate cardiomegaly.  There is widening of the vascular pedicle,
 suggesting fluid overload, but again similar to the prior study.  There is
 probably a trace pleural effusion on the right.  The chest is hyperinflated. 
 Prominent interstitium with indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggests mild vascular congestion.  Mild degenerative changes are similar
 along the mid to lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion and probably a trace
 pleural effusion.
