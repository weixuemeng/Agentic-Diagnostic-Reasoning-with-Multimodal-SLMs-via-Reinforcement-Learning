 In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube remains in place
 with no evidence of pneumothorax. Small residual pleural effusion with
 atelectatic changes at the base. The degree of opacification in the lower

 effusion, or merely be a manifestation of a more erect position of the
 patient.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
