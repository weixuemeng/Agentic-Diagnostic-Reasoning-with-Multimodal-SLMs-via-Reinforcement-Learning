 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the appearance of the heart and lungs.  The patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration. The right peritracheal convexity widening the mediastinum
 is again noted.  Air-fluid level in the right upper zone is consistent with a
 loculated area of hydro pneumothorax.  The left lung is essentially clear.
