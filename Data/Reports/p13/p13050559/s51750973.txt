 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the right upper lobe improved between ___ and ___ with
 remission of central adenopathy.  It worsened between ___ and ___, the last preprocedure chest radiograph.  Now following bronchoscopy the
 consolidation is more severe. This could be due to worsened occlusion and more
 atelectasis and retained secretions, or bleeding. Chest radiograph obtained 6
 hr later, available the time of this review shows improvement, nearly to the
 extent of aeration prior to the bronchoscopy.  On this study there is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion in the left lung is clear. Heart size has
 been consistently normal. The right supraclavicular dual channel central
