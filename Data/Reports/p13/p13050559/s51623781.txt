                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with B cell lymphoma of the mediastinum,
 status-post right thoractomy and right upper lobectomy with intercostal muscle
 flap on ___; evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right Port-A-Cath and right chest tube appear intact and unchanged in
 position. New small right apical pneumothorax.  Interval slight widening and
 prominence of the right paratracheal convexity. Otherwise, expected
 post-surgical changes in the right hemithorax. Stable smaller lung volumes.
 Normal heart size. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Slight interval widening of the right mediastinal contour, possibly due to
 a combination of postoperative changes and known intercostal muscle flap.
 However, an expanding postoperative blood or fluid collection cannot be
 excluded, and close monitoring and follow-up imaging is recommended.
 
 2.  New, small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 10:45 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
