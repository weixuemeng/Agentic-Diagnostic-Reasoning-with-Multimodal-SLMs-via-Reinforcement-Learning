                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with mediastinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
 status-post right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy with hand-sewn closure
 and intercostal muscle buttress; evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No significant interval change. Stable radiographic appearance and size of the
 right paratracheal opacity. Stable loss of right lung volume. The large
 opacity at the right lung base probably reflects a combination of a
 subpulmonic right pleural effusion with lateral-shift of the right diaphragm
 apex and adjacent atelectasis. Stable small right apical pneumothorax. No new
 focal consolidation. No left pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. No change in the position of the right Port-A-Cath or
 mediastinal surgical clips. Small amount of sub-cutaneous emphysema in the
 right lower lateral thoracic wall at the prior site of chest tube insertion.
 No acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable radiographic appearance of the right paratracheal opacity.
 
 2.  Stable, large right subpulmonic pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 
 3.  Stable, small right apical pneumothorax.
