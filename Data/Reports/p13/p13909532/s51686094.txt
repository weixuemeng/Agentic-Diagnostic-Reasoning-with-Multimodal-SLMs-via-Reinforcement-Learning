                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right lower lobe lung mass
 concerning for malignancy, status post endobronchial ultrasound evaluation. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta mildly prominent, but no local contour
 abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  In
 the right hemithorax, a centrally located mass (approximately 3.5 cm diameter)
 is identified in infrahilar position.  Its location dorsally as seen on the
 lateral view appears to be identical with the previously identified pulmonary
 right lower lobe mass noted on chest examination of ___.  In
 comparison with the, at that time obtained, oblique views, there is now more
 evidence of peripheral parenchymal infiltrates in the right lower lobe
 posterior segment, probably related to the more centrally located mass. 
 Thickening of the pleural space in this area and mild elevation of the
 posterior right diaphragm suggest involvement of the pleural space, which was
 not present on previous examination transferred from ___.
