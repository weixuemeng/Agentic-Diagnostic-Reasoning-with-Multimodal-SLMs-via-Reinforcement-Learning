                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NSCLC with effusion and edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pleural
 effusion appears somewhat less, though much of this could relate to change in
 patient position.  Pleural drain remains unchanged at the right base
 laterally.  An area of lucency around it could reflect loculated pneumothorax.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  Continued substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.
