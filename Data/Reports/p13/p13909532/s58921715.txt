 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer, history of prior pleural effusion,
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right pleural
 effusion has substantially increased in extent.  The effusion now occupies
 about two thirds of the right hemithorax.  There is additional volume loss of
 the right lung parenchyma due to the known right hilar lung cancer.  The
 position of the right pleural drain is unchanged.  Minimal left pleural
 effusion.  Known right apical thickening.
