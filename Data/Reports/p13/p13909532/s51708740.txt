                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:40 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Bilateral Pleurx catheters.  Previous right lung collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has increased.  Right lung is largely airless
 with the presumption of a large right hilar mass occluding most of the right
 bronchial tree.  Left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion, with a small pleural drainage catheter in place.  Right pleural
 drains are sitting in a small pocket of air at the base of the largely
 collapsed right lung.  Heart size is indeterminate, obscured by right pleural
 and parenchymal abnormalities.  ET tube in standard placement.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged, as soon as the findings were appreciated.
