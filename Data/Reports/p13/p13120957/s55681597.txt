                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with midepigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Linear retrocardiac densities were seen previously and may represent
 atelectasis.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating pulmonary vasculature and
 hila.  Heart and mediastinal contours appear similar compared to prior.  There
 is no evidence for free intraperitoneal air below the diaphragms. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for acute process.
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
