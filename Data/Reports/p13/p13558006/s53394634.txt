                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 3:48 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.  Cauda equina syndrome, left lower extremity
 weakness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is longstanding, was accompanied by
 left lower lobe collapse on ___.  It cannot be sure whether it has
 improved, but there is now strong suggestion of new consolidation in the left
 upper lobe or an unusual collection of pleural fluid.  I would recommend
 repeat chest radiograph with careful attention to removing all appliances both
 in front and behind the patient's chest in order to get a better imaging of
 the left upper lobe particularly.  Examination should be performed with the
 patient erect to detect new pleural effusion.
 
 Right lung is low in volume, but clear.  Heart is top normal size, but
 mediastinal veins are dilated, suggesting volume overload.  ET tube is in
 standard position and a nasogastric tube ends looped in the upper stomach.
