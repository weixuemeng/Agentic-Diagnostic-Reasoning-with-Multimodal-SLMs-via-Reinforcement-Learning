 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms on the lateral image indicate
 mild overinflation, potentially caused by a COPD.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  A
 subtle nodular opacity projects over the anterior portion of the first right
 rib, the posterior portion of the right fifth rib and the scapular and likely
 reflect a bony structure.  It is not visible on the lateral radiograph.  No
 pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions no visible rib fractures. 
 Severe degenerative changes at the level of the left shoulder.  If the
 clinical symptoms persists, a dedicated rib series should be performed.
