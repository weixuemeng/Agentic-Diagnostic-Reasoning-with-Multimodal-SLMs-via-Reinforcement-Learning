                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with complete heart block, status post
 dual-chamber pacemaker via left cephalic and axillary approach.  Evaluate lead
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP portable chest
 examination of ___.  Marked cardiomegaly and status post
 sternotomy with evidence of bypass surgery as before.  In the interval, the
 patient has received a permanent pacer located in left anterior axillary
 position.  Connection exists with two intracavitary electrodes, one of which
 terminates in a position compatible with the right atrial appendage, the
 second lead reaches the apical portion of the right ventricle.  The patient
 was unable to elevate her arms for the lateral view, but still well penetrated
 image allows exclusion of any significant pleural effusion in the posterior
 pleural sinuses.  The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone
 redistribution pattern, but there is no evidence of interstitial or alveolar
 edema.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates can be seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Permanent pacer placement with two intracavitary electrodes in
 appropriate position in the right atrium and the right ventricle.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
