 nephrectomy, aortic and mitral valve replacements on warfarin, who presented
 on ___ for altered mental status.  Course c/b GIB and wound infection, now

 edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  There is increased opacification involving the right
 hemithorax, much of which has an appearance consistent with asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  However, the degree of asymmetry is quite pronounced,
 raising the possibility that some of the opacification may represent
 superimposed pneumonia.
 The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.
