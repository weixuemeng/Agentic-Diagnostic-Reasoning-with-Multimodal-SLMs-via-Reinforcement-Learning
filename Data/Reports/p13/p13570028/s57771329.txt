 lobe nodules measuring 2.9 x 3.2 cm and 1.4 x 1.5 cm, seen on frontal view,
 and a posterior nodule measuring 1.7 x 1.3 cm on lateral view which likely
 corresponds with a nodule posterior to the right hilus on CT chest.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, better evaluated on recent CT chest.
