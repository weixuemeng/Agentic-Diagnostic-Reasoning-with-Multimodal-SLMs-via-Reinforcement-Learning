                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with huntingtons, ?aspiration pna  // ?pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Low lung volumes significantly limit the assessment.  The lungs appear grossly
 clear though volumes are quite low.  Heart size cannot be assessed. 
 Mediastinal contour appears normal.  There is relative prominence of the left
 pulmonary hilum though may reflect bronchovascular crowding in the setting of
 poor inspiratory effort.  No pneumothorax or large effusion.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evaluation is markedly limited due to low lung volumes.  Relative prominence
 of the left pulmonary hilum could reflect bronchovascular crowding due to low
 lung volumes.  Repeat study is recommended with more optimal inspiratory
 effort.
