                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Urosepsis, hypoxic and tachycardic.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval since the prior study, there is new right lower
 lobe opacity which may be due to infection/pneumonia or aspiration.  Left base
 retrocardiac opacity is also seen with some obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis, although an underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  A subcentimeter left lower lobe calcified
 granuloma is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval development of right lower lobe consolidation worrisome
 for infection or aspiration.  Correlate clinically.  Left base atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax.
