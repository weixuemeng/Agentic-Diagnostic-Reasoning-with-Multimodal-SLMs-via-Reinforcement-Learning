                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and coughing blood  // pna or mass    
 pna or mass
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The lung volumes are low.  There is bilateral relatively
 symmetrical hilar enlargement without obliteration of mediastinal contours or
 lines.  In addition, parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms are
 visualized, on both the frontal and the lateral radiograph, at the bases of
 the right lung, in the middle lobe, as well as in the more peripheral areas of
 the left upper lobe and the lingular.
 The size of the heart is at the upper range of normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  No pleural effusions are visualized.
 
 The findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia with reactive hilar
 lymphadenopathy.  Although no interstitial nodularity is seen, sarcoid should
 be included in the differential diagnosis, because of the hilar morphology,
 but is less likely.
