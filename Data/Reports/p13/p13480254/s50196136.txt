                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal image of the chest demonstrates clearing of the
 previously seen mild pulmonary edema.  Now seen is a left pleural effusion,
 unchanged in size from previous imaging.  A small right pleural effusion is
 also seen.  Calcifications at the lung bases are again seen which are
 consistent with asbestos exposure.  The cardiac silhouette is very large.  The
 left-sided predominance of the patient's pleural effusion could unusual, left
 dominant pleural effusion due to heart failure (usually right-sided
 predominance), but could also be due to pleural pathology or
 pleuro-pericarditis.  Given the findings of asbestos exposure, this raises
 concern for mesothelioma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate-sized, unexplained left pleural effusion and
 massive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  Asbestos related pleural
 calcifications.
