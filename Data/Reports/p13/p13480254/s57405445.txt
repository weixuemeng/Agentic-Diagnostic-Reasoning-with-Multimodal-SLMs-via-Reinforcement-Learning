                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath status post CABG. 
 Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable left
 pectoral cardiac pacer with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Post-surgical changes of
 prior coronary arterial bypass grafting are present.  There is persistent
 marked cardiomegaly and left greater than right pleural effusions, somewhat
 improved on the right.  Mild vascular congestion is present.  There has been
 interval increased left lower lobe density, which could represent a
 combination of persistent large effusion and underlying consolidation. 
 Streaky right lower lung opacity also persists.  A linear density in the right
 upper quadrant and a subdiaphragmatic vascular stent appear unchanged since
 prior exams.  There is thoracolumbar spondylosis and possibly bridging
 anterior ossification, suggestive of a diffuse idiopathic skeletal
 hyperostosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large left and diminishing small right pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Persistent marked cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema, suggestive of
 a component of heart failure.
 
 3.  Increasing confluent density in the left lower lobe may represent a
 combination of large effusion and underlying consolidation, possibly
 atelectasis versus infection.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity, could also
 represent infection versus atelectasis.
