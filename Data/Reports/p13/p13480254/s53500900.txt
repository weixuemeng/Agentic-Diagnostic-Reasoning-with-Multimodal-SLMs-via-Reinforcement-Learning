                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left pleural effusion, now requiring 
 followup assessment of the effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal image of the chest demonstrates a
 moderate-to-large left pleural effusion unchanged since previous imaging.  A
 right lower lobe opacity is seen which is also unchanged since previous
 imaging.  Pulmonary vessels are better defined and less engorged than on
 previous imaging, suggesting resolving interstitial edema.  Again seen is
 significant cardiomegaly.  A pacer is seen with leads following the expected
 course to the right atrium and right ventricle.  Calcification of the pleura
 at the right lung base is consistent with asbestos exposure, and given the
 persistent left pleural effusion without known source, a possible mesothelioma
 would need to be ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate-to-large left pleural effusion, unchanged
 from previous imaging.  Right lower lobe opacity unchanged from previous
 imaging.  Significant cardiomegaly.  Asbestos-related pleural calcifications.
