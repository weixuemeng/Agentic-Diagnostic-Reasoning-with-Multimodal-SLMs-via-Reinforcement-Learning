                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Rigors.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles, similar to prior, which may be
 due to minimal pleural thickening, although trace pleural effusions are not
 excluded.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no overt pulmonary
 edema.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position,
 with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Not well seen compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction on the lateral view is grossly stable as compared to
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusions versus pleural thickening. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
