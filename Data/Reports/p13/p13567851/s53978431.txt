 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker remains in unchanged position, with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and right ventricle. As compared to prior chest
 radiograph, lung volumes are decreased. There is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which could reflect a small pleural effusion. Otherwise, 
 no focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac silhouette
 remains stable in size.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely
 secondary to a small left-sided pleural effusion. No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.
