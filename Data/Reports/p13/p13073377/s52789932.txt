                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube passes into the
 stomach, its tip not imaged.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Allowing for technique, the heart is probably normal in
 size.  Each hilum is enlarged and indistinct suggesting pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  In addition, there is a focal right upper lobe opacity.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.  Focal right
 upper lobe opacity; differential considerations include sequela of pneumonia,
 aspiration or focal edema, perhaps resolving or impending atelectasis. 
 Short-term followup radiographs are suggested to reassess.
