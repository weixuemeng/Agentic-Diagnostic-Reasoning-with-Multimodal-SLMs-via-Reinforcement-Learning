 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aortic arch is calcified.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is demonstrated with upper zone vascular redistribution. Small left
 pleural effusion is likely present. Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine.
