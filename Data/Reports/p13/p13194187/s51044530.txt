                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and is accompanied by mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Linear opacities at the lung bases are suggestive of
 linear atelectasis and/or scarring.  On the lateral view, a slightly more
 focal opacity is present in the left lower lobe, partially obscuring the
 posterior left hemidiaphragm in the region of the lower thoracic spine. 
 Probable very small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Focal left lower lobe opacity, which may be due to either atelectasis or
 focal pneumonia.
