                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Palpitations, evaluate for pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged, particularly the left ventricle, unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary
 venous congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity at the
 lung bases may reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
