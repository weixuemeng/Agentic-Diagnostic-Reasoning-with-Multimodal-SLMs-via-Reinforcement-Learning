                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is persistent posterior density in the left lower lobe, although
 decreased, suggesting improvement in atelectasis and pleural effusions
 although very small pleural effusions may persist.  Upper zone redistribution
 of pulmonary vascularity suggests pulmonary venous hypertension, but without
 frank congestive heart failure on this study, which has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving patchy retrocardiac opacity and pleural effusions. 
 Marked decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion with findings suggesting only
 pulmonary venous hypertension.
