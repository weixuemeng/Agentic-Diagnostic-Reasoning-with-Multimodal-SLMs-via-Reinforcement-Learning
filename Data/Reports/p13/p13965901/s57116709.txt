                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New right IJ central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 21:55.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP supine view of the chest.  The right IJ central venous line is in place
 with its tip at the superior cavoatrial junction.  The endotracheal tube is in
 appropriate position ending 3 cm in the carina.  The enteric tube extends off
 the imaged portion however the  side port is above the GE junction.  A wedge
 shaped opacity in the right hilar region is unchanged consistent with collapse
 of the superior segment of the right lower lobe. There is an apparent central,
 right juxtahilar mass. Small amount of pleural fluid is observed in the right
 minor fissure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Placement of right IJ central venous line with its tip at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  No evidence of complication.  
 
 2. Side port of enteric tube is above the GE junction, recommend advancing.
 
 3. Superior segment of right lower lobe is collapsed, with an adjacent right
 hilar opacity raises concern for underlying mass.  Recommend CT for further
 evaluation as this could represent a neoplasm such as carcinoid or lymphoma,
 or an agressive infection in this patient with HIV infection. 
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
