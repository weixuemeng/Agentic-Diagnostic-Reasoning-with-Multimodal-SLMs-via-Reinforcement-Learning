                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and hypoglycemia.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased interstitial markings, most consistent
 with mild pulmonary edema.  At the right base, there is an ill-defined
 opacity, which may be related the edema, though a superimposed infection is
 difficult to exclude.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, and unchanged from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  More focal opacity at the right base may be related to the edema, though
 an infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 4.  Mild cardiomegaly.
