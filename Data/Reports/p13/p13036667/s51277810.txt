 INDICATION:  Cough.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar hazy opacities are most consistent with atelectasis,
 although in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be fully
 excluded.  There is no evidence of edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 A dual-lead chamber pacemaker is present with the leads in proper position. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There are atherosclerotic
 calcifications in the aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar hazy opacities are likely atelectasis, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.
