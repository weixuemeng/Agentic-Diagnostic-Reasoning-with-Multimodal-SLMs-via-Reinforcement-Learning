                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status after receiving
 Ativan at outside hospital.  Question aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the patient to be
 rotated to the right.  Allowing for such, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is unfolded, with extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, or
 large effusion.  There is suggestion of Kerley B lines in the lower lungs,
 raising question of volume overload.  There may be trace dependent atelectasis
 in the right base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild pulmonary edema.  No confluent consolidation in the
 lung.  If basilar interstitial prominence persists following treatment for
 edema, consider chronic interstitial disease.
