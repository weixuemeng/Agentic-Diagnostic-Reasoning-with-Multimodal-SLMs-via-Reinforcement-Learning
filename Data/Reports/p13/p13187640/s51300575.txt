  Prominent left hilum is nonspecific, underlying lymphadenopathy,
  consolidation, or pulmonary lesion not excluded.
  
  Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to pneumonia, underlying other
  pulmonary lesion not excluded.
  
  Bibasilar subtle reticulonodular opacities may be due to small airways
  disease.
  
  Consider dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest or CT for better
  evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sternal, back, and axillary abscess, concern
 for intrapulm. abscess.  // c/f lung abscess vs other intra pulm process vs
 bony mets/abscess into the bone.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  There are relatively low lung
 volumes.  Left hilar prominence may be due to vascular congestion although
 underlying lymphadenopathy, pulmonary consolidation, or other pulmonary lesion
 is not excluded.  Reticular nodular opacities at the lung bases are
 nonspecific but could be due to small airways disease.  There is also
 additional more focal left base retrocardiac opacity ; differential diagnosis
 includes pneumonia although underlying pulmonary mass is not excluded.
 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
 
 Chronic deformity at the partially imaged right glenohumeral joint.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent left hilum is nonspecific, underlying lymphadenopathy,
 consolidation, or pulmonary lesion not excluded.
 
 Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to pneumonia, underlying other
 pulmonary lesion not excluded.
 
 Bibasilar subtle reticulonodular opacities may be due to small airways
 disease.
 
 Consider dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest or CT for better
 evaluation.
