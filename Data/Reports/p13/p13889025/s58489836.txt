 INDICATION:  ___M with EF15, received fluids, tachypneic.  Assess for edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated with subtle veil like opacity along
 bilateral lower hemithoraces, right greater than left, suggestive of small
 pleural effusions.  Mild cephalization of vasculature with bilateral
 ground-glass opacities are again noted.  There is persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly which is unchanged in appearance since scout images from prior CT
 scan.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent mild pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral
 pleural effusions and cephalization of vasculature.
