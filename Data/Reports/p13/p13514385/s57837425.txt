                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate moderate pulmonary
 edema, which has worsened since prior imaging.  There is increased opacity in
 the right lung base, consistent with a moderate right pleural effusion.  There
 is a small left basilar opacity again seen, consistent with a small left
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again seen,
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema, worse since previous imaging. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
