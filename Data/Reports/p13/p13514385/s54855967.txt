                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Dementia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  Within the limitations of technique, including low lung volumes, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within normal range.  The
 upper mediastinum and medial lung apices are obscured by the chin flexion.  A
 mild diffuse interstitial abnormality suggests minimal fluid overload.  Patchy
 left basilar opacity is most compatible with atelectasis.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  There is a compression deformity along the lower thoracic
 spine, which is incompletely characterized.  A surgical clip projects over the
 right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of slight fluid overload and patchy left
 basilar atelectasis.  Lower thoracic compression deformity, incompletely
 characterized.
