  Since the thoracentesis, there has been an interval decrease in size of the
  left pleural effusion. A moderate pleural effusions still is present.  There
  is no right pleural effusion. The mediastinum is no longer shifted rightward.
  Lung volumes are lower, though there is no new opacities to suggest pneumonia.
  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Reassessment of pleural effusion, post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right PICC terminates at the upper SVC.  A moderate left pleural effusion
 has improved since the ___, now demonstrating aeration of the left
 upper lobe and resolution of previously seen right mediastinal shift. There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion with mild edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion has improved, reflecting interval
 thoracentesis. Previously seen right mediastinal shift has resolved. No
 pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
