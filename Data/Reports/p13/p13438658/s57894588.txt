                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis and hematemesis  // eval for
 pneumonia, aspiration      eval for pneumonia, aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in
 the substantial left pleural effusion with compensatory volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  There are somewhat lower lung volumes.  Nasogastric tube is
 in unchanged position.
 No definite evidence for acute pneumonia.  However, this would be difficult to
 unequivocally exclude given the extensive changes in the lower left lung an
 the absence of a lateral view.
