                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hepatic encephalopathy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large left pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size compared to
 the previous study.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours unchanged.  There is
 continued left basilar opacification likely reflective of compressive
 atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Patchy right
 basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to
 exclude.  No right-sided focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large left pleural effusion, slightly increased in size compared to the
 previous study with left basilar compressive atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but
 infection is difficult to exclude.
