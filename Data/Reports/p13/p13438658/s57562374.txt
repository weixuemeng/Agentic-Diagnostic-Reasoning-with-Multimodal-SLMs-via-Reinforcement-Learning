                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new hypoxia and AMS.  Please evaluate for
 volume overload and/or new infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is near complete opacification of the left lung, progressed since the
 prior study, compatible with worsening accumulation of pleural fluid
 collapsing the entire right lung.  .  Patchy opacity at the right lung base
 could represent developing infection versus aspiration.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette cannot be well assessed due to the large pleural effusion.  No
 large pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of the left large hydrothorax causing near complete
 collapse of the left lung.
 
 Worsening or new right lower lobe  pneumonia or atelectasis.  Small residual
 right pleural effusion.
