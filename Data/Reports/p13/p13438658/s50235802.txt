                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough and rhinorrhea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left costophrenic angle
 and hemidiaphragm are obscured, suggestive of moderate pleural effusion. 
 Adjacent opacity is also noted.  Right lung is clear.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size cannot be accurately assessed due to
 adjacent pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent opacity, which may represent
 atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
