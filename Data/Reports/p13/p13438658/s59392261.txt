                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 A left pleural effusion has increased in size substantially since the prior
 radiograph, and is associated with contralateral shift of the
 cardiomediastinal contours as well as near collapse of the left lung with some
 residual aerated lung in the left upper lobe.  Right lung and pleural surfaces
 are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pleural effusion, for which the differential diagnosis
 includes hemothorax, infection, and malignancy, among other potential causes.
