                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status, r/o PNA  // ?PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a large left pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis which is not significantly changed relative
 to prior study dated ___.  Imaged lungs are grossly clear without
 a focal consolidation worrisome for an infectious process.  Streaky opacities
 within the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours appear grossly stable dose obscured by left pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall stable appearance of the chest relative to prior study dated ___ with large left pleural effusion.  No focal opacity convincing
 for pneumonia is identified although fluid somewhat limits evaluation.
