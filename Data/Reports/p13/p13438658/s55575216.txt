                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left hydrothorax s/p chest tube, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier same-day chest radiograph ___ at 10:36.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval insertion of a left chest tube seen projecting over
 the left lateral lower lung, with significant interval improvement in the size
 of the now with small left pleural effusion.  There has been interval
 re-expansion of much of the left lung, which appears clear.  There is some
 residual opacification of the left lower lung likely related to small residual
 hydrothorax and adjacent left lower lung relaxation atelectasis.  There has
 been interval resolution of rightward shift of mediastinal structures, now
 normal in appearance and location.  The right lung remains clear.  There is no
 right pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant interval improvement in a now small left hydrothorax status post
 left chest tube insertion, with re-expansion of the left lung and resolution
 of rightward shift of mediastinal structures.  Small residual left pleural
 effusion with adjacent left lower lobe relaxation atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax.
