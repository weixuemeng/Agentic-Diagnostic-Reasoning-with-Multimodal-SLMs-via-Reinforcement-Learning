                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusions, status post chest tube placement on
 ___, here to evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain low.  There is interval improvement in
 aeration of the left lung with decreased size of left pleural effusion from
 ___ and significantly decreased from ___.  A left pleural pigtail
 catheter is in similar position.  A smaller right pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is improved but persistent mild
 left pulmonary edema, likely related to reexpansion.  The cardiomediastinal
 contours are exaggerated by low lung volumes but likely within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decreased size of left pleural effusion with improved
 but persistent left reexpansion pulmonary edema.
