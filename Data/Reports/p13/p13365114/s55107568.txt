                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sudden onset of altered mental status, history
 of pancreatic cancer.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Diffuse interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs
 bilaterally.  There is more confluent consolidation in the retrocardiac
 region.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Osseous structures are
 grossly unremarkable noting possible cerclage wire in the lower cervical
 region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs, potentially
 due to interstitial edema with more discrete consolidation at the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis however developing infiltrate could also be
 considered.  Two-view chest x-ray may offer additional detail.
