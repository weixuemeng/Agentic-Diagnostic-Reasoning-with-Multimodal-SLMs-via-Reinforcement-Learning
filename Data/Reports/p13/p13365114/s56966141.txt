                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are findings consistent with COPD
 including increased AP diameter of the chest and flattening of the diaphragms.
 Prominent reticular markings at the bases may indicate pulmonary fibrosis. 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly, as previously seen.  A mid thoracic wedge
 compression deformity appears unchanged from the radiographs of nine days
 prior though no remote examinations are available for comparison.
