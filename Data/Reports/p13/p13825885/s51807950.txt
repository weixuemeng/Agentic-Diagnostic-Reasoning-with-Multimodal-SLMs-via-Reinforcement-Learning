                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with streaky
 opacification at the bilateral lung bases compatible with atelectasis.  There
 is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is accentuated in size, partially due to under-inflation of
 the lungs, but likely within normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is unfolded
 with prominence of the mediastinum, but no change from the prior study.  The
 trachea is midline.  There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.
