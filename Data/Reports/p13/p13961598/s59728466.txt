                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST THREE VIEWS, ___, AT 8:35 A.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever with possible right apical
 nodule, lordotic views.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP, lordotic and lateral views of the lungs.  Apparent nodular
 opacity at the right lung apex is likely due to summation shadows from ribs. 
 There has been no change since earlier exam without consolidation, effusion or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Hypertrophic changes are seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No visualized right apical nodule, which was likely due to
 summation of shadows.
