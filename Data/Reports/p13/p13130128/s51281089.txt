                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS: Recent prior abdominal CT.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is a streaky opacity,
 which is better seen on the lateral view, residing inferior and posterior to
 the hilum and probably relates to the left lower lobe where patchy atelectasis
 was seen on the recent prior CT.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There
 are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, the morphology of which suggested minor
 atelectasis on the recent prior CT, although it is possible that the situation
 may have changed and early bronchopneumonia is not excluded by this study.
