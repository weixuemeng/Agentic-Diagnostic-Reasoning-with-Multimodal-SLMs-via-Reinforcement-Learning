                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:40 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ischemic heart disease, presenting with CHF
 exacerbation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:16 p.m.:
 
 Lung volumes have improved at both lung bases, particularly the right, a good
 indication that previous findings were not due to pneumonia.  Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema has also improved.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable.  Fractured sternal wires, probably explained by chronically
 non-fused sternum after median sternotomy.
