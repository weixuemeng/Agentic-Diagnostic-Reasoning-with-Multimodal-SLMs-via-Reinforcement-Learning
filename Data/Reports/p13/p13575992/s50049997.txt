                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with a new dual-chamber ICD.  Evaluate lead
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads
 are in standard positions.  Yesterday's mild pulmonary edema has resolved. 
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.  Heart is
 top normal size, unchanged over the long term.  Also unchanged since at least
 ___ are fractures of the two uppermost sternal wires, which
 developed sometime after ___ when non-fusion of the manubrium was
 already evident radiographically.
 
 Persistent separation of the upper sternal fragments therefore does not
 suggest infection, but it is an explanation for fracture of the wires.
