  Right PICC tip projects at level of low superior vena cava. No acute
  changes detected; evaluation of the left mid-lung is limited due to
  overlying hardware. Pacing leads appear similarly positioned on this
  frontal view. Fractured sternal wires again noted. Slight inferior
  subluxation of the humeral head relative to the glenoid, which may be
  positional/projectional, but clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new PICC line.  The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC.  The course
 of the line is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of complications, notably
 no pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, unchanged radiograph with borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette, left pectoral pacemaker, and absence of acute lung changes.
