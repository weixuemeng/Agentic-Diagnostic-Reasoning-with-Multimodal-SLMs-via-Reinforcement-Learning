                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with heart failure requiring oxygen.  Suspect lead
 infection.  Evaluate for pleural effusions and decompensated heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___.
 
 Borderline interstitial pulmonary edema has increased since ___. 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable, and I doubt that left pleural
 thickening has improved, but there is probably no appreciable pleural
 effusion.  Upper sternal wires are disrupted as before and there has been no
 change in the relatively mild misalignment of the third with respect to the
 second and fourth sternal wires.  Transvenous right atrial pacer and right
 ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective
 positions as are two epicardial leads.  Detection of purulent fluid collection
 related to lead placements or pericardial effusion would require CT scanning.
