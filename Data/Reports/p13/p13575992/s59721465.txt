                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  The imaged field of view
 excludes the inferior right costophrenic angle.  Lung volumes are low.  A
 right basilar opacity is insufficiently assessed.  There is no focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  The
 epicardial and dual-chamber intracardiac pacing leads are in stable position. 
 The upper 2 sternal wire remain fractured.  The tip of a right-sided tunneled
 central catheter terminates in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes.
 
 2.  A repeat exam with better inspiration, ideally a PA and lateral film,
 should be obtained to better assess the right base for focal consolidation.
