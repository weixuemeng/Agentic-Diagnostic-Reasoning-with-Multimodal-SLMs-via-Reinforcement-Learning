                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent chest tube placement,
 evaluate hemothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day.  The
 left-sided basal density that obliterates the diaphragmatic contour and widens
 the space of the lateral pleura along the chest wall remains and may have even
 increased slightly.  Aerated volume of the left lung appears compromised. 
 Comparison is made with the next previous PA and lateral chest examination of
 ___.  The position of the previously described left-sided chest
 tube is unchanged, terminates in the axillary area where its final tip is
 slightly bent in caudal direction.  Provided that chest tube drainage is free,
 one would have expected some reduction in the densities if caused by pleural
 effusion.  One therefore should also consider hematoma formation within the
 chest wall itself following the thoracic surgical placement of the epicardial
 electrodes to the lateral wall of the left ventricle.  Position of previously
 described permanent pacer with ICD and right atrial electrode remains as
 before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Situation was discussed with referring physician, ___. ___
 ___.  Hematocrit remains stable.  If surgical revision is required, one
 should consider also sizable chest wall hematoma rather than pleural effusion
 alone.
