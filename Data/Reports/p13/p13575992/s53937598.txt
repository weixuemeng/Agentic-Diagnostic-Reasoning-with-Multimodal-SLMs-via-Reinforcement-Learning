                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with systolic and diastolic
 heart failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged in a globular manner, unchanged.  Mediastinum is
 stable.  Multiple broken sternal wires are redemonstrated.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval improvement in interstitial
 pulmonary edema, currently mild.  There is also improvement in more focal
 right upper lobe opacity.  Prominence of pulmonary arteries is demonstrated,
 most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion is seen.
