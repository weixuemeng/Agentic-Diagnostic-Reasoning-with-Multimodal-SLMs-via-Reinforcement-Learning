 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man being cooled, who desated signficantly with being
 moved.  // eval for pneumo? colapse      eval for pneumo? colapse
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse
 diameter of the heart. There is some increasing opacification in the right
 perihilar region.  This could reflect aspiration or developing infection.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.
