  1. Prominence of the cardiac silhouette and vasculature may be related to
  technique.  If concern for cardiovascular status could be assessed with PA and
  lateral.
  2. Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis though aspiration or
  infection are also possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the cardiac silhouette and vasculature may be related to
 technique.  There is bibasilar opacities.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Apparent increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and vasculature may
 be related to accentuation by apical lordotic and portable technique. 
 Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs could be obtained for more accurate
 assessment of the patient's cardiovascular status if warranted clinically.
 2. Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or early
 infectious pneumonia.
