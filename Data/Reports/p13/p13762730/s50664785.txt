                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bradycardia, evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged, as seen on prior radiographs from
 ___.  There is haziness of the hila with diffuse, but
 predominantly mid and lower lung heterogeneous opacities, consistent with
 moderate pulmonary edema, likely with both interstitial and alveolar
 components.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as before. 
 There may be small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic in nature given
 marked enlargement of the heart.
