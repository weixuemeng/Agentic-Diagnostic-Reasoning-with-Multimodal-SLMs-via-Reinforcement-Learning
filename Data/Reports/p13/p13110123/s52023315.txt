                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with syncope, known multiple PEs, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prominence of the right mediastinum likely reflects patient rotation and a
 tortuous thoracic aorta.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 The hila are suboptimally assessed given rotation, but grossly within normal
 limits.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Right
 lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Tortuous thoracic aorta.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.
