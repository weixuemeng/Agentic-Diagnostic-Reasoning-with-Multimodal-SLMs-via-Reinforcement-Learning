                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute onset dyspnea on exertion and rales on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Streaky
 basilar retrocardiac opacity seen on the lateral view, may be overlying the
 right lung base on the frontal view, could be due to atelectasis but infection
 is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky basilar retrocardiac opacities may be due to atelectasis,
 but infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
