                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, infectious work-up
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Suture material is again seen
 projecting over the left lower lung with tiny clips in the left upper abdomen.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are increased from prior and small in overall
 volume.  Also noted is pleural based opacity at the right apex and along the
 periphery of the right mid lung which is concerning for loculated effusion
 similar in appearance to prior exam.  Ground-glass opacities in the lower
 lungs raise concern for pneumonia.  In addition, ill-defined opacity in the
 right upper lung may reflect a component of pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Imaged bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing pleural effusions, small in volume with lower lobe ground-glass
 opacity concerning for pneumonia.  Probable loculated pleural effusion along
 the right lung apex and periphery of the right mid lung.  Possible additional
 focus of pneumonia in the right upper lobe.
