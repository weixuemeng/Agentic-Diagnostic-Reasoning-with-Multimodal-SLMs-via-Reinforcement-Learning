                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits and unchanged.  The lungs demonstrate retrocardiac
 opacities as well as an opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle.  An area of
 linear atelectasis in the right mid lung has progressed or perhaps this
 opacity may represent fluid in the minor fissure.  A widespread
 mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality involves the right lung with sparing
 of the left mid and upper lung.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggest
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities most suggestive of pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting; noting widespread interstitial changes in the
 right upper lung compared to the left, the possibility of asymmetric edema
 with bibasilar atelectasis could be considered but seems less likely.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
