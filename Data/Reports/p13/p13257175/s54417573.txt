 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia,
 right-sided chest discomfort.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is moderate
 improvement, with larger lung volumes and improved ventilation of the basal
 lung areas.
 
 On the right, a plate-like atelectasis along the minor fissure persists, but
 the pre-existing medial basal opacity has substantially decreased in extent
 and severity.
 
 On the left, the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is also improved.
 
 The bilateral pleural effusions, better visualized on the lateral than on the
 frontal radiograph, are not substantially changed.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
 
 No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
