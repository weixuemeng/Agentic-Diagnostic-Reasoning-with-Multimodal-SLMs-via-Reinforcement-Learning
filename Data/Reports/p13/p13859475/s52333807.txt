                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia, tachycardia  // Evaluate for
 pulmonary infiltrate progression      Evaluate for pulmonary infiltrate
 progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are lower lung
 volumes.  Continued extensive opacification in the right mid and lower lung
 zones is again consistent with pneumonia.  Probably little overall change
 given the low lower lung volumes.
