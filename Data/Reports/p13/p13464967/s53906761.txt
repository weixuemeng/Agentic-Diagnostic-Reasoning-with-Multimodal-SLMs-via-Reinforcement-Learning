                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy with a pacer lead.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are low lung volumes
 which may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 A single-lead pacer device is in place with the tip in the region of the apex
 of the right ventricle.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
