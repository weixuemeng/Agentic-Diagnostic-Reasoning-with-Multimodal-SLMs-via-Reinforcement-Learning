                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Per the radiology technologist, the patient was unable to move left arm out of
 the way on the lateral view because of shoulder pain, thus making the
 evaluation of the lateral view is suboptimal.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture
 is seen in the chest.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal lateral view due to patient's overlying arm.  Otherwise, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
