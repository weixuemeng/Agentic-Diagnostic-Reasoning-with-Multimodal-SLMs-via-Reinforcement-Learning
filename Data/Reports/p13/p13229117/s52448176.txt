 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is within normal limits for technique.  Calcified lymph nodes are
 present in the right juxtahilar region.  Interval decrease in size of
 bilateral pleural effusions and improving adjacent basilar lung opacities,
 which most likely represent atelectasis, but coexisting infectious
 consolidation is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
