                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of sarcoid, new resp sx's  // Any
 evidence of a sarcoid flare?
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild septal thickening, scattered throughout the lungs, is unchanged over many
 years, and the decrease in pulmonary vascularity in the lower lungs, also
 long-standing suggests a component of emphysema. There is no new
 consolidation, nodulation, or scarring. Central lymph nodes are not enlarged
 and there is no pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
 
 It is conceivable that chest CT scanning would reveal findings not apparent on
 conventional radiographs.
