                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient diagnosed two days ago with right middle lobe
 pneumonia, with severe right-sided chest pain, radiates to the neck.
 
 COMPARISON: ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 along the right middle lobe is a large ovoid area of opacity, most likely
 representing right middle lobe pneumonia.  Alternatively, this could represent
 expanded fluid in the minor fissure.  There is persistent elevation of the
 anterior right hemidiaphragm.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right middle lobe opacity, similar in appearance to
 chest radiographs two days prior, pneumonia versus less likely fluid in
 expanded fissure.  Recommend followup to resolution.
