 INDICATION:  Patient with history of pneumonia.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___ and chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right middle lobe lung collapse and consolidation secondary to biopsy has
 improved.  There is still some residual linear opacitie that seems better on
 the lateral view than the exam done on ___.  The left lung is
 unremarkable except of a very small left basal atelectatic band.  The
 mediastinal and cardiac contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The changes secondary to lung biopsy in right middle lobe has improved. There
 is still some mild residual linear opacity.  A three-month chest x-ray
 followup is suggested.
