                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recent pneumonia, here to evaluate for
 resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show minimal interval
 improvement in wedge-shaped opacification of the right lung base projecting
 anteriorly over the heart on the corresponding lateral radiograph, which may
 represent partial right middle lobe collapse.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged and within normal limits.  Eventration of the right anterior
 hemidiaphragm is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved but persistent right middle lobe collapse, not fluid in
 the minor fissure.  A followup chest radiograph in four weeks is recommended
 to confirm resolution.  If opacification persists, a CT could be considered at
 that time for evaluation of the airway.
