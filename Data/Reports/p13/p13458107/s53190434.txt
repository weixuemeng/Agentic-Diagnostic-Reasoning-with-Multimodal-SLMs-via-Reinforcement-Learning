                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain status post bronch, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are low in volume with right middle lobe opacification,
 similar to the subsequently obtained chest CT.  This could be due to collapse,
 but superinfection or concomitant infection cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is seen on these images.  The heart is top normal in size with
 normal mediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe opacification as on subsequent CT could reflect
 collapse or pneumonia.
