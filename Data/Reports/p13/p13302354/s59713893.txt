                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypertension and presenting with dental
 abscess; unclear history of pulmonary disease. Recent echo showed no CHF. CTA
 with evidence of emphysema/fibrosis. Patient has new O2 requirement.  //
 Please assess for pulmonary edema    Please assess for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:17
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diminished lung volumes with diffuse bilateral interstitial reticular
 opacities correlating with the extensive parenchymal fibrosis seen on recent
 chest CT dated ___.  The fibrotic changes do not appear significantly
 changed but lower the ability to detect subtle abnormalities on plain
 radiography.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely not changed
 but again are difficult to assess due to the diffuse lung process. No large
 effusions. No pneumothorax.
