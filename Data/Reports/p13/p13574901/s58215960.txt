                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, lightheadedness yesterday.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle 7 mm
 rounded opacity projecting over the right lower lung is grossly stable as
 compared to the prior study and may relate to nipple shadow; however, suggest
 confirmation with repeat with nipple markers.  Otherwise, no focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle ovoid 7-8 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right
 lung base only seen along the frontal images, not on the other frontal images,
 most likely a nipple shadow or artifact, similar in appearance as compared to
 the prior study.  Similar size.  Findings can be further assessed with repeat
 with nipple markers.
