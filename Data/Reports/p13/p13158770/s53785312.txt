 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST

 AS.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The upper mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are associated with adjacent
 atelectasis.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 If clinical suspicion of aortic dissection persists, CTA is recommended.
