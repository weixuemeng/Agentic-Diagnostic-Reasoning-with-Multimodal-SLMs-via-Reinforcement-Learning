  Post-surgical changes with endotracheal tube tip at 3.0 cm from the carina
  (further retraction may be performed for optimal positioning, however the
  patient was already extubated at the time of the conversation with Dr. ___),
  Swan-Ganz catheter with tip likely in the right ventricle, New aortic valve,
  enlarged cardiac silhouette, prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
  bilateral mild atelectasis and minimal edema. Continued followup is
  recommended .

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:08 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man after CoreValve placement for aortic stenosis. 
 Check lines and tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary and mediastinal venous engorgement are new, since placement of the
 CoreValve, and there may be very mild edema at the lung bases.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion, but heart size, though top normal, has increased
 since the preprocedure study.  ET tube is in standard placement.  A line,
 probably a temporary pacer, traverses a right jugular introducer, and ends
 with its tip projecting over the mid portion of the cardiac silhouette.  This
 could be in the body of the right ventricle, as expected, but without a
 lateral view, I cannot be sure it is not in the coronary sinus.  Of note, the
 stomach is severely distended with air and fluid.
 
 Notification was withheld because subsequent chest radiograph showed reversal
 of important abnormalities.
