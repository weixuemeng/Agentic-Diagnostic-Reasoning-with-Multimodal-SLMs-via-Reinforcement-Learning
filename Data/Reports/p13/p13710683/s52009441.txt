 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 9:05
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever.  Evaluate for acute pulmonary
 process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:22.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 9:05 a.m. is just submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes are slightly low with linear opacity at the left base likely
 representing scarring.  Several calcified nodules in the left lung base likely
 reflect granulomas.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Right PICC line remains in
 place with its tip now in the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.
