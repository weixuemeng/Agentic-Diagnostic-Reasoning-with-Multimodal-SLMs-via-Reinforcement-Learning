                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post high-speed MVC 36 hours ago, car
 flipped and positive seatbelt sign note airbag.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Relatively low
 lung volumes are seen.  The lungs, however, are clear of focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  There is a mid-to-lower thoracic dextroscoliosis.  There is relative
 height loss at the left lateral aspect of the T10 vertebral body which is age
 indeterminant.  Osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided vertebral body height loss at the T10 vertebral body,
 age indeterminant.  If pain, additional cross-sectional imaging is suggested
 especially in setting of significant trauma.
