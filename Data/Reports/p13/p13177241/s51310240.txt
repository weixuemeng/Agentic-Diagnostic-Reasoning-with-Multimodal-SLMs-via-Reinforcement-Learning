                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are somewhat low, though allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  There is probable mild atelectasis
 in the lower lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  The
 bony structures appear intact.  No definite signs of free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.  Low lung volumes limits evaluation.
