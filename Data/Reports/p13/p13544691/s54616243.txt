 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent fevers, increasing white count, questionable new
 opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is still quite high and projects 6.6 cm above
 the carina on today's image.  The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  Lung
 volumes remain low.  The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the left lung bases with mild cardiomegaly but without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Unchanged appearance of the distended upper abdominal bowel
 loops.  No new parenchymal opacities.
