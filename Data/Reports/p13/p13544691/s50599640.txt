                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:22 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man, intubated.  Spiked fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Endotracheal tube partially withdrawn to the upper margin of the clavicles is
 no less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced 3 cm for more secure
 seating.
 
 Disparity in pulmonary vascular engorgement has worsened, left greater than
 right, but I see no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Mediastinal
 widening is exaggerated by exceedingly low lung volumes, but there may be
 elevated central venous pressure or volume.  Borderline cardiomegaly
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Hepatic flexure remains severely distended with gas.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 10:15 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
