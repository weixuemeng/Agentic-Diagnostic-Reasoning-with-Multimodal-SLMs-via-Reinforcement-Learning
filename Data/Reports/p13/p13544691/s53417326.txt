                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Extremely low lung volumes are
 noted.  Endotracheal tube is within 1 cm of the carina and should be
 withdrawn.  Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified.  There is focal opacity
 at the left costophrenic angle, potentially atelectasis given low lung
 volumes, although infection would also be possible or potentially effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube within 1 cm of the carina and should be
 withdrawn.
