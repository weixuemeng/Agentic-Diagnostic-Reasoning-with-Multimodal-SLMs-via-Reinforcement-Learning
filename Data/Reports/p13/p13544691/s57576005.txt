                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, for ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the
 endotracheal tube has been pushed forward, so that the tip lies approximately
 3.8 cm above the carina.  Continued low lung volumes with opacification at the
 left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with some combination of
 pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
 
 Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
