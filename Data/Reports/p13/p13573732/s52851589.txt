                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Question seizures status post MVC with frontal scalp
 avulsion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Overlying external
 artifact partially obscures the view.  Subtle left perihilar opacity may be
 related to overlying artifact, although underlying subtle consolidation due to
 contusion in the setting of trauma is not excluded.  The right lung appears
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overlying artifact partially obscures the view.  Subtle left
 perihilar opacity while could relate to external artifact, underlying
 consolidation due to contusion in the setting of trauma is not excluded. 
 Recommend dedicated PA and lateral views when the patient is able or frontal
 view of the chest without external artifact for further and better evaluation.
