                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening ascites and new shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval extubation since the radiograph from
 ___.  There has also been interval resolution of mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  A 5.8 x 4.6 cm fairly well circumscribed
 opacity in the left upper lung was not seen on the most recent radiograph from
 ___, possibly pulmonary hemorrhage, infection, or asymmetric
 residual edema.  A less conspicuous right upper lung opacity is likely of
 similar etiology.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New 5.8 cm opacity in the left upper lung and less conspicious
 right upper lung opacity, possibly pulmonary hemorrhage, infection, or
 residual edema.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:04 a.m. via
 telephone on the day of the study.
