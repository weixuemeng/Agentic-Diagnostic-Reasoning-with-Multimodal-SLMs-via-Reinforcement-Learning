 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after laminectomy,
 intubated with new NG tube and ET tube.

 AP chest radiograph.
 
 The ET tube tip is relatively low, approximately 1.2 cm above the carina and

 mediastinum are unchanged and shifted to the left due to the presence of
 severe dextroscoliosis.  Lungs are essentially clear.
