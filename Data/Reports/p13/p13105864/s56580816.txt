                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new trache  // confirm trache placement     
 confirm trache placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 5:00's
 8:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left tracheal wall and should be
 evaluated clinically to see if the tube is appropriately positioned. Feeding
 tube passes beyond the distal stomach and out of view.
 There is no mediastinal widening or appreciable pneumo mediastinum.
 
 Consolidation at both lung bases has worsened since earlier in the day,
 presumably but not definitively due to worsening atelectasis, since pneumonia
 was suspected on earlier examinations.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
