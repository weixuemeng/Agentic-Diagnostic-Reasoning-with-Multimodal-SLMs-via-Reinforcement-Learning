                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new HD line and Dobhoff. Please evaluate 2
 step Dobhoff.  // HD line placement and Dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  A right PICC line ends at the
 distal SVC. A right IJ line ends at the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff extends below the
 diaphragm and distal tip projects over the proximal stomach. Interval
 placement of a left hemodialysis catheter, which terminates in the proximal
 SVC.
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is worsened. Mild increase in
 bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, which likely represent atelectatic change
 and pulmonary edema. Volume loss and possibly pleural effusions are mildly
 worsened.
 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. A Dobbhoff extends below the diaphragm, however the distal tip coils back
 and points cranially suggesting that it is possibly in the distal esophagus.
 
 2. Interval placement of a left hemodialysis catheter, which terminates in the
 proximal SVC.
 
 3. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is unchanged.  Volume loss and
 bilateral pleural effusions are mildly worsened.
