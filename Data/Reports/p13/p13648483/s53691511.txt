                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough and fevers to 103, to rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiac size is normal.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal. Numerous poorly defined nodular opacities,
 and a few areas of confluent consolidations are seen in both lower lobes,
 lingula, right middle and upper lobes, with relative sparing of the left upper
 lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Widespread pulmonary opacities, with relative sparing of the left
 upper lobe, highly concerning for a multifocal pneumonia, such as mycoplasma
 or viral infection.  Other etiologies such as fungal infection, varicella, and
 opportunistic infections can be considered in the setting of travel to endemic
 areas or immunosuppression.  The above findings were discussed with Dr.
 ___ at 1:15 p.m. on ___.
