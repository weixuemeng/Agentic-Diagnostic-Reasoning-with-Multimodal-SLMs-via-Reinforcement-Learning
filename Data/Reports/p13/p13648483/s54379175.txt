                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation of interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement in extent and severity of the pre-existing predominantly
 micronodular and interstitial parenchymal opacities.  However, on today's
 radiograph, the opacities are still clearly visible and are not yet resolved. 
 An area of slightly increased lung density in the lateral aspects of the right
 upper lobe also persists.
 
 There is no evidence of complications such as abscess or pleural effusions. 
 No adenopathy.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
 
 Further radiographic followup is required until complete resolution.
