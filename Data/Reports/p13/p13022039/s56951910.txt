                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is persistent
 substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  However, the pulmonary
 vessels show only minimal engorgement at this time.  Much of the interstitial
 changes could reflect chronic pulmonary disease as well.
 
 Several calcified granuloma are again seen.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.
