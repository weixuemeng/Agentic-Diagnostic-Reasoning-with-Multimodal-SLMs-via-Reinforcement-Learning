                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 Radiograph centered near the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for the
 purposes of assessing a nasogastric tube placement, with tip of tube
 visualized in the proximal stomach, but side port not confidently visualized
 and likely proximal to the GE junction level.  Interval extubation, but
 otherwise no relevant short interval change in the appearance of the chest
 since the recent radiograph of one day earlier.
