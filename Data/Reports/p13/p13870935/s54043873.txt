                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Rhonchorous breath sounds on right.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable view of the chest was obtained.  Dual-lead left-sided
 pacer device is again seen in stable position.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There is a hazy opacity at the lung bases, which may
 in part, relate to overlying soft tissue, but underlying consolidation due to
 infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 Bilateral pleural plaques are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively low lung volumes.  Bibasilar haziness may, in part,
 relate to overlying soft tissue, but underlying consolidation due to infection
 or aspiration is not excluded.
