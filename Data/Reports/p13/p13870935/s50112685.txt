                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION: ___-year-old male with history of dyspnea on exertion,
 hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of previously seen right-sided PICC.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacer is again seen, unchanged in position, with leads in expected
 positions of the right atrium and ventricle.  Bilateral calcified pleural and
 diaphragmatic plaques are again seen.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta remains calcified
 and tortuous.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Overall, given differences
 in inspiration and technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
