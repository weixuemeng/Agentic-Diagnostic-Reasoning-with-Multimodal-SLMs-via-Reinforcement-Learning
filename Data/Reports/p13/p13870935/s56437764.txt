                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CHF, delirium and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is at least mild to moderately enlarged.  Lung
 volumes are low with increased bibasilar opacities, particularly with a new
 peripheral right lower lobe opacity that is likely atelectatic.  There is a
 right-sided pleural effusion.  A left pectoral pacer is placed with unchanged
 position of leads.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 opacities with peripheral right lower lobe opacity which is likely
 atelectatic, however, infection cannot be excluded given the appropriate
 clinical setting.
