                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker/AICD device is noted with leads terminating
 in right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart remains mild to moderately
 enlarged, and the aorta is tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema,
 relatively unchanged from the prior exam.  Calcified pleural plaque projecting
 over the left upper lobe is re- demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, are noted, appearing decreased in size
 compared to the prior exam.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and slightly decreased small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
