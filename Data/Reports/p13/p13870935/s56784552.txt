                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, scattered radiation related
 to the size of the patient greatly obscures detail.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains substantially enlarged, though there does not appear to be appreciable
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  This discordance raises the possibility of
 pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.  The area of increased opacification
 in the left upper zone laterally has been present at least since ___ and
 represents a chronic process.
