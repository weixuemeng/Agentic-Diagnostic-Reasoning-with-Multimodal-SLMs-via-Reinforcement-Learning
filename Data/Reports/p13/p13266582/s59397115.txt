                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with new fever, suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate-sized hiatus hernia is larger.  There is no good evidence for
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion is new and the pulmonary vasculature
 is more engorged, but I don't see pulmonary edema.  Loops of bowel interposed
 between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm should not be mistaken for
 pneumoperitoneum.
