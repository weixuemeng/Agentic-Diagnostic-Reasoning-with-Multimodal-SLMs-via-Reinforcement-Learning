                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall/syncope with L forehead hematoma //
 r/o fx, ICH, occult infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Round 10
 mm density in the left lower lobe corresponds to a known pulmonary nodule.
 There are smaller diffuse nodularities which likely reflect additional
 pulmonary nodules, better assessed on prior chest CT examination.  There is no
 new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules, better assessed on prior dedicated chest CT
 examination.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
