                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
