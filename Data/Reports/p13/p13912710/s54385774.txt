 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:41 PM
  Newly placed nasoenteric tube tip enters the proximal stomach with the side
  port at the GE junction tube can be advanced at least 11 cm if desired
  position of the side port is within the stomach.  There has been minimal
  improvement in diffuse lung opacities compared to the most recent prior
  radiograph.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with with liver failure  // NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Serial chest radiographs, most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  A right-sided
 internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip terminates in the distal SVC.  A
 nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the side port is at approximately the level the
 gastroesophageal junction and this could be advanced further into the stomach.
 There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities in a predominately perihilar
 distribution consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is silhouetting of the
 right hemidiaphragm, unchanged compared to the prior study.  This may reflect
 atelectasis or consolidation.  Similar appearance in the left lower lobe. 
 Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The side port for the nasogastric tube is positioned at approximately the
 gastroesophageal junction, this could be advanced further into the stomach.
 
 Findings consistent with pulmonary edema, pleural effusions and atelectasis. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
