                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Linear opacities at
 the lung bases, right greater than left are most suggestive of atelectasis. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Hypertrophic changes seen in the spine, osseous and soft
 tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities at the lung base most suggestive of atelectasis;
 however, if high clinical concern, repeat exam with PA and lateral is
 suggested to further characterize.
