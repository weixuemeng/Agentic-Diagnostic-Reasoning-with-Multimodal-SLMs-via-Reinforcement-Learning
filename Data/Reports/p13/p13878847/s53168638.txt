                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GI bleed s/p CVL placement at ___.  //
 confirm IJ placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated in ___ at 00:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 hours prior, there is been
 interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous catheter which terminates
 near the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  An enteric tube
 terminates within the gastric body.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis, although there is some asymmetry with increased opacification at
 the left base and a small pleural effusion, possibly suggesting the presence
 of a pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is mildly increased, but without pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes
 are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left-sided central venous catheter terminates at the junction of the SVC and
 left brachiocephalic vein.  Minimally increased bibasilar atelectasis or
 alternatively a developing pneumonia.
