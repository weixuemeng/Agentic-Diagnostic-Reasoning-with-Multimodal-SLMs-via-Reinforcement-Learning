 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, obstipation, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  No focal infiltrate or
 effusion is identified.  There is atelectasis at the left base.  Note is made
 of a small-to-moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
