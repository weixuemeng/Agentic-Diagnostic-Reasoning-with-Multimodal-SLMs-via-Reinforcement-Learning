                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with back pain, interstitial lung disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Coarse
 interstitial opacities with associated hazy opacification are predominantly in
 a peripheral and basilar distribution, more so on the right than on the left.
 These findings appear more pronounced when compared to the previous
 radiograph.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Hilar contours are stable.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No new focal consolidation is
 definitively seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease with a fibrotic
 component, progressed when compared to the previous exam.
