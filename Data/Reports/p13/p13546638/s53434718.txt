                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diastolic CHF and PVD s/p mechanical fall 
 // evidence of pulmonary edema, interval change      evidence of pulmonary
 edema, interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 10:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 12:27 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left-sided pacer remains in place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy.  There are
 small bilateral layering effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, left
 greater than right, suggestive of atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  The interstitium is prominent which may reflect stable mild
 edema or chronic interstitial changes. Comparison to more remote studies would
 be helpful.  No pneumothorax. Aortic calcification consistent with
 atherosclerosis. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with no acute bony
 abnormality appreciated.
