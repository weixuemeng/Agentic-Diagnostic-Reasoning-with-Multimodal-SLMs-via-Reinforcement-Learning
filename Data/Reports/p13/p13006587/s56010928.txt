                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, fever, and knee pain.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Linear opacity overlying the lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies on lateral view is most compatible with atelectasis,
 but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No diffuse
 pulmonary abnormality is present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky linear opacity overlying the lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies, most compatible with atelectasis, although atypical pneumonia cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
