                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post MVC with T-spine tenderness.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hilar contours, pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Mild anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body is better
 evaluated on concurrent T-spine radiograph. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Mild anterior wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body is redemonstrated
 and better evaluated on concurrent T-spine.
