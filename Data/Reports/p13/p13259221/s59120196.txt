 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:14 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pancreatitis, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 12:56.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:14 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip
 in the distal SVC.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable.  There has been interval decrease in lung volumes with appearance of a
 left basilar linear opacity and patchy opacity at the right medial lung base
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is possibly a tiny left effusion.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Previously described
 left-sided old rib fractures are less well seen on the current examination.
