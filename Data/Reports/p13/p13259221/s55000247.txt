                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, question acute pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the left-sided PICC line has been removed.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone re-distribution, without overt
 CHF. Minimal atelectasis at the right base is again noted, slightly improved. 
 No focal infiltrate is detected.  No gross effusion is detected.  Minimal
 blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle is noted. Slight
 eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is probably unchanged.  Hyperinflation
 and flattened diaphragms suggest background COPD.  Nodular density seen
 adjacent to the hilum on the lateral view most likely represents a vessel seen
 on end.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Minimal blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle consistent with
 minimal pleural fluid and/or thickening.  
 2) Minimal atelectasis, right base, improved.  
 3) Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
