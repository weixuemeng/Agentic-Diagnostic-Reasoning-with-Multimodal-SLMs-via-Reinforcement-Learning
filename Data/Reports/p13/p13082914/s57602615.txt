                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular
 predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with mild
 calcification of the aortic knob.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 There has been slight interval improvement in aeration of the left lung base,
 with minimal residual streaky opacities in both lower lung bases likely
 reflecting atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine along with a mild to
 moderate dextroscoliosis.  Humeral prosthesis on the right is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval improvement in aeration of the left lung base with persistent
 residual patchy opacities at the lung bases which could reflect atelectasis. 
 Infection or aspiration is not completely excluded.
