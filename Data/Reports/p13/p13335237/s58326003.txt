                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated and sedated after acute lung injury, assess ET tube
 position.
 
 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL HISTORY PROVIDED:  Patient developed shortness of breath
 and coded prior to admission after receiving blood transfusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph one day prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube courses into the stomach and out of view.  Diffuse bilateral airspace
 opacities are increased at the bases with relative decrease in the previously
 described perihilar component.  Given the migration of the opacities, edema is
 favored. Heart size is normal suggesting noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, a
 finding which can be seen in major and minor transfusion reactions.
