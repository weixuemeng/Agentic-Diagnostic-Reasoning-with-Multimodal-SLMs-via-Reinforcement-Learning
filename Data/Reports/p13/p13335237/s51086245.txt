 HISTORY:  Recent intubation, check OGT placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning. 
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  An OG-type tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the
 film.  Again seen is a right IJ central line. tip over distal SVC.   
 
 Upper zone redistribution and extensive pulmonary opacities are overall
 similar to earlier the same day. Allowing for obliquity, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  OG-type tube extending beneath diaphragm, off the film.
