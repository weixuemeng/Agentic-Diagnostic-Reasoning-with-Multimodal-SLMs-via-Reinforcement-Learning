 Generalized pulmonary opacification has worsened.  Heart size is normal to
 increased slightly, and similarly mediastinal veins previously collapsed are
 now normal caliber.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large.  Despite a
 nasogastric tube passing into the stomach and out of view, there is severe

 pulmonary edema improved on the subsequent chest radiograph 10:11 a.m.
