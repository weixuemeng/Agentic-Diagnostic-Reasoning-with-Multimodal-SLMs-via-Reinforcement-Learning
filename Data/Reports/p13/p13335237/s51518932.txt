                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath
 and low oxygen saturation, infectious vs. fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of
 the carina.  There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with a relative
 perihilar distribution, most suggestive of pulmonary edema, however, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed infection is not excluded.  There
 is minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles which could relate to trace
 effusions or pleural thickening.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The
 aortic arch is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities in a relative perihilar distribution
 suggest pulmonary edema; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
