                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung cancer, increasing dyspnea and chest pain,
 cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of a
 moderate left pleural effusion which appears increased in size compared to the
 previous chest radiograph. Left hilar and infrahilar masses as well as the
 left upper lobe mass are grossly unchanged compared to the recent chest CT.
 Left basilar opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis but infection is
 difficult to exclude.  Chain sutures within the right upper lobe are re-
 demonstrated. The aorta is tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No
 pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is demonstrated. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of left pleural effusion, now moderate, with left basilar
 opacity which may reflect compressive atelectasis. Infection within the left
 lung base cannot be completely excluded. Grossly unchanged appearance of left
 upper lobe, left hilar and left infrahilar masses compared to the previous CT.
