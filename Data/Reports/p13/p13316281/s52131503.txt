                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CTA chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour remains
 unchanged.  Left upper lobe rounded opacity remains unchanged, previously
 characterized as an area of radiation fibrosis with probable recurrent tumor. 
 Left perihilar mass appears similar compared to the previous exams with
 associated left hilar lymphadenopathy.  Again demonstrated is a small to
 moderate pleural effusion which is partially loculated towards the apex, not
 substantially changed in the interval with continued left basilar chest tube
 in place.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Small right pleural effusion is a
 little changed in the interval.  Increased interstitial opacities bilaterally,
 most pronounced at the bases may reflect mild pulmonary edema and/ or
 lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity could reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  Mild S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 re- demonstrated.  Fusion hardware within the lumbar spine is incompletely
 imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Overall little interval change in the appearance of the chest compared to
 the recent radiographic exam.
 2. Persistent left upper lobe rounded opacity a reflective of radiation
 fibrosis with probable recurrent tumor.
 3. Continued left perihilar opacity compatible with malignancy.
 4. Persistent interstitial opacities within the lung bases may reflect mild
 pulmonary edema but lymphangitic carcinomatosis remains in the differential.
 5. Small to moderate partially loculated left pleural effusion and trace right
 pleural effusions, unchanged with left basilar chest tube in place.
 6. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
