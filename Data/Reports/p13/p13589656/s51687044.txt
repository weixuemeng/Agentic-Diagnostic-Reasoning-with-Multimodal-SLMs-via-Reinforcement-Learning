                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest burning.  Neurostimulator placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Bilateral
 neurostimulator devices over the chest obscure significant portion of the
 lungs.  That said, the lungs where seen are clear.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is resorption of
 the distal right clavicle and orthopedic screws projecting over the glenoid
 suggesting that these changes may all be post-operative.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
