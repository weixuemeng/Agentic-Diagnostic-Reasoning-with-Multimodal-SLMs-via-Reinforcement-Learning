                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malaise.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms,
 which can be seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is mild
 left base atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  No overt pulmonary edema
 is seen.  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.  A drain is partially imaged
 overlying the upper abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild left base atelectasis.  Hyperinflated lungs suggests chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation.  Top normal to mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette.
