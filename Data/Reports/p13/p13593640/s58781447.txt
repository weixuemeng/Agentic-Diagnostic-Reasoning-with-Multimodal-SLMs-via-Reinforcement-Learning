                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is extreme kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine as
 seen on previous lateral views of the chest.  Extreme kyphotic angulation
 severe limits evaluation with first image displaying en face projection of the
 lumen of the trachea.  Within this limitation, there is increased bibasilar
 consolidation compared to yesterday's examination, worrisome for pneumonia. 
 There is likely associated bilateral pleural effusion.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is difficult to evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing bibasilar consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
