                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP frontal portable view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is
 rotated to the left and is likely kyphotic in position.  Due to patient
 positioning, the examination is quite suboptimal.  There are patchy bibasilar
 opacities, which could relate to atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is
 difficult to exclude.  It is also difficult to exclude small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  Mediastinal contours are difficult
 to assess due to patient positioning.  Cardiac silhouette appears mildly
 enlarged.  There are low lung volumes.  Also, the right humeral head appears
 subluxed in relation to the right glenoid, not optimally evaluated on this
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to patient positioning.  Recommend repeat
 with better patient positioning for better evaluation.  Grossly, bibasilar
 opacities are seen, which could be due to atelectasis, however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded. 
 
 Right humeral head appears subluxed in relation to the right glenoid, not
 optimally evaluated on this study.
