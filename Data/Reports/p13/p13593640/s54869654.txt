                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rales and dyspnea, to assess for pneumothorax or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison with study of ___, there are very low lung volumes
 with severe kyphosis of the thoracic spine that appears even more prominent
 than on the previous study.  There is some increased opacification at the left
 base that could well be merely atelectatic change.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
