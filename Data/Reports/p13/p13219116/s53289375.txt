                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the frontal view, there is a subtle opacity overlying the right
 sixth rib.  This is more prominent than on the prior exam.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without a focal opacity or pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity overlying the right sixth rib.  This is uncertain
 if it is within the pulmonary parenchyma or a deformity of the rib.  Recommend
 a repeat PA view of the chest and shallow obliques for further
 characterization.
 
 Results were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:30 p.m. on ___ via telephone by
 Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
