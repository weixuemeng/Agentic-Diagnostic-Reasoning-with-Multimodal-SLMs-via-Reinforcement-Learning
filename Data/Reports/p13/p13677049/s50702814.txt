                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy
 complicated by intra-op asystole at time of insufflation requiring chest
 compressions with nearly immediate return of sinus rhythm, now extubated and
 stable  // ?pneumothorax ?rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is dense airspace consolidation in the left mid upper lung which could
 represent aspiration go given history of intraoperative arrest with chest
 compressions, the possibility of contusion secondary to chest compression is
 also considered. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. No pneumothorax is seen.
 The heart and mediastinal contour appears normal. No displaced rib fractures
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dense consolidation in the left mid upper lung is concerning for aspiration
 versus contusion in the setting of chest compression.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed by phone with Dr. ___ ___
 and Dr. ___ ___ at the time of this dictation.
