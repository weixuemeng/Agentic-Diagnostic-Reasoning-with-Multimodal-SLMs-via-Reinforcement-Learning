                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary hypertension, evaluate new line
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple (8) sequential supine AP chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 21:54.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC is re-identified with tip projecting over the mid SVC, unchanged. 
 EKG leads over the chest.  Sequential radiographs demonstrate repositioning of
 a newly inserted right IJ Swan-Ganz/PA catheter.  Final image demonstrates the
 tip projecting over the expected location of the right lower lobar pulmonary
 artery.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and within normal limits.  The hila
 are unremarkable.  There is central prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting elevated pulmonary vascular pressures, with unchanged pulmonary
 interstitial edema.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New Swan-Ganz catheter with final tip position projecting over the expected
 location of the right lower lobar pulmonary artery.
 2. Unchanged pulmonary interstitial edema.
