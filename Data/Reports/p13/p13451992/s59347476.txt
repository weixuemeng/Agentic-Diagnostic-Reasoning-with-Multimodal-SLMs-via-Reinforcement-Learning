                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pulmonary hypertension with worsening hypoxia,
 concern for worsening pulmonary hypertension, CHF exacerbation, cor pulmonale
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution ___, CT
 chest from outside hospital ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly enlarged compared to the previous
 radiograph.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Enlargement of the hila
 bilaterally is compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Lungs are hyperinflated with marked
 emphysematous changes again noted.  Increased interstitial markings are noted
 along the periphery and lung bases suggestive of a mild chronic interstitial
 abnormality.  Patchy opacities the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly, slightly increased compared to the previous radiograph,
 without pulmonary edema.
 2. Enlargement of the hila, as seen previously, compatible with history of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 3. Hyperinflated lungs with marked emphysema and mild chronic interstitial
 abnormality.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
