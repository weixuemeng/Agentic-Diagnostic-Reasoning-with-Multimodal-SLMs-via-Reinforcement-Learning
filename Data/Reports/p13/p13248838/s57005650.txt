                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No prior images.  There is opacification at the left base obscuring
 the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle.  This is consistent with the
 atelectasis seen on recent CT scan.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
 
 Otherwise, essentially within normal limits.
