                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male in a motor vehicle accident.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The trauma board overlies the patient and somewhat obscures the
 film.  With this in mind, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  There is no pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
