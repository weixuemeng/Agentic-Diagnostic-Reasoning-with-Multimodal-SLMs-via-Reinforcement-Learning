                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with 2 day CP, cough  // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Streaky retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis versus an early pneumonia in the correct clinical
 setting.  Otherwise the lungs are clear.  No large effusion is seen.  No
 pneumothorax.  No signs of congestion or edema.  The heart appears top-normal
 in size.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Top normal heart size, retrocardiac streaky opacity, likely atelectasis,
 difficult to exclude an early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
