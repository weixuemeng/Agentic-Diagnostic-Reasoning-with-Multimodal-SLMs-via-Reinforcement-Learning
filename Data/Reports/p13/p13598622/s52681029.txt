                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with R chest pain  // r/o pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Mild bibasilar atelectasis is
 noted. There is a nodular opacity at the left lateral lung base which is most
 suggestive of atelectasis. An adjacent smaller nodular opacities stable from
 multiple prior exams. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. No findings
 to suggest pneumonia or edema. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis with more nodular opacity in the left lung base
 which may represent atelectasis though short interval radiographic followup is
 needed to ensure resolution.
