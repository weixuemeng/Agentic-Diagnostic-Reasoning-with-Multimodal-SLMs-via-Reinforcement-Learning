                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with c/o dyspnea and chills  // ? aspiration PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
 Given this, no large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is subtle right
 upper lobe opacity which may be artifactual with underlying emphysema although
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
