                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with T2DM, HFpEF, presenting with  shortness of
 breath// Evaluate for pulmonary edema vs pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged, as seen
 previously.  The mediastinal contour is similar.  Hilar contours are
 relatively unchanged with no evidence for pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity in
 the right lung base likely reflects an area of atelectasis, but infection is
 not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Minimal atelectasis is also
 noted in the retrocardiac region.  There may be a trace right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified, though assessment of the medial
 aspect of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's chin overlying
 this area.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacity in the right lung base, likely
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.  Chronic elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.
