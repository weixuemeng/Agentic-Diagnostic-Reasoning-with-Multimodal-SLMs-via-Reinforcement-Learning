                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung
 volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity partially obscures left hemidiaphragm.  Left
 costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusion.  The
 right lung is clear.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity, may represent atelectasis or infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
