                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, question infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  There is a
 large retrocardiac opacity containing air-fluid level compatible with a large
 hiatal hernia.  Previously noted cavitary lesion within the right upper lobe
 is slightly less conspicuous than on prior exam.  Additional areas of
 nodularity in the right mid lung are stable from multiple prior exams dating
 back to a CT of the chest from ___.  There is no evidence of aspiration. 
 Bony structures are intact.  High-riding right humeral head could indicate
 chronic right rotator cuff disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia.  Right upper lobe cavitary lesion, similar
 to prior with areas of nodularity in the right mid lung, also stable from
 multiple prior exams.  Consider CT on a non-emergent basis to further assess
 given that the most recent prior exam dates back to ___ to ensure stability
 of aforementioned nodules.
