                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post subxiphoid pericardial
 window.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Study obtained in
 PACU.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Apparently
 the patient is now status post pericardiocentesis via surgically performed
 placement.  A catheter from below can be identified is overlying the right
 lower heart shadow.  Comparison with the previous study paying attention to
 differences in patient position, the heart size has decreased markedly and the
 previously identified so-called " water bottle configuration" has been
 replaced by a more normal appearance.  Particular right-sided prominence of
 the heart shadow is markedly reduced.  As the present examination does not
 include a lateral view.  The previously identified displacement of the
 subepicardial fat line,a conclusive sign for pericardial effusion, cannot be
 commented upon.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion can be identified.
