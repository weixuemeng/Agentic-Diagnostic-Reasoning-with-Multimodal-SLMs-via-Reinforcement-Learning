                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left side wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is extremely tortuous, unchanged since the
 prior study with no evidence of focal dilatation.  Nodular opacity seen on the
 prior radiograph on ___ appears to be less dense and most likely
 reflects residua of prior inflammation.  There are no new nodules, masses or
 consolidations.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Reevaluation of
 the patient in three months for documentation of complete resolution of the
 left upper lung nodular opacity is recommended with chest radiograph.
