                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Encephalopathy in complete heart block, status post new femoral
 pacing wire. Check pacing wire placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Intraoperative fluoroscopy from ___. Chest
 radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior exam, a new femoral pacing wire has been placed, and is in its
 expected location overlying the right ventricle.  An opacity at the left base
 suggests atelectasis and a possible pleural effusion, similar to the prior
 exam. There is also likely a small right pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary
 edema is similar.  There is no focal opacity. No pneumothorax is identified.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with moderate cardiomegaly. A
 right PICC is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New femoral pacing wire in satisfactory position.
 2. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema and probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
