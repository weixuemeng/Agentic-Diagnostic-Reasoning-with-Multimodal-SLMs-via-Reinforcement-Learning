                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with orophyaryngeal bleeding s/p hemostassis with
 new hypotension and leukocytosis  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left pectoral pacemaker is in place.  The chin and overlying soft tissues
 partially obscures lung apices.  There is no obvious pneumothorax.  Aside from
 minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs are clear. A rounded
 left infrahilar contour is new, and may be due to left hilar adenopathy, an
 enlarged left atrium, or a new descending aortic aneurysm.  A small left
 pleural effusion and left basilar subsegmental atelectasis have decreased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded left infrahilar contour may be due to new adenopathy, an enlarged left
 atrium, or a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.  A contrast-enhanced chest
 CT is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Decreased small left pleural effusion and left basilar subsegmental
 atelectasis.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to evaluate new rounded left infrahilar contour.
