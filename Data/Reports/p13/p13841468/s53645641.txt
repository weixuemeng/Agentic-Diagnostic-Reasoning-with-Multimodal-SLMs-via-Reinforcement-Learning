 As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube
 remains normal.  The tip is very difficult to visualize but projects over the

 pre-existing mild to moderate pulmonary edema, the small left pleural effusion
 as well as the retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged in appearance.
