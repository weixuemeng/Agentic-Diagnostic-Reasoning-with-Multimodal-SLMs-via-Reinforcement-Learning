                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest discomfort.  Evaluate for evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Coronary artery calcifications are seen along the
 course of the LAD in the lateral view. Aortic valve calcifications might be
 present as well.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Possible aortic
 valve calcifications raise concern for valvular disease. Clinical exam is
 recommended to assess for evidence of aortic stenosis.
