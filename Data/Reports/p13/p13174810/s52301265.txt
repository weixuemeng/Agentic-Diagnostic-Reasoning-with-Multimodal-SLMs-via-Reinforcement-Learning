                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy and new NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small left apical pneumothorax. There has been interval
 placement of an NG tube, the tip of which projects over the expected position
 of the body of the stomach.  A second NG tube, tracheostomy tube, right upper
 extremity PICC, left chest tube, right chest tube are unchanged, and in
 expected position.  Median sternotomy wires, surgical ___, and clips
 superimposed upon the right lung apex are again noted.  IVC filter is
 partially visualized.  Airspace opacity, right greater than left is not
 significantly changed and may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left apical pneumothorax; left chest tube unchanged in position.
 
 2.  Interval NG tube placement, the tip of which is superimposed upon the
 expected position of the stomach.
 
 3.  Stable airspace opacity, right greater than left, atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.
