                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Trauma, intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___ and ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Mediastinal silhouette is stable.  Previously
 visualized left pneumothorax is not seen in the current study.  ET tube is in
 a standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC.  Right chest
 tube is in unchanged position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Multiple
 surgical clips project in the right upper and mid thorax.  Left apical chest
 tube is present.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, and right
 upper lobe peripheral opacity are unchanged.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities or increasing pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Opacity in the right upper lobe at the periphery is located in the previously
 seen pulmonary laceration.  lower lobe opacities could correspond to
 atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
