                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with E.coli sepsis of undetermined etiology,
 treated for HCAP, now with SOB not responding to bronchodilators or diuresis 
 // r/o infiltrate, effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present. Worsening opacity at right lung base could potentially represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Improving left basilar opacity
 favors atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
