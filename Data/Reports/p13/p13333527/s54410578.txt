                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with past history significant for diastolic
 congestive heart failure, hypertension, bilateral PE, pericardial effusion,
 and pulmonary and hepatic metastases.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube and right IJ central venous line are in appropriate position.  The
 gastric tube ends outside the view of this radiograph.  The bilateral hilar
 continue to be enlarged secondary to known lymphadenopathy as seen on CT scan.
 Lung volumes continue to be low, and the left hemidiaphragm is obscured
 secondary to volume loss.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.  Continued low lung volumes.
