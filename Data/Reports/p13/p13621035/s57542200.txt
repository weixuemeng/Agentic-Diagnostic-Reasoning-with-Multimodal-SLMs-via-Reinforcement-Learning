                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 HISTORY:  Left arm swelling and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Projecting over the right upper lung is a questionable
 nodular opacity, a possible lung nodule.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are
 present along the mid thoracic levels.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Equivocal finding in the right
 upper lobe, namely a possible nodule.  Chest CT is suggested to investigate
 further when clinically appropriate unless prior radiographs are available to
 show long-term stability of this appearance.
