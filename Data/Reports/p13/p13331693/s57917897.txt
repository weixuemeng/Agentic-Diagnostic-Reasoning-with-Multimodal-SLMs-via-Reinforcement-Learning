 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Near the cardiophrenic angle on the left, there are streaky opacities which
 are somewhat linear in nature and most likely represent atelectasis or
 scarring, however, infection cannot be ruled out, particular in the correct
 clinical setting. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The patient is status post right
 axillary dissection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left lower lobe opacities, likely atelectasis or scarring, but early
 infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
