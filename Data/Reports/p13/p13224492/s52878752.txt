                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p intubation  // eval ETT position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable radiograph the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric
 tube courses through the esophagus, with an abnormal curvature to the left,
 within a moderate-sized retrocardiac hiatal hernia.  The mediastinum and heart
 are shifted to the left due to volume loss and collapse of the left lower
 lobe.  Left midlung linear atelectasis is noted, along with a layering left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. The right lung is grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse, with mediastinal shift, and elevated left hilus
 likely in part due to moderate hiatal hernia. Left pleural effusion and linear
 atelectasis.
