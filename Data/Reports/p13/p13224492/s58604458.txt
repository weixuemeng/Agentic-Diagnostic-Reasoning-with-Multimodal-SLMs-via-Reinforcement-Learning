 The heart is normal in size.  There is a new moderate sized hiatal hernia with
 streaky opacities in the left lower lobe which can probably be attributed to

 effusion.  Although a small portion of the right costophrenic sulcus is
 excluded, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right side.  There
 is no free air.
