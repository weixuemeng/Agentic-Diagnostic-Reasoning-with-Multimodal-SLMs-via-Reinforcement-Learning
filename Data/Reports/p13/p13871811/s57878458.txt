                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously reported right lower lobe opacity has markedly
 progressed, now involving the mid and lower lung regions and most confluent in
 the juxtahilar area.  These findings could reflect an evolving pneumonia given
 clinical suspicion for this entity.  Dense left retrocardiac opacity favors a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion, but a co-existing pneumonia is also
 possible in this region.  Veil-like opacity in mid and lower right hemithorax
 likely reflects layering pleural effusion on this semi-upright radiograph.
