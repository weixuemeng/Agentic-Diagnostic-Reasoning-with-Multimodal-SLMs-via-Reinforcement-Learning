                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with COPD s/p recent fall with leg laceration
 going to the operating room, evaluate for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The hila are
 unremarkable.  Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects
 superimposed/overlying soft tissue.  There is no focal lung consolidation. 
 There is likely minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of a displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture.  Note, chest
 radiography is not sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib
 fractures.
