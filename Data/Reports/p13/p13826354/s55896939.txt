                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  There is moderate unfolding and
 calcification along the thoracic aorta.  Streaky retrocardiac opacities,
 probably refering to the left lower lobe, obscure the contour of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Small anterior osteophytes are present throughout
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky basilar opacities, more suggestive of atelectasis than
 infection.  If pulmonary symptoms concerning for pneumonia are present,
 however, then short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful.  Developing
 infection is not excluded.
