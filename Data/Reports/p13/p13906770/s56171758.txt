                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, near-syncope, history of ablation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.
