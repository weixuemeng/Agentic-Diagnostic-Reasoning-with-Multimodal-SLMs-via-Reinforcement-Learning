                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bullous disease status post right VATS and
 bullectomy and pleurodesis, right chest tube in place, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___ as well as
 multiple prior studies.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right chest tube in place.  There is no apical
 pneumothorax however, difficult to evaluate the bases due to known bullous
 disease.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the right lateral chest wall. 
 Linear opacities at the left base are most likely atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left chest tube.  No pneumothorax, however,
 difficult to assess the bases due to bullous disease.  Left basilar
 atelectasis.
