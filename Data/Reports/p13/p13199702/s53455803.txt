 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  Evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided chest tube
 has been removed.  There are minimal air-fluid levels at the right lung bases,
 suggesting presence of small amounts of intrapleural air.  However, no
 apicolateral pneumothorax is seen.  No left-sided pneumothorax.  No
 diaphragmatic depression.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
