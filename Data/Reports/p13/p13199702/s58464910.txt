                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with possible right pneumothorax, here to
 evaluate for pneumothorax and complications.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a moderate-sized
 right basal pneumothorax with slight leftward shift of the mediastinal
 structures and associated collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower
 lobe.  Suture chains are noted in the left lung base consistent with prior
 surgery.  The lungs appear hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and
 increased AP diameter of the chest suggesting underlying COPD/emphysema. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged and no pulmonary edema is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right basal pneumothorax with leftward shift of the
 mediastinum and right basilar collapse in the setting of COPD/emphysema
 suggests a spontaneous secondary pneumothorax.
