                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with bullous lung disease, status post
 right-sided blebectomy, pleurodesis, now on water seal for pneumothorax. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day.  The right-sided
 chest tube remains in unchanged position and terminates in the right apical
 area.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The previously identified bilateral
 basal atelectases remain rather unchanged.  Comparison does not demonstrate
 new infiltrates.  No mediastinal shift and no evidence of increase in pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings with right chest tube in place, no interval
 change for the last six hours.
