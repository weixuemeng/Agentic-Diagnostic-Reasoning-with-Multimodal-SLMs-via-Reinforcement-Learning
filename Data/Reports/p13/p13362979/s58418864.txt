 INDICATION:  History: ___M with diplopia. CXR requested by neuro

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged. Minimal streaky atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. There is mild
 blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly which could suggest trace
 bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen. There are mild to moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly suggests trace bilateral
 pleural effusions. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
