                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are underinflated, resulting
 in crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  The heart size is top normal. 
 The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  No definite
 consolidation is seen.  The central pulmonary vessels are prominent; however,
 no overt edema is detected.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Study limited by poor inspiratory effort; no acute intrathoracic
 process.
