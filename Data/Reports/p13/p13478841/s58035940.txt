                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall and head strike.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.
 
 As on prior, low lung volumes are seen.  Linear bibasilar opacities are most
 suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no large confluent consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially stable as are the osseous and
 soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this limited
 exam due to poor inspiratory effort.
