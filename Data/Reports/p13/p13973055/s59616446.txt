  ETT approximately 7 cm above the carina. OG tube within the stomach. There are
  diffusely increased interstitial markings and ___ B-lines combined with
  diffuse airspace opacities consistent with moderate interstitial and alveolar
  pulmonary edema. Given the normal heart size and lack of pleural effusions,
  noncardiogenic etiologies such as ARDS should be considered. Diffuse alveolar
  hemorrhage may present similarly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure, s/p cardiac arrest  // eval
 for CVL, ETT placement      eval for CVL, ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 right IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 7.3 cm above the carina and a
 nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach. Again there is
 evidence of pulmonary edema without pleural effusions. In view of the normal
 size of the heart, noncardiogenic edema should be considered. The pattern
 could also represent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
