                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiogenic shock.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  An ET tube is present, in satisfactory
 position approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip
 beneath diaphragm overlying stomach. Right IJ central line is present, tip at
 SVC/RA junction.  An additional central line extends from below, presumably
 via femoral approach, and overlies the main pulmonary artery.  
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is also atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  No gross effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular plethora, without overt
 CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position.
