 FINDINGS: 
 
 1 AP view. There is evidence for increased density in the retrocardiac area in
 the left hemidiaphragm is indistinct. The lung bases are partially obscured by
 extensive costochondral calcification.  The costophrenic sulci are blunted. 
 Bronchovascular markings are mildly increased, as before.  The heart and
 mediastinal structures are unchanged as well.  A double-lumen right internal
 jugular catheter has been inserted and terminates in the region of the lower
 superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small pleural
 effusions.  There is a suggestion of increased density in the retrocardiac
 area.  This region could be better assessed by a lateral view if clinically
 indicated. A double-lumen right internal jugular catheter is in central
 position.
