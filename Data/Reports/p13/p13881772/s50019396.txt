                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CHF with chest pain,
 evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. 
 In comparison to the prior study, there is interval obscuration of the right
 heart border and the medial right hemidiaphragm. Correlation with the lateral
 view suggests that this is likely due to interval development of small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying consolidation is not excluded. No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable. 
 
 Of note, an air fluid level in a tubular structure posterior to the trachea on
 the lateral view is consistent with a dilated fluid-filled esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying
 consolidation not excluded. 
 
 2.  Dilated fluid-filled esophagus.
