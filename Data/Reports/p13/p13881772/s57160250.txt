                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  This radiograph was obtained for purposes of assessing a Dobbhoff
 tube placement.  The tube is identified to the level of the distal stomach,
 but the radiograph does not include the lower abdomen, and the tip cannot be
 visualized for this reason.  Additional abdominal radiograph may be helpful
 for this purpose if warranted clinically.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for
 moderate partially layering pleural effusions bilaterally, with adjacent lower
 lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation.
