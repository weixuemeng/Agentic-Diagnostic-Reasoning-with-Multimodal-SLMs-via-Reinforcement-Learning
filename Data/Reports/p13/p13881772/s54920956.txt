                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new asymmetric perihilar opacification of the right mid lung.  This
 is superimposed on moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to increased
 on the right and perhaps somewhat decreased on the left. Increased
 opacification at the right lung base may also reflect increasing atelectasis
 associated with a pleural effusion, although an area of infection is not
 excluded. Pulmonary vessels show upper zone redistribution and Kerley lines
 are present suggesting coinciding mild congestive heart failure but generally
 similar in extent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large area of focal right perihilar opacification, superimposed on pleural
 effusions as well as findings associated with mild pulmonary edema.  The
 asymmetry suggests superimposed pneumonia as the etiology, or perhaps
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting; alternatively asymmetric
 pulmonary edema could be considered.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be
 helpful to reassess.
