                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic prostate cancer, now with cough, nausea,
 vomiting, and abdominal distention, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip and side port terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the
 stomach.  Radiopaque densities projecting over the right upper quadrant are
 compatible with gallstones.  Renally excreted contrast is partially imaged
 within the abdomen.
 
 Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are noted with underlying
 atelectasis or consolidation.  The lung apices are not well evaluated on this
 lordotic view.  Within this limitation, no significant pneumothorax is
 detected.  The interstitial lung markings are slightly increased, but the
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely
 evaluated due to bilateral pleural effusions.  The mediastinal contours are
 prominent on the right, corresponding to a known mediastinal mass.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  NG tube in place.
 2.  Bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis
 or consolidation.
 3.  Mediastinal widening corresponding to known mediastinal mass.
 4.  Cholelithiasis.
