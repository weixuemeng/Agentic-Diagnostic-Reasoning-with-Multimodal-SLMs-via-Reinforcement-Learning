                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD___ s/p VATS LUL wedge resection  // Evaluate
 for interval change      .  Review of prior imaging study yields a history of
 pancreatic cancer status post Whipple.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The apical pleural drain remains in place, slightly different in
 configuration.  A very tiny left apical pneumothorax is likely present.  No
 gross left-sided effusion.  Minimal subcutaneous emphysema and 2 surgical
 clips again noted along the lower left chest.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly lower, with atelectasis now seen at
 right-greater-than-left bases.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is probably unchanged.  No CHF.  No focal consolidation or gross
 effusion.
 
 Again seen is the left subclavian indwelling catheter , with tip at distal
 most SVC.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Slight change in configuration of the
 left apical pleural drain noted.
 
 Inspiratory volumes slightly lower, with new subsegmental atelectasis the
 right-greater-than-left bases.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
