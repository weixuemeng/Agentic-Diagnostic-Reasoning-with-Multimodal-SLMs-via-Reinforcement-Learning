                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with chest wall pain, here to evaluate for
 sternal fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier during the same admission on
 ___ at 21:20.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the lateral view of the chest, there is a triangular-shaped
 artifact along the anterior chest wall, which is likely projectional and
 related to patient positioning, but it is difficult to exclude a sternal
 fracture in this region.  No other osseous abnormality is detected.  The lungs
 are clear without airspace opacification, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 trachea is midline.  The visualized upper abdomen shows no free air beneath
 the right hemidiaphragm on this upright view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible artifact projecting over the sternum seen only on the
 lateral view. A repeat lateral radiograph or CT could be considered for
 further evaluation if there is high clinical concern for sternal fracture.
