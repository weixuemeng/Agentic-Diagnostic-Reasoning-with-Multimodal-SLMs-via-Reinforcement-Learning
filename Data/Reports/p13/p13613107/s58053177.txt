                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dyspnea on exertion for one year, assessment.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 Heart and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Lungs assessment
 demonstrates decreased volume as compared to the prior study with questionable
 minimal interstitial opacities most likely representing minimal atelectasis
 with suboptimal inspiration, but given patient's history, assessment with
 chest CT to exclude the possibility of interstitial lung disease is
 recommended.
 
 Trachea is even more displaced to the left as compared to the prior study most
 likely due to enlarged thyroid.
