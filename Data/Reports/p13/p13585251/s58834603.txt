 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:00 PM
  Large left pleural effusion, increased compared to 1 day prior.  Underlying
  consolidation most likely represents atelectasis but other consolidative
  process such as infection cannot be excluded.  Discussed with ___ by
  phone at 19:58 on ___ at time of initial review of the study. 
  Interval placement of lumbar hardware, incompletely evaluated on this study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post lumbar fusion with fevers.  Evaluate for underlying
 infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right internal jugular catheter and a
 right upper extremity PICC terminate in the mid to lower SVC.  Thoracolumbar
 fusion rods and pedicle screws have been placed since the prior chest
 radiograph.  The remaining hardware is unchanged.  
 
 There is collapse of the left lower lobe with associated volume loss of the
 left lung.  While this could reflect atelectasis, an infectious process cannot
 be excluded.  A moderate left pleural effusion is new and layers posteriorly.
 Peripheral lung opacities are likely atelectasis and/or pleural fluid and
 attention on follow up is recommended.  The appearance of the mediastinum is
 unchanged.
 
 Discussed with ___ by phone at 19:58 on ___ at time of
 initial review of the study by Dr. ___.
