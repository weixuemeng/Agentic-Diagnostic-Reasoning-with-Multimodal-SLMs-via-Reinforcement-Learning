                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for pneumothorax after surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed.  No definite pneumothorax.  Opacification at the left base is again
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural
 effusion.  The right lung is essentially clear.  Monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  
 
 Subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall extending into the neck
 has substantially decreased.
