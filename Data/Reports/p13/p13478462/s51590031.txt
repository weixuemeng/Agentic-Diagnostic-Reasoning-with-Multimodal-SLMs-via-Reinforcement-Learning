  ETT terminates 1.8 cm above carina. Right IJ catheter terminates in right
  atrium.  Multiple chest/mediastinal drains noted.  Low lung volumes and
  bibasilar atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Mediastinal width is
  difficult ot evaluate due to rotation of patient. Cardiac contours not well
  delineated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post CABG with bleeding, evaluate widened
 mediastinum.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier.
 
 Widened mediastinum is unchanged.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has
 worsened.  NG tube tip is 1.8 cm above the carina.  Right IJ catheter tip is
 in the right atrium, can be withdrawal a couple of centimeters for more
 standard position.  There are low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectases are
 larger on the left side.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions are larger on the left side.  NG tube tip is high, is in the
 mid esophagus, should be advanced for more standard position.  Mediastinal and
 chest tubes are in place.
 
 In the followup study, NG tube has been repositioned.
