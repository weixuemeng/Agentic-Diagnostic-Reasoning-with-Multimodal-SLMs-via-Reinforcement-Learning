                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG, assess effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Pulmonary edema has resolved.  Bibasilar opacities are a combination of
 small-to-moderate effusions and atelectasis.  These are grossly unchanged from
 prior allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  There is a small
 right pneumothorax.
