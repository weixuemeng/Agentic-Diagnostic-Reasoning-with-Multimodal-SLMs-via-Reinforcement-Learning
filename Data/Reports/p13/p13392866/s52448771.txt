                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Right rib pain s/p assault  // assess for chest
 traumaq
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced rib fractures are visualized.  Surgical clips are
 seen overlying the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the radiographic demonstration of trauma to the chest
 wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings 
 should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or
 Chest CT scanning.
