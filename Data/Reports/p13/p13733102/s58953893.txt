                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The pleural effusions are unchanged in
 extent.  However, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have slightly
 increased.  However, no new parenchymal opacities are seen that could reflect
 pneumonia.  
 
 Two healed left rib fractures are constant in appearance.
