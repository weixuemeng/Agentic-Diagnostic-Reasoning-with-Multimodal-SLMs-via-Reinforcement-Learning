 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Study was

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in the interval with likely small
 effusions remaining, particularly on the right.  Possible fluid tracking in
 the minor fissure.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Evidence of old left-sided rib fractures is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions, with likely
 small pleural effusions remaining, particularly on the right, with overlying
 atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved.  Persistent
 cardiomegaly.
