 HISTORY:  
 
 Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are relatively stable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with bibasilar
 airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with mild emphysematous changes again
 demonstrated.  Old left-sided rib fractures are again noted.  There are mild
 degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions with
 bibasilar atelectasis.
