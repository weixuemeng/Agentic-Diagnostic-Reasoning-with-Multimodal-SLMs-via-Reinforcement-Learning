                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, status post MVP and pneumonia with worsening
 respiratory function.  Prior x-ray concerning for hemorrhage.  Clinical
 concern more for pulmonary edema.  Assess for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, with the latest on ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The extensive bilateral parenchymal
 opacities have mildly improved, most noticeably in the left lower lung.  The
 retrocardiac opacity is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is noted.  A 1.2 cm
 discrete nodular opacity is again noted in the right upper lung, better
 assessed in the prior CT chest.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural
 effusion.
 
 A left-sided Port-A-Cath is noted with the tip terminating in the cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall improvement in multifocal opacities, which may reflect multifocal
 pneumonia, possibly coexisting with pulmonary edema.
 2.  A 1.2 cm discrete nodular right upper lobe opacity, better seen in the
 prior CT chest and concerning for neoplastic process.  Recommend short-term
 follow-up imaging to re-assess.
