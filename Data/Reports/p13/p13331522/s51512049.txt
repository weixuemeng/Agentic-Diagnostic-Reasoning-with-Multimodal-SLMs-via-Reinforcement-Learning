  Worsening multifocal infiltrates, predominantly in the right upper and right
  lower lung zones.  Given the asymmetry, this is most concerning for developing
  multifocal pneumonia. Asymmetric edema is a possibility given the history of
  mitral prolapse, which can produce an asymmetric, right greater than left,
  edema.  Small right pleural effusion, probable small left pleural effusion.. 
  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged subclavian central venous catheter in the mid SVC.
  No cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications, more prominent on the right.  This could reflect
 some asymmetry in flash pulmonary edema or be a manifestation of multifocal
 consolidation.  There is probably some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 Central catheter remains in good position.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions with atelectatic changes at the bases.
