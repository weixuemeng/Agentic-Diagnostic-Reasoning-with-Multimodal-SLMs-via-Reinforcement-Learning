                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema and pneumonia, assess for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are well
 expanded with marked interstitial abnormality bilaterally with more focal
 coalescent opacities in the right upper lung in retrocardiac positions which
 could reflect pneumonia.  Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions
 may have increased slightly. These findings are unchanged to slightly worsened
 from the previous examination.  Left subclavian central venous catheter is in
 unchanged position within the mid-to-lower SVC.  The heart remains mildly
 enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema with coalescent right upper
 lung and left retrocardiac opacities which could reflect multifocal pneumonia
 and accompanying perhaps slightly increased bilateral pleural effusions,
 greater on the right.
