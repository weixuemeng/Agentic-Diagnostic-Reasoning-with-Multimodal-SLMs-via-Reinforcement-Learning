                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable.  Again seen
 are widespread parenchymal opacities, now worsened compared to the most recent
 prior study.  Additionally, there is a new retrocardiac opacity, indicating
 partial left lower lobe collapse with an expanded upper lobe.  There is a new
 small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Again seen is a left
 chest port with tip in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New partial left lower lobe collapse with worsening bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, consistent with re-aspiration. Hemorrhage is possible,
 and pulmonary edema is least favored as an etiology.
