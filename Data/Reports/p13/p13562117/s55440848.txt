                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever
 
 COMPARISON: ___
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  A moderate
 right-sided effusion is grossly similar to ___.  A tiny left
 effusion has resolved.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis,
 unchanged.  The remainder of the lungs are stable with no new consolidations. 
 The heart and mediastinal contours are normal. No pneumothorax or pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate right pleural effusion and resolution of
 previously noted left pleural effusion. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded.
