 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity in the right lower lobe persists but is slightly less conspicuous

 clear without edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not widened.  No
 acute osseous abnormality.

 1.  Persistent low lung volumes with slight interval decrease in the left
 lower lobe opacity that is most likely atelectasis.
 
 2.  No evidence of fracture but this exam is not dedicated for imaging of the

 obtained.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated rib radiographs corresponding to focal exam
 findings if clinical concern for fracture.
