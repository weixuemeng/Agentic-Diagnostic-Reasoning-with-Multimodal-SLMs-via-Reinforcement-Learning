                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  5 mm nodular density
 projecting over the left lung base remains unchanged, and no focal
 consolidation is demonstrated.  Streaky atelectasis is seen in the left lung
 base. Lungs are hyperinflated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. The bones are diffusely demineralized. Surgical clip is noted in
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left basilar atelectasis. Unchanged 5 mm nodular opacity projecting
 over the left lung base. Again this could be projectional artifact or reflect
 a small nodule. Consider CT for further assessment if there is high clinical
 concern.
