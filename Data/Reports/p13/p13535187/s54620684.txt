                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known mets in chest from cholangial
 carcinoma - ? progression.  Question metastasis from cholangiocarcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lungs are remarkable for
 a new nodular opacity in the right mid lung measuring 9 mm in diameter
 overlying the fourth anterior rib level and probably in the anterior segment
 of the right upper lobe on the lateral view.  Additional subcentimeter nodular
 opacity is seen in the left upper lobe at the level of the fourth posterior
 rib.  Recent CT of ___ demonstrated multiple small pulmonary
 nodules, several of which are likely below the resolution of conventional
 chest radiographs, and others of which are faintly visible radiographically. 
 Right hemidiaphragm has elevated since the prior radiograph and is associated
 with adjacent linear atelectasis at the right base.  No definite pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparently new or growing small pulmonary nodules compared to prior chest
 radiograph of ___ in this patient with known history of multiple
 pulmonary nodules on interval CT of ___.  Given the small size of
 the nodules, dedicated chest CT would be more accurate for determining
 interval change in size and number of pulmonary nodules.
