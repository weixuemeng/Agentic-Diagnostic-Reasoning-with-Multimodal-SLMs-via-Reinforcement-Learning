                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILMS, ___ AT 20:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hepatic adenocarcinoma with worsening
 intermittent fevers and chills, question infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 20:36.
 
 PA and lateral views of ___ at 20:12 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Relatively lower lung volumes.  There is a suggestion of some blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle which could reflect a small effusion, although
 this is not definitively confirmed on the lateral projection.  No airspace
 consolidation is appreciated.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with the heart being mildly
 enlarged.  Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  If the patient's
 symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
