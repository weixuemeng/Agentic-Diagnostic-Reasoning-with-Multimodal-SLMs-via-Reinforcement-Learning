  1. Possible 0.8 cm left apical pulmonary nodule. Recommend lordotic view
  radiograph to assess whether true pulmonary nodule versus sclerotic osseous
  focus.
  
  2.  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
  radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
  cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
  either bone detail views or CT scanning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC with left clavicular chest wall pain. Assess for
 obvious traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates moderately well expanded
 lungs. A 0.8 x  0.4 cm left apical opacity projecting over anterior portion of
 left first rib is worrisome for a pulmonary nodule. Right lung is clear. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits. No displaced
 rib or clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Possible 0.8 cm left apical pulmonary nodule. Recommend lordotic view
 radiograph to assess whether true pulmonary nodule versus sclerotic osseous
 focus in rib.
 
 2.  Although no fracture or other bone abnormality is seen, conventional chest
 radiographs are not appropriate for detection or characterization of chest
 cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with
 either bone detail views or CT scanning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with ___ QA
 nurses via email on ___ at 9:11 AM.
