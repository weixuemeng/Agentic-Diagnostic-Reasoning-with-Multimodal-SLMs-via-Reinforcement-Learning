                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  There is a retrocardiac opacity
 adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm, better seen on lateral view.  This could
 represent an early developing pneumonia.  No appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm, better seen on
 lateral view.  This could represent an early developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
