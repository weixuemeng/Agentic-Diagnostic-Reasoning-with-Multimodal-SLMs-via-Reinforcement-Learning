                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cirrhosis and elevated creatinine.  Is there
 an infection or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Diffuse, granular interstitial pulmonary abnormality is new.  This does not
 have the expected appearance of a pulmonary edema.  it could be due to
 pneumocystis pneumonia or miliary infection such as tuberculosis.  If it is
 not infectious, consider a pulmonary drug reaction.  Heart is normal size and
 there is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Mild enlargement of the left hilus
 is the only suggestion of central adenopathy.
