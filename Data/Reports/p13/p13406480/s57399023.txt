                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and ascites, diffuse interstitial process on
 chest x-ray.
 
 CHEST, SUPINE:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Interstitial process seen on the prior chest
 x-ray is now more prominent than on the prior occasions, though it is thought
 that most of this is likely due to the supine position on the current film as
 opposed to the standard projections in upright position on the other.  No
 effusions are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial process probably unchanged, but appears more
 prominent, likely due to supine position.
