                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is right rotation of the patient on the current radiograph.  A left
 chest cardiac device is seen with associated dual leads in grossly appropriate
 location projecting over the right heart.  An ET tube is seen terminating
 approximately 1.7 cm above the carina.  Tracheal and bronchial tree
 calcifications are noted.  Allowing for a suboptimal inspiratory effort and
 low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. 
 The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Generalized bilateral interstitial
 prominence may reflect some component of underlying mild chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral mild interstitial prominence may reflect underlying mild
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  No focal lung consolidations.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 2. ET tube terminates 1.7 cm above the carina, could be retracted 2 cm for
 safe positioning in the lower trachea.
