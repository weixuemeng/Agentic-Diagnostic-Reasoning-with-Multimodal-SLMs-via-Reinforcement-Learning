                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, on chemo, and fevers.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right upper lobe radiation changes are grossly stable given
 differences in modality from the prior study.  The volume loss in the right
 upper lobe causes shifting of the mediastinum to the right.  Otherwise, the
 mediastinum as well as the cardiac size are stable. The right hilar adenopathy
 was better seen on the prior PET.  Blunting of the lateral right costophrenic
 angle is likely from pleural thickening.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe post-radiation changes without convincing
 evidence of pneumonia.
