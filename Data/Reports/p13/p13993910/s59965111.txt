                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis, intubated  // ett placement picc
 line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina.  A left-sided PICC
 terminates in the upper SVC.  The heart is within normal limits for size on
 this AP view.  The pulmonary vasculature is engorged without overt pulmonary
 edema.  There is free air under the right hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles likely reflects small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Increased bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis or infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Free air underneath the right hemidiaphragm may be related to recent abdominal
 surgery, however if there is concern for viscus perforation recommend CT.
 
 Small bilateral effusions and bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis
 however infection aspiration should be considered.
