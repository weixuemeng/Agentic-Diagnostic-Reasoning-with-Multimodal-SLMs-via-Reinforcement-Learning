 consolidation, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low with layering bilateral effusions and bibasilar
 airspace opacities which are not significantly changed and may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Left apical
 linear opacity likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable.
