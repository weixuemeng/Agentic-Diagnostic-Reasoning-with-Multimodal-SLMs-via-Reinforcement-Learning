                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:32 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with heart block.  Question edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 3:08 p.m.:
 
 Lungs are clear.  Heart size is top normal.  Allowing for differences in
 patient's positioning and radiographic technique the slight increase in
 thickness of paratracheal tissue since ___ could be due to vascular
 engorgement.  Separation of the presumed internal jugular portion of the pacer
 lead from the midline trachea which suggested either thyroid or other mass or
 hematoma has not increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  The intracardiac
 course of the lead suggests placement in the cavity of the right ventricle. 
 As before, a lateral view is recommended for three-dimensional triangulation.
