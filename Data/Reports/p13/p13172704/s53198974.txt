                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Malaise and cough, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent prior study, there is a new opacity in
 the right lung base obscuring the right heart border and the border of the
 right hemidiaphragm which also projects over the heart on the corresponding
 lateral radiograph compatible with right middle lobe pneumonia.  A small to
 moderate right pleural effusion is also noted.  The left lung demonstrates
 increased lung markings in the lung base without focal consolidation, which
 may reflect a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 engorgement of the pulmonary vessels, which is unchanged.  A small left
 pleural effusion is suggested on the lateral view.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and unchanged.  Minimal calcification of the
 aortic knob is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Focal opacity of the right lung base with small bilateral pleural
 effusions may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, new from ___.
 2.  Unchanged mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
