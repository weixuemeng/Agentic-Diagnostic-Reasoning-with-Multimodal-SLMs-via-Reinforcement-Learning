                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess change in pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there appears to be some small
 decrease in the right pleural effusion, though some of this may merely reflect
 the position of the patient.  However, there has been an increase in pleural
 effusion on the left.  Otherwise, little change.
