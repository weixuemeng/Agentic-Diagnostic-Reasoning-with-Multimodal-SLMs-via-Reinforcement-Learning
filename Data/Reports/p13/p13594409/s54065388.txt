                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F hx of PEs, peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p multiple abdominal
 explorations c/b leak and now with intra-abdominal bleeding presents in septic
 and hemorrhagic shock s/p massive transfusion and now s/p IR.  // ?
 mediastinal bleeding / fluid? Perform upright cxr    ? mediastinal bleeding /
 fluid? Perform upright cxr
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are lower lung
 volumes.  The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  The
 nasogastric tube extends to the upper to mid stomach.  The area of the
 previous loop proximally is not included in this study.
 There is increased opacification at the left base with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe
 with pleural effusion.
 The mediastinal silhouette is more sharply seen and less prominent than on the
 previous examination.  If there is any ease a serious clinical concern for
 mediastinal bleeding, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
