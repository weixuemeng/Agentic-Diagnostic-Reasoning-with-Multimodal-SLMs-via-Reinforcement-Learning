 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:30 PM
  An endotracheal tube is identified not significantly changed in position.  A
  right internal jugular catheter appears to terminate at or just above the
  cavoatrial junction.  An enteric tube descends a thorax, its distal and below
  level of the hemidiaphragm out of the field of view.  Diffuse bilateral
  pulmonary consolidations appear minimally progressed relative to prior
  examination particularly within the right hemithorax.  Obscuration of the left
  hemidiaphragm is suggestive of pleural effusion.
