                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the proximal right
 atrium, unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low.  Asymmetric appearance of the
 lungs has resolved, likely reflecting rotation on the prior exam and
 asymmetric edema.  However, mild left lower lobe opacity persists, suggesting
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
