 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:13 PM
  An endotracheal tube is identified low within the trachea approximately 2.7 cm
  from the level of the carina.  A right internal jugular venous catheter
  terminates within the right atrium.  A left PICC projects over the anticipated
  location of the mid superior vena cava.  There is near complete opacification
  of the left hemi thorax progressed relative to prior study.  Degree of
  mediastinal shift is difficult to ascertain given patient rotation.  Findings
  likely reflect pleural effusion.  Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may
  reflect partial collapse of the left lower lobe, unchanged.

 COMPARISON TO ___.  The endotracheal tube projects 2.6 cm above the
 carina.  The right internal jugular vein catheter tip projects over the right
 atrium and should be pulled back by approximately 6 cm.  The left PICC line
 projects over the cavoatrial junction.  Subtotal opacification of the left
 hemi thorax.  The opacities on the right, likely caused in part by a right
 pleural effusion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema is constant.
