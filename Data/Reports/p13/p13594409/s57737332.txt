                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left arm approach PICC line terminates at the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  The study is suboptimal secondary to patient rotation. 
 Opacification of the left lower lobe is likely a combination of effusion and
 atelectasis, as seen on a recent CT from ___.
 Increased density of the right lower lung is likely a function of the
 overlying breast implant.  The right lung is otherwise clear and there is no
 right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification of the left lower lobe, likely a function of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis as seen on prior CT, however underlying pneumonia is not excluded.
