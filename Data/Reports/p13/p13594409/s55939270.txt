                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F hx of PEs, peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p multiple abdominal
 explorations c/b leak and now with intra-abdominal bleeding presents in septic
 and hemorrhagic shock s/p massive transfusion and now s/p IR.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at
 05:51.
 CTA from ___ at 09:40.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Apparent widening of the mediastinum is continuous with thickened left apical
 pleural margin, obscuring the aortic knob.  This may represent either widened
 mediastinum due to bleeding or extravasation or pleural fluid tracking
 superiorly in the supine patient.  Of note a large vascular introducer has
 been removed from the left neck and upper mediastinum since ___:00 and could be
 a source of bleeding.  .
 
 There is increased interstitial opacities and fullness of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  New right ground-glass perihilar opacity could be edema or
 aspiration.  There is left lower lobe collapse with leftward mediastinal shift
 and large left pleural effusion.  Small pleural effusion on the right is also
 likely.
 The nasogastric tube is coiled in the hypopharynx and terminates in the upper
 stomach.  Right-sided introducer, ETT and left-sided PICC appear unchanged in
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Widened mediastinum which may represent vascular dissection or layering
 pleural fluid given supine film.  Repeat exam with upright film which is read
 concurrently with a radiology resident is recommended.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse with large pleural effusion.
 3.  Coiled nasogastric tube in the hypopharynx, terminating in upper stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat exam with upright film which is read concurrently
 with a radiology resident is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings regarding the mediastinum with instructions for
 repeat exam and coiled nasogastric tube were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 4:55 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
