                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with  w/ carcinomatosis s/p ex-lap, debulking
 c/b colonic leak s/p ___'s s/p ex-lap, washout, hematoma evacuation x2,
 ex-lap washout SBR, washout   partial fascial closure  // please evaluate for
 pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  CT
 torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased leftward rotation of the patient limits the evaluation.  Left PICC
 line is likely in stable position in the upper SVC.  Moderate to large left
 pleural effusion persists.  Worsening opacification projecting over the right
 lower lung is difficult to completely account for by patient's right breast
 prosthesis and could reflect combination of right lower lobe atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Pulmonary edema is
 minimal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left rotation of the patient severely limits the evaluation.
 2. Unchanged moderate to large left pleural effusion.
 3. Worsening opacification over the right lower lung is incompletely accounted
 for by patient's right breast prosthesis and could reflect some combination of
 right lower lobe atelectasis and at least small pleural effusion.  If further
 evaluation is desired well-positioned frontal and lateral radiographs could be
 obtained.  Additionally, the images should be reviewed by the radiologist to
 determine whether additional lateral decubitus views would be helpful. 
 Alternatively, a CT of the chest could be obtained.
