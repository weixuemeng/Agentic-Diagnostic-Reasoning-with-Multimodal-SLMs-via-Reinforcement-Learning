  Endotracheal tube slightly low lying ending approximately 2.1 cm above the
  carina.  This can be retracted approximately 2.0 cm for more optimal
  positioning.  Right IJ central venous catheter ends at the cavoatrial
  junction.  Nasoenteric tube enters the stomach.  Lung volumes are low with a
  dense left basilar which may represent a combination of atelectasis and
  pleural fluid although infection is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock s/p GI anastomotic leak  //
 appropriate positioning of T/L/D? aspiration PNA?      appropriate positioning
 of T/L/D? aspiration PNA?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina.  It could
 be pulled back about 2 cm for more optimal position.  Right IJ catheter
 extends to the cavoatrial junction and the nasogastric tube extends well into
 the stomach.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent with layering
 effusions with volume loss most prominently involving the left lower lobe in
 the retrocardiac region.
