                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration pneumonia, s/p extubation  //
 Evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  The
 right IJ central line remains present, similar in position.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are improved and the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 significantly smaller.
 
 Elevated left hemidiaphragm remains present.  Previously seen dense
 retrocardiac opacity has improved, with residual patchy opacity still present.
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is new question
 atelectasis, but attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No
 gross effusion.  The extreme inferior right costophrenic angle is excluded
 from the film.  Mild vascular plethora could be accounted for low inspiratory
 volumes.
 
 Old healed fractures of the left fifth ,sixth and seventh ribs again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of ET tube and NG tube.
 
 Considerable interval improvement in previously seen retrocardiac opacity,
 though residual patchy opacity remains present.
 
 New small right cardiomediastinal patchy opacity -?  Atelectasis, although
 attention to this area on followup films is requested to exclude a focus of
 aspiration pneumonitis or an infectious pneumonic infiltrate.
