                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is bibasilar
 opacification corresponding to opacity over the spine on the lateral view,
 which could represent infection.  There are diffusely increased interstitial
 lung markings compatible with mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  A small left
 pleural effusion is possible.  No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema and possible small left pleural
 effusion.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities could reflect underlying infection.  Consider repeat
 chest radiographs following diuresis.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
