                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status, slurred speech and
 dysmetria
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal contours
 otherwise are unremarkable. The hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There are streaky bibasilar airspace opacities.  Mild
 lateral pleural thickening is noted at the bases bilaterally. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified otherwise.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
 Infection is not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Consider
 repeat PA and lateral views when the patient is able to take a deeper
 inspiration.
