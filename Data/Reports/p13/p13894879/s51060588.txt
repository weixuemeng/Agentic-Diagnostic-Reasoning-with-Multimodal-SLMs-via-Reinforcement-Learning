                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TVR/PPM  // eval for pneumo s/o CT removal 
 eval for pneumo s/o CT removal
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ 11:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 14:18 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the left chest tube with no pneumothorax appreciated;
 however, the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine
 technique.  If this remains of clinical concern, followup imaging in the
 upright or decubitus position would be advised.  Endotracheal tube, right
 internal jugular introducer, and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are
 unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable
 status post median sternotomy with valve replacement.  Lungs appear grossly
 clear.  No overt pulmonary edema.
