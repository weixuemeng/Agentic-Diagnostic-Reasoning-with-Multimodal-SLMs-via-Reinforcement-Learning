                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p redo sternotomy TVR and PPM epicardial
 leads  // eval for effusion or infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 07:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, a small right effusion is now larger, likely with
 an element of underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the right base.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is background COPD
 and chronic cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires.  One pacemaker device
 overlies the right chest, with apparent abandoned lead and additional lead
 overlying the right heart.  Another pacemaker overlies the right upper abdomen
 and is associated with epicardial leads, which are similar in configuration. 
 Mild vascular plethora, though doubt overt CHF.  No left-sided effusion. 
 Probable slight interval improvement in atelectasis at the left base.  Subtle
 parenchymal abnormalities might not be apparent radiographically.
 
 Left IJ central line tip overlies the lower SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion as increased compared with ___, with
 probable underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Otherwise, doubt
 significant interval change.
