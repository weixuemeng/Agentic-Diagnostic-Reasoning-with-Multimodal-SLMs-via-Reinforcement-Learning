 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation has redistributed in the right lung and
 improved slightly on the left.  This variability is more characteristic of
 pulmonary edema than multifocal pneumonia, although concurrent pneumonia is
 certainly a possibility, particularly in the right upper lobe.
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.  Mediastinal
 vasculature is engorged.
