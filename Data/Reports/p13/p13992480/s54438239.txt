                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CP and SOB  // concern for worsening
 pulmonary edema, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient positioning is somewhat suboptimal, this limits assessment of the
 cardiomediastinal contour.  In particular, the position of the tip of the
 right-sided PICC cannot be definitively assessed but appears to be in the
 right atrium.  Similar in appearance when compared to the prior study.  There
 is increased prominence of the bilateral hila with perihilar airspace opacity
 consistent with pulmonary edema, this has increased slightly when compared to
 the prior study.  Presumed small left pleural effusion.  No right-sided
 pleural effusion seen.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal patient positioning limits assessment however there appears to be
 an increase in the degree of pulmonary edema when compared to the prior study.
 The tip of the right-sided PICC cannot be evaluated but is likely in the right
 atrium.
