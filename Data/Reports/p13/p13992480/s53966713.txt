                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and sputum production, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema.  Streaky
 linear opacities at left base likely reflect scarring when correlated with a
 CT study dated ___.  A few more focal patchy nodular areas at the left
 apex are unchanged dating back to ___.  No focal airspace consolidation is
 seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  There is marked kyphosis of the thoracic spine with mild
 degenerative changes and no obvious vertebral compression fracture.  Prominent
 soft tissues in the superior mediastinum with slight deviation of the trachea
 towards the right, likely reflects the presence of known thyroid goiter.
