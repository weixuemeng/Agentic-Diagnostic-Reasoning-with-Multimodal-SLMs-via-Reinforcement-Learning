                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right back pain, history of recent pneumonia, evidence of right
 lower lung opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, opacity at the right lung
 base has minimally decreased in extent.  The lateral radiograph shows that the
 opacity is dominant in the anterior lung regions.  However, the radiograph
 also shows a new parenchymal consolidation in the posterior parts of the right
 lung, not evident on the previous image.  This opacity is likely to represent
 a new focus of pneumonia.
 
 Unchanged scarring and postoperative changes at the right apex and the level
 of the left hilus.  No pleural effusions.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.
