                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph, ___ chest CT and older
 chest radiographs and chest CTs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous right upper lobe resection with
 a post-operative volume loss and pleural thickening as well as peripheral
 parenchymal scarring in the lower right hemithorax.  Heterogeneous opacities
 in the right lower lung have worsened compared to the ___ chest
 radiograph and are concerning for pneumonia with associated mucous plugging of
 bronchiectatic airways.  Left lung demonstrates apical scarring at a previous
 wedge resection site and nonspecific lingular scarring, but no focal areas of
 consolidation.  There are no pleural effusions.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Heterogeneous opacities in right lower lung, likely corresponding to pneumonia
 complicating pre-existing bronchiectasis, with associated mucus plugging.  
 
 Consider a 4 week followup chest x-ray to confirm resolution following
 appropriate therapy.  If this fails to improve at followup chest x-ray, or if
 symptoms progress despite treatment, consider a chest CT with contrast to
 exclude an obstructing juxtahilar mass.  Findings entered into radiology
 communications dashboard on the date of the study.
