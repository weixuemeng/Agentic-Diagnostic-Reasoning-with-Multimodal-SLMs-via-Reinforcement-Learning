                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post cystoscopy and stent
 placement with aspiration on extubation.  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Previously described findings status post
 right lower lobe pneumonia appears unchanged.  As there is no appreciable
 change in these residuals, they most likely represent scar formations.  There
 is no evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates to confirm the clinical
 suspicion of acute aspiration pneumonia.
