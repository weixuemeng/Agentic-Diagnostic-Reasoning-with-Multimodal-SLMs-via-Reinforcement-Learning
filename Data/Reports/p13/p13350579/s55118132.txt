 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, bronchomalacia, status post right main stem bronchus stent.
 Evaluation for resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 lower lobe pneumonia has almost completely resolved.  Resolution is more
 impressive on the lateral than on the frontal radiograph.  However, at the
 right anterior lung bases, areas of scarring and pleural thickening persist. 
 The left lung is better inflated than on the previous examination.  The right
 PICC line has been removed.  Status after right adenocarcinoma and subsequent
 surgery.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
