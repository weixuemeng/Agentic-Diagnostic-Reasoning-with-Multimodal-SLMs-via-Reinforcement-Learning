                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Persistent right basilar opacification primarily seen anteriorly,
 though there is also parenchymal opacification seen in the posterior portion
 on the lateral view.  The findings are most consistent with pneumonia and
 pleural fluid.  Postoperative changes are again seen in the right apex and in
 the region of the left hilus.
 
 There could be a somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification in the
 left mid-to-lower zone that could also be a focus of consolidation.
