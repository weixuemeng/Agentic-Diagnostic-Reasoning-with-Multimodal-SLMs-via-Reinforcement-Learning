                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD and bilateral
 upper lobectomy with right middle lobe resection due to bronchiectasis,
 currently with increased cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since prior examination, the position of the mediastinum with slight right
 mediastinal shift is unchanged.  Lungs are essentially clear except for
 unchanged post-surgical areas of scarring.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion.  There are no new consolidations that might suggest interval
 development of acute process.
