                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.  CT abdomen pelvis
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Upper lung lucency is consistent
 with emphysema.  Lungs remain hyperinflated.  There is persistent opacity at
 the right medial lung base which is most consistent with chronic atelectasis
 given findings on prior CT abdomen pelvis.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contour is normal.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema, mild cardiomegaly.  Opacity at the right medial lung base is most
 compatible with chronic atelectasis.
