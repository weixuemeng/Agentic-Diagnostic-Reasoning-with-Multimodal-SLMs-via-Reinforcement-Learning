                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve repair.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again noted
 which obscure assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma. Hazy opacities within
 the lung bases with increased interstitial markings appear similar compared to
 the previous CT and chest radiograph.  Chain sutures are seen within the right
 lower lobe.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively unchanged appearance of the chest with bilateral calcified pleural
 plaques and slightly hazy opacities with increased interstitial markings at
 the lung bases suggestive of chronic interstitial lung disease, better
 characterized on the previous CT exam.  No new focal consolidation.
