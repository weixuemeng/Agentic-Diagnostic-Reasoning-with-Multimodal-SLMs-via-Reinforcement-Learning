                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY: Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bilaterally, calcified pleural plaques are unchanged.  A
 wedge resection site is noted in the right mid lung with a staple line.  Mild
 peripheral reticulation at the lung bases is probably unchanged allowing for
 differences in technique.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
