  lung volumes or early pneumonia.
  2. Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain and palpitations, evaluate for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___ and chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are similar to prior studies and
 consistent with prior asbestos exposure.  Low lung volumes cause
 bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.  Surgical chain sutures
 project over the right middle lung.  Airspace opacities overlying the right
 lower lung is new, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.  Chronic
 basilar interstitial lung abnormality is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe airspace opacities may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting
 2. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest x-ray in ___ weeks after completion of
 antibiotic therapy to ensure resolution.
