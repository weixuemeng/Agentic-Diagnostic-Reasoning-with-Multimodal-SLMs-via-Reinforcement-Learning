                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF who presents for evaluation of chest pressure. 
 Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve
 replacement.  The heart size is normal.  Dense coronary calcifications are
 again seen.  Chain sutures within the mid right lung field are overall
 unchanged; however, there appears to be subtle increase in hazy opacification
 overlying the right lower lung. There is also evidence of interstital
 thickening, secondary to interstitial edema.  Calcified pleural plaques are
 again redemonstrated.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increase in opacity over the right lower lung field and
 interstitial thickening may be secondary to pulmonary edema.
