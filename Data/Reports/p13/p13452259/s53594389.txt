                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with past medical history of
 pericarditis and left pleural effusion as of chest examinations in ___. 
 Now recent weight loss, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a portable chest
 examination ___ ___ and a PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The previously diagnosed enlargement of the heart silhouette has
 normalized completely and the heart size and configuration is now within
 normal limits.  The thoracic aorta is mildly widened but does not show any
 local contour abnormalities or advanced walled calcifications.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax
 grossly within normal limits.  In comparison with the previous examination the
 earlier identified cardiac enlargement and presence of bilateral pleural
 effusions mostly on the left side have cleared up completely.  Also at the
 examination of ___ identified pulmonary vascular upper zone
 re-distribution pattern has normalized.  The chest examination does not
 demonstrate any new acute abnormality or any suspicious lesion that might be
 the cause of the patient's weight loss.  As identified on previous examination
 there is evidence of previous abdominal surgery with multiple surgical
 metallic clips in the right upper quadrant, probably gallbladder surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normalization of previously identified enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette related to pericardial effusion.  No pulmonary congestion.  No
 evidence of manifest or suspicious new pulmonary abnormalities.
