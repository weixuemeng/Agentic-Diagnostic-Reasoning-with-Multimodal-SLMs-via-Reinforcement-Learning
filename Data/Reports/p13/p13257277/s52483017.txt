                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, cough, new oxygen requirement.  //
 Evidence of pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiac silhouette has slightly
 increased in size and is now mildly enlarged. Upper zone vascular
 redistribution is present without overt edema. New focal consolidation is
 present within the right middle lobe and adjacent right lower lobe partially
 obscuring the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm contours.
 Additionally, there are subtle peribronchiolar opacities in the right upper
 lobe.  Linear bibasilar scarring is unchanged, and there are no pleural
 effusions. Surgical clips in the cervical region are suggestive of prior
 thyroid surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New multifocal opacities in the right lung, concerning for developing
 bronchopneumonia. Recommend followup radiographs in 4 weeks after antibiotic
 therapy to ensure resolution.
