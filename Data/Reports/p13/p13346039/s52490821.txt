                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:07 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with small cell lung carcinoma and pleural
 effusions.  Evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema in the right lung is worsened.  Increasing opacification
 in the left hemithorax could be due to the enlarging moderate left pleural
 effusion alone, in the setting of the large longstanding left hilar and
 mediastinal mass.  Pneumonia is not excluded but does not need to be invoked
 to explain radiographic changes.  No pneumothorax.
