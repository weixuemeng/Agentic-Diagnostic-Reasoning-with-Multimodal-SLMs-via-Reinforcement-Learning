                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough for one to two months, decreased
 oxygen saturation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT and ___ chest radiograph.
 
 Lung volumes are low, unchanged since the prior study.  In addition to
 widespread interstitial opacities on the prior study, there is new left upper
 lung opacity, seen on both PA and lateral views.  Differential diagnosis would
 include infectious process versus neoplasm.  Given the presence of
 interstitial lung disease and relatively low course of complaints, assessment
 with chest CT, preferably after administration of IV contrast is recommended.
 In ase infectious process is suspected, repeated chest radiograph 4 weeeks
 after antibiotics is recommended.
