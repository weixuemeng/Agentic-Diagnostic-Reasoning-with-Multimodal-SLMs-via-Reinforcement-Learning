                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing pleural
 effusion on the left. Extensive perihilar and left upper lobe mass-like
 consolidation with the hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again seen. 
 Some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with residual
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
