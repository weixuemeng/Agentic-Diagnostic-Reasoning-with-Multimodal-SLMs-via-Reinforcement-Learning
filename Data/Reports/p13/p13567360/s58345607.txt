                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath 
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  
 
 Cardiac size is enlarged, but difficult to fully assess given rotation.  There
 is bilateral pulmonary edema.  Low lung volumes contribute to atelectasis. 
 Pneumonia is difficult to exclude given low lung volumes.  Effusions may be
 present. Overlying soft tissues also contribute to the bibasilar opacities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiac failure.  Basilar opacities may be due to overlying soft tissue and
 atelectasis although effusions or infection are also possible.
