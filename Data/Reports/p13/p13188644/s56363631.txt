                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with 15-foot fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine portable view of the chest.  Low lung volumes are
 noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Within this
 limitation and due to limitation of overlying trauma board, the lungs are
 grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits
 allowing for this limitation.  No displaced fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable supine portable plain film.
