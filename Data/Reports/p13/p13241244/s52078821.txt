                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG x6  // eval ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, multiple lines and tubes have been removed,
 including the left chest tube.  Again seen is a right-sided PICC line.  The
 tip is not well visualized, but probably overlies the mid/distal SVC.
 
 On the current examination, there is a very small left apical pneumothorax. 
 This is new compared with ___.  The possibility of a miniscule
 left apical pneumothorax on the prior film cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 right-sided pneumothorax is identified.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  Left and right
 base opacities are similar to the prior study.  Upper zone redistribution and
 mild diffuse vascular blurring is again seen, possibly slightly improved. 
 Probable small bilateral effusions, grossly similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New very small left apical pneumothorax status post removal left chest
 tube.
 2. Possible slight improvement in CHF findings.
 3. Otherwise, allowing for interval removal of multiple tube/lines, I doubt
 gross interval change.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Page sent to physician covering cardiac surgery on call, Dr
 ___ (#___), at the time of discovery at 10:09 pm on ___.
