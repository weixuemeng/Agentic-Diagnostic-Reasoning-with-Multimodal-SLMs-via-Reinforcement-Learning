                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of AML and granulocytic sarcoma, now with increasing
 shortness of breath and cough.  Evaluate for pleural effusion and/or evidence
 of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired.  As
 before, there is a large-bore tunneled right internal jugular central venous
 catheter that ends within the mid to high right atrium.  Moderate right and
 small to moderate left pleural effusions are substantially increased compared
 to the prior chest radiograph from ___.  Consolidative bibasilar
 opacities are most likely due to compressive atelectasis, although infection
 in either base is not excluded.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right and small to moderate left pleural effusions, substantially
 increased compared to prior radiographs from ___.
 
 2.  ___ consolidative opacities, likely compressive atelectasis,
 although infection in either lung base is not excluded.
