                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 which may in part be due to atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are seen with overlying atelectasis.  There is prominent indistinctness of the
 hila, which suggests a component of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 The basilar opacity, particularly on the left, may be due to combination of
 above.  However, underlying consolidation not excluded.  Low lung volumes and
 pulmonary edema.
