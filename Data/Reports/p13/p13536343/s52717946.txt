 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with worsening hypoxia, possible aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes with patchy opacity at the left base which may
 reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  However, when compared to the prior study there is no significant
 interval change.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given low lung volumes and
 differences in patient positioning between studies.  Prominent amount of gas
 within the stomach.  Left hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  No pleural
 effusions.
