  1. Moderate-severe left and small right pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and
  pulmonary edema suggestive of volume overload.
  2. The combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions obscure the left heart
  border and left hemidiaphragm, and underlying consolidation cannot be
  excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with stroke, heart failure  // pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are noted. There is a moderate-large left and small right
 pleural effusion, some increase on the prior examination. The left
 hemidiaphragm and left heart border are obscured, likely secondary to pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded. Additionally, there is bilateral hilar prominence and cephalization
 of the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is no
 pneumothorax identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially
 obscured but appears enlarged, unchanged as compared to the prior examination.
 Moderate-severe, right acromioclavicular joint degenerative changes are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate-severe left and small right pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and
 pulmonary edema suggestive of volume overload.
 2. The combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions obscure the left heart
 border and left hemidiaphragm, and underlying consolidation is likely.
