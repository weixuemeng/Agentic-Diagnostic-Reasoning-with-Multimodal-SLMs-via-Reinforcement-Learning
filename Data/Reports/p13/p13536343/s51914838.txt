                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, oxygen requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and torso CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged with left ventricular predominance.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta again noted.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta is re-
 demonstrated.  There are low lung volumes.  The pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases, including a somewhat more ovoid appearing opacity in the left
 lung base, likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints are noted.  Compression
 deformity of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged compared to the prior CT from
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large hiatal hernia with bibasilar atelectasis.
