                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph at 16:26 and CT chest at 13:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with tip
 terminating near the medial left mid lung field.  Small pneumothorax seen on
 the previous CT exam is not clearly identified on the current study.  There
 has been interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion, now appearing
 small to moderate in size.  Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left
 lateral chest wall is noted.
 
 Again demonstrated are low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are similar possible small pneumomediastinum noted to the left lateral aspect
 of the aortic knob.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect areas of
 compressive atelectasis.  Multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with slight interval decrease in
 size of the left pleural effusion, now appearing small to moderate in size. 
 Continued bibasilar atelectasis.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are re-
 demonstrated.
