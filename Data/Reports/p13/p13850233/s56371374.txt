                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ at 13:18 from outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the left base
 reflects a combination of a moderate size pleural effusion and left basilar
 atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the right lung base.  Known
 left-sided small pneumothorax is not clearly seen on the current exam. 
 Multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No definite pneumothorax seen on the current exam.
 2. Moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar opacification likely
 reflective of compressive atelectasis.
 3. Multiple left-sided rib fractures.
