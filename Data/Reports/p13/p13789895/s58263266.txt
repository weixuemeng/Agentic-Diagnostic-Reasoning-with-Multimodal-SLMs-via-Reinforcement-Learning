                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the
 development of right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the
 base.  In view of the clinical history, the possibility of pneumonia in this
 region cannot be excluded.
 
 No definite vascular congestion.
 
 Of incidental note is evidence of old fractures of the eighth and ninth
 posterior ribs on the right as well as opacification in the region of the
 coracoclavicular ligament, which may relate to previous trauma.  There is also
 an apparent old healed fracture of the left clavicle.
