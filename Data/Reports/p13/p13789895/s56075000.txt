 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with worsening cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower inspiratory effort seen

 major fissure more so than on prior.  Underlying middle and lower lobe
 atelectasis and possible consolidation is possible.  The left lung is grossly
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not significantly changed. 
 Post-traumatic changes seen at the coracoclavicular regions bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of the right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Underlying opacities at the right lung base potentially atelectasis although
 infection is also possible.
