  Calcific density in the left suprahilar region, potentially calcified
  granuloma in the parenchyma versus calcified hilar lymph node and suspected
  additional calcified left hilar nodes suspicious for prior granulomatous
  disease.
  Hazy opacity in the right suprahilar region could also be due to a chronic
  process although acute infection would be difficult to exclude.
