                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with opioid overdose  // Eval for aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Minimal
 streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though
 early aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly low lung volumes.  Mild streaky bibasilar opacities could reflect
 atelectasis, though early aspiration is not completely excluded. Consider
 repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort for further
 assessment when the patient is able to do so.
