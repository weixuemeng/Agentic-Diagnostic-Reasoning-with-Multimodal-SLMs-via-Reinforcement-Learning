 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous and calcified at the aortic
 arch.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative changes
 noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
