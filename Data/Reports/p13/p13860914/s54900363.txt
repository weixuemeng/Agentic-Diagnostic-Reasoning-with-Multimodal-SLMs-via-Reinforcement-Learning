                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure presenting with shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Calcifications are again
 noted within the aortic arch, otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is persistently engorged but there is
 no pulmonary edema.  Segmental atelectasis at the left lung base is new or
 worsse.
 
 Transvenous leads from a left-sided pacemaker end in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.  
 2.  Increased left basilar atelectasis. Suggest repeat CXR in 4 wks.  If this
 does not clear Chest CT would be indicated to evaluate bronchial patency.
