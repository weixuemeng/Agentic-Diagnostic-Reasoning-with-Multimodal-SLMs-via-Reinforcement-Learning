                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cirrhosis, fall and altered mental
 status.  Evaluate for bleed and fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, with streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflective
 of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen, and the previously noted pulmonary nodule is below the resolution of a
 radiograph.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The heart is normal in size, and
 the mediastinal contours are normal.  A stent noted in the right upper
 quadrant abdomen is compatible with prior TIPS placement.  Displaced right
 distal clavicular fracture is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
