                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate to large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are
 new compared to the previous CT.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the
 presence of the bilateral pleural effusions but likely is not enlarged. Aorta
 is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. A stent is noted
 projecting over the midline abdomen. Pneumobilia is noted in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large right and small left pleural effusions, new compared to the
