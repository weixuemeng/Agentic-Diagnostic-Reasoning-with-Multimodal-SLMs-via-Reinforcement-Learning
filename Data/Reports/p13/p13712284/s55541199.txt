                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a new right pleural effusion, now
 status-post thoracentesis.  Re-evaluate the pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Residual small right pleural effusion status-post thoracentesis. Associated
 focal right lower and right middle lobe opacity that is most consistent with
 residual atelectasis and re-expansion pulmonary edema post-thoracentesis, less
 likely aspiration or developing infection.  Stable small left pleural effusion
 with adjacent left retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms. The left lung
 is otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Marked decrease in size of right pleural effusion with residual small
 right pleural effusion after recent thoracentesis.
 
 2.  Right middle and right lower lobe airspace opacities may reflect
 re-expansion edema following recent large volume thoracentesis, but short-term
 followup radiographs would be helpful to exclude other potential etiologies
 such as infectious pneumonia. At that time, additional airspace opacity at the
 left base may also be reassessed.
 
 3.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
