                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:26 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with CHF, vomiting and possible sepsis.  New
 hypoxia.  Is there pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, but mild interstitial pulmonary edema is
 new.  In the right lung, there is more focal consolidation in the infrahilar
 and midlung portion than on the left.  This could be asymmetric edema or
 concurrent pneumonia.  Small pleural effusion is presumed on the right, none
 appreciable on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
