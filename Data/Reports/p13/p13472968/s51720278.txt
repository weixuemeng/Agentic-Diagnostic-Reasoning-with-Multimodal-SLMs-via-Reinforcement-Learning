                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest discomfort for 20 minutes and history of
 coronary artery disease.  Evaluation for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate relatively low lung volumes with
 hazy consolidation obscuring the left heart border.  Left apical pleural
 thickening is also noted, along with a suggestion of consolidation around mild
 bronchiectasis in the left apex.  On the lateral view, an ovoid opacity
 projecting over the ascending aorta may represent a prevascular mass.  The
 right lung is essentially clear.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left apical pleural thickening, possibly scarring, with small airspace
 opacities in the left apex, along with a hazy lingular opacity which could
 represent pneumonia.  Ovoid anterior mediastinal opacity is concerning for a
 prevascular mass, and comparison with prior films would be helpful if
 available.  If not available, a dedicated chest CT is recommended for further
 evalualtion.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 9:30am on ___, at the time of attending review.
