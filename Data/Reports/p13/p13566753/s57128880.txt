                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post splenectomy, assess endotracheal tube
 position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from 2 hr earlier.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  The endotracheal tube is
 positioned with its tip 2.8 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is seen in
 the region of the distal stomach.  A drain is present in the left upper
 quadrant.  There is left basilar opacity, not significantly changed from prior
 exam.  Aside from this, no convincing abnormality.  The previously noted right
 upper lobe lung nodule is not clearly visualized.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  No free air seen below the right hemidiaphragm. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. 
 
 2. Persistent left basilar opacity which could represent infection/atelectasis
 versus aspiration.
