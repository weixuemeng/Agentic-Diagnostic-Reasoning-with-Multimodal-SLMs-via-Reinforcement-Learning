                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, chest pain and fever  // eval for
 pneumoonia, other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC. The mid to lower lung
 fields are under penetrated likely due to patient body habitus. Given this, no
 definite focal consolidation is seen although would be difficult cyst exclude
 on the right lung base. No pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process although of the study is slightly
 limited due to underpenetration of the mid to lower lung fields, particularly
 on the right, due to patient overlying soft tissue. Would be difficult to
 entirely exclude right basilar consolidation although there is not evidence of
 such on the lateral view.
