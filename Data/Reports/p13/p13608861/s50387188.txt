                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, asthma, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal contour
 is on similar.  Low lung volumes resulting in crowding of bronchovascular
 structures, but there is no overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy atelectasis is
 noted in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
