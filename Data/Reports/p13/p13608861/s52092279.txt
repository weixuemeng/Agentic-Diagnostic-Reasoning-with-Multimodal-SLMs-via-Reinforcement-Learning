 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NGT advanced  // Please confirm
 positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease opacification in the right lower hemi thorax is probably due to a
 decrease in edema and/or pleural effusion. Mild edema persists in the left
 lung. Moderate cardiomegaly has been 8 constant feature. The precise volume of
 pleural effusion is difficult to assess in a patient of this size.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The larger esophageal tube ends in the region of the pylorus or proximal
 duodenum. The smaller caliber esophageal device, presumably feeding tube ends
 just above the diaphragm. ET tube is in standard placement. Right internal
 jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
