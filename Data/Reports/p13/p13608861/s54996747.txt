                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, intubated, with cough and desaturation.  Evaluate
 for evidence of aspiration or mucous plugging.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 10:07.  Chest CT from ___ at 16:44.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned. Two enteric catheters
 course below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view
 inferiorly. There is mild to moderate bilateral mid to lower lung atelectasis
 and small pleural effusions, not significantly changed. A nodular opacity
 projecting over the right mid lung has a bandlike appearance on the preceding
 CT, likely worsening atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size
 remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged mild to moderate bilateral lower lung atelectasis, less likely
 aspiration or infection.
 2. Worsening right mid-lung atelectasis.
 3. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
