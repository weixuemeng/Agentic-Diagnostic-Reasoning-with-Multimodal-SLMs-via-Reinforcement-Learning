                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old gentleman with no relevant PMH who was transferred
 from ___ for further work up of new severe transaminitis. ? of
 infiltrative disease  // assess for acute process, enlarged mediastinum
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The appearance
 is similar to ___.
 
 Areas opacity at the right lung base extending to the level of the hilum, of
 uncertain etiology.  Immediately above this there is a small amount of
 platelike atelectasis at the right base.   Sharply defined linear lucency  is
 seen at the right base, but the significance of this is unclear.  Doubt but
 cannot entirely exclude loculated hydro pneumothorax.
 
 There is mild prominence of vessels, but no CHF.
 
 The left lung and remaining portion of the right lung is grossly clear,
 without focal infiltrate or consolidation.  No gross left effusion.
 
 Elsewhere, no pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unusual appearance at the right base, opacification and obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm-- the etiology is uncertain, as this could relate to an elevated
 hemidiaphragm, atelectasis, consolidation, pleural fluid or a combination
 thereof.  Given the sharp interface between the diaphragm and right midzone
 lung, is difficult to completely exclude a hydro pneumothorax, though that
 remains unlikely.  A lateral chest x-ray would likely be helpful in better
 understanding the opacity at the right lung base.  If feasible, a lateral
 decubitus view may also be helpful.
 
 Otherwise, no CHF or gross effusion.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared with ___.
