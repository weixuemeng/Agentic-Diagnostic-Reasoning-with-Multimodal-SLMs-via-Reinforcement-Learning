                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Minimal opacity at the
 right base is probably due to minor atelectasis.  There is a new medial left
 posterior basilar opacity and possible a small pleural effusion.  Mild loss in
 height of a mid thoracic vertebral body appears chronic and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Medial left basilar opacity, which could be seen with pneumonia,
 although atelectasis is possible; suspected trace coinciding effusion.
