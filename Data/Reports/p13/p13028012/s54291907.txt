 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided PICC whose tip is at the RA-SVC junction. 
 Previously seen right IJ central venous catheter is no longer visualized. 
 Prior enteric tube is no longer seen.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current
 exam.  There is, however, slightly increased pulmonary vascular congestion
 compared to prior.  Persistent dense retrocardiac opacity is seen silhouetting
 the left hemidiaphragm, as on prior.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity
 likely due to combination of atelectasis and effusion noting underlying
 infection is not excluded.
