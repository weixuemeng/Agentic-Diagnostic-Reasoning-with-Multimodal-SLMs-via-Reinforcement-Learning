                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening myasthenia ___, now with Dobbhoff tube placed at 1:00
 p.m.  Check placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable upright chest radiograph shows newly placed Dobbhoff
 tube with the radiodense tip beyond the gastroesophageal junction, but still
 at the expected level of the proximal stomach.  The tip of the right internal
 jugular pheresis line is at the level of the distal superior vena cava.  The
 left hemidiaphragm remains elevated and slightly obscured.  Radiodense
 material is seen in the hepatic flexure.  Note, exclusion of the apices and
 upper mediastinum from the view of the film.
 
 IMPRESSION: Feeding tube tip at expected level of proximal stomach.
