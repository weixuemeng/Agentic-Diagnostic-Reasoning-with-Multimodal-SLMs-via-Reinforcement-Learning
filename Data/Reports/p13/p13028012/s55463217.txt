                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight gain and fatigue with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular
 crowding and limiting assessment for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Trace
 pleural effusions would also be difficult to exclude.  The heart is likely
 stably enlarged with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes limit assessment if continued concern consider
 repeat study with depper inspiration.
