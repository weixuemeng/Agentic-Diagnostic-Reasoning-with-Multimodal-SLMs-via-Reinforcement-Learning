                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with substantial tortuosity of the descending aorta.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly most likely represents pleural thickening.
