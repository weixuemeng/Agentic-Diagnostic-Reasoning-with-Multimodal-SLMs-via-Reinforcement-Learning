 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myasthenia and recent PICC
 repositioning.
 
 Comparison is to prior study of ___ at 23:43.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 11:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. 
 The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet,
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
 There continues to be retrocardiac opacity with an associated effusion likely
 representing compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  The right lung is grossly clear.
