                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM: Upon re-review, there is a possible 1.5 cm  cavitary lesion vs.
 superimposed shadows on one of the two submitted projections.  This can be
 further assessed on follow up imaging.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with CHF and volume overload.  Assess edema
 and effusions.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 A portable semi-supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart remains stably enlarged most likely reflecting cardiomegaly,
 although a pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There is a
 layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac consolidation likely
 reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. Smaller right effusion is also
 possible. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with some residual perihilar
 edema on the current examination.  The endotracheal tube and right subclavian
 PICC line remain in satisfactory position.  There has been interval removal of
 the nasogastric tube.
