 patient is status post median sternotomy with valvular replacement.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  There continues to be pulmonary vascular
 congestion in the setting of low lung volumes with no overt pulmonary edema or
 focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 mildly elevated, but unchanged.  No pleural effusions are appreciated.
