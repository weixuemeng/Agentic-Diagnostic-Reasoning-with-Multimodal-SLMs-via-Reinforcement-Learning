                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia and CHF, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There are
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe opacities which
 could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Also noted is mild pulmonary
 edema with engorgement of the hilar vasculature.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 The heart size cannot be assessed.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate bilateral effusions with lower lobe consolidations,
 likely representing atelectasis/pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary edema is likely
 also present.
