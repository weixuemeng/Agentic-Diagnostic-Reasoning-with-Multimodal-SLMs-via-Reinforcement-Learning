                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Crackles on physical exam.  Evaluation for pleural effusion or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, including
 ___, dating back to ___.  Comparison is also made to chest
 CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, slightly improved on the
 left with stable appearance on the right.  There is also atelectasis within
 the right mid lung, likely due to atelctasis, however an underlying infection
 is also possible.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is stable,
 allowing for relatively low lung volumes. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased right mid-lung consolidation, likely due to atelectasis,
 however underlying infection cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions,
 slightly improved on the left and stable on the right.
