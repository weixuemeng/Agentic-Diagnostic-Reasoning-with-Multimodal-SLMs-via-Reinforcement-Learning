                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions more prominent on the right with compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.  More coalescent opacification in the right mid and
 lower zone could well represent a superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
