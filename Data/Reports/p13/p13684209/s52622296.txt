 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Prior pneumonia, evaluation for resolution.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
 improvement, with near-complete resolution of the pre-existing parenchymal
 opacities at both lung bases.  On today's image, only minimal bronchial scars
 persist.  There is no evidence of secondary changes such as regional pulmonary
 edema.  Hilar structures are unremarkable.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.
