                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are streaky retrocardiac
 opacities as well as patchy increased right infrahilar opacity, although more
 likely due to atelectasis than pneumonia.  Small osteophytes are present along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky basilar opacities, particularly in the left lower lobe. 
 Pneumonia or atelectasis could be considered to explain the findings.
