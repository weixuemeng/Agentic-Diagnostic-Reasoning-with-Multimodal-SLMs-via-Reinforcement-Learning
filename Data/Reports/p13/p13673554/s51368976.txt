                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with diastolic heart failure admitted for DOE s/p
 diuresis  // Eval for interval change, assess effusion/underlying
 consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  PA and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, there is improved vascular congestion .  There
 is persistent consolidation within the right mid and lower lung as well as
 persistent bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left.  There is also
 an opacity silhouetting the left heart border, consistent with consolidation
 within the lingula.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Again seen is the median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent consolidation of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and
 lingula consistent with known pneumonia.  Persistent bilateral pleural
 effusions right greater than left.  Improved vascular congestion bilaterally.
