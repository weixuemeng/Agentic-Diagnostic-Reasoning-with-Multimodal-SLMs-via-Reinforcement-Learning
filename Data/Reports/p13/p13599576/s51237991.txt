                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lower lobe consolidation is worrisome for pneumonia.  There
 may also be involvement of the lingula.  The right lung is essentially clear. 
 There is no large pleural effusion, although small left pleural effusion is
 difficult to exclude.  There may be a component of left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation is worrisome for pneumonia. 
 Underlying atelectasis may also be present.  Recommend followup to resolution.
