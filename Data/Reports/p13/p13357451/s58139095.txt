                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with innumerable
 liver metastases, left lower lobe pulmonary embolism on ___, now with
 delirium.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CTA from ___.
 
 CHEST, AP AND LATERAL:  There is increased moderate elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, with adjacent atelectasis.  Increased patchy opacities in the
 right lower lobe.  Left lung is well expanded and clear.  Left chest wall port
 again terminates in the distal SVC.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right lower lobe atelectasis and patchy opacities, most
 compatible with evolving pulmonary infarcts.  However, superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.
