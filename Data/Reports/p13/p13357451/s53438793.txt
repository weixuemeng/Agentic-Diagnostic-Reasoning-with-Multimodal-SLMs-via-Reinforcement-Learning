                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pancreatic cancer, recent diagnosis of
 pulmonary emboli with pulmonary infarct, presenting with fever and
 tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and CT of the chest from ___.  
 
 Right-sided port terminates in the distal SVC.  Right lateral basal opacity is
 improved from the prior study compatible with evolving multifocal infarct.
 Medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is not well seen suggesting some
 retrocardiac atelectasis which would be better assessed on a two-view film if
 the patient is able.  The heart is top normal with normal mediastinal
 contours.  CBD stent is seen in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving opacity at the right lateral base is compatible with
 evolving infarct seen on the recent CT.
