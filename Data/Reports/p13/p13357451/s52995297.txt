                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hemoptysis.  Additional history from prior CT
 scan reveals history of metastatic pancreatic cancer, on chemotherapy and
 prior, pulmonary emboli.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior chest
 x-ray from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 There has been interval progression of middle and lower lobe parenchymal
 opacities since prior chest CT.  This could be due to any combination of
 atelectasis or infection.  Possibility of infarction is also raised given
 extensive clot burden in this vascular territory.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear.  Left chest wall port with catheter tip seen in the mid SVC.  The
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  CBD stent is partially visualized in the
 upper abdomen.  The soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of right lower and middle lobe opacities, potentially
 due to infection or infarct given recent pulmonary emboli in this
 distribution.
