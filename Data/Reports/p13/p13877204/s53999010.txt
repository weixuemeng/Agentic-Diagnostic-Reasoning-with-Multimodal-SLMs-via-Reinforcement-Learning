                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:06 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with relapsed AML.  History of atrial fibrillation
 with fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Multifocal pulmonary abnormality which developed between ___ and
 ___ has continued to progress, consisting of large, almost mass-like
 regions of consolidation without clear air bronchograms or cavitation.  The
 initial velocity of the process is more suggestive of pyogenic infection or
 fulminant vasculitis* than fungal infection, but I would not exclude that. 
 Lower lung volumes exaggerate the background density of the lungs, but I doubt
 that pulmonary edema is present.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  Heart
 size top normal.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads
 in standard placements.
 
 Aggressive polyarteritis nodosa has be reported with AML, but the target organ
 is usually skin.
