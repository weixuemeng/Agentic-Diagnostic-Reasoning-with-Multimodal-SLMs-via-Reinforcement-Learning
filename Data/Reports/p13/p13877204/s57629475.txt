                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with newly diagnosed acute myelocytic
 leukemia, now with persistent cough and fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Poor inspirational effort results in
 relatively high-positioned diaphragms obscuring partially the heart shadow. 
 There is, however, no significant difference in heart size when comparison is
 made with the previous study.  The high-positioned diaphragms result in a
 crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the bases with possibly a
 linear density in retrocardiac position on the left base suggestive of a
 peripheral plate atelectasis.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot
 be identified and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any
 fluid accumulation.  The pulmonary vascular pattern is not congested and no
 pneumothorax is identified in the apical area on the frontal view.  No gross
 skeletal abnormalities on the standard views.  When comparison is made with
 the chest examination of ___, findings are stable short of the
 poor inspirational effort on today's examination.  Suggestion of trace plate
 linear atelectasis on the left base was already mentioned on the preceding
 study.
