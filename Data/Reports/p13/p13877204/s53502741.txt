                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AML, onset of AFib, evaluation for PE.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have
 substantially decreased, most likely because of a lesser inspiratory effort. 
 As a consequence, there is crowding of vascular and bronchial structures at
 both lung bases, right more than left.  The lateral image shows neither
 pathologic parenchymal processes nor a pleural effusion.  However, to safely
 rule out a pathologic process at the lung bases, a repeat radiograph in full
 inspiration should be performed.
 
 No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.  Left pectoral pacemaker, correct
 course and position of the leads.
