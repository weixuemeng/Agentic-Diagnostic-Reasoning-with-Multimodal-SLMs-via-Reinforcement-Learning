                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, cough
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Port-A-Cath is situated over the
 left chest wall with catheter extending to the level of the upper SVC by way
 of the left IJ vein.  There is persistent mediastinal prominence likely in
 part reflecting left paramediastinal fibrosis.  Persistent left basal opacity
 likely reflects persistent atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.  Right
 lung remains clear.  The heart size is grossly unchanged.  No acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of left basal opacity likely reflecting a combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.
