                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung CA, weakness  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the proximal to mid SVC without evidence
 of pneumothorax.  No priors available for comparison.  There is volume loss of
 the left lung.  Left base opacity is seen which may be due to infection,
 aspiration, chronic change, related to patient's known lung cancer.  Left
 apical opacity could be due to pleural fluid, chronicity unknown.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen on the right.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Left paratracheal opacity is seen, unclear
 whether this relates to patient's pulmonary malignancy.  Comparison with prior
 studies would be helpful for further assessment.
