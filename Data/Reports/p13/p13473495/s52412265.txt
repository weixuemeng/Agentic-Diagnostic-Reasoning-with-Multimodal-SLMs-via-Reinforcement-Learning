                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstration of moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is noted.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with edema.  There is vague increased
 opacity at the left costophrenic angle which may reflect atelectasis versus a
 small pleural effusion.  Redemonstration of a left subclavian venous stent is
 again noted.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Osseous structures
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity at left costophrenic angle likely reflects atelectasis vs. pleural
 fluid.
 
 2.  Pulmonary edema.
