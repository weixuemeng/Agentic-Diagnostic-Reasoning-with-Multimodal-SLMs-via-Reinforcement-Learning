                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with retroperitoneal bleed, anuria, and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest were obtained.  This exam is
 limited by underpenetration due to patient's body habitus and by rotation of
 the patient.  There is increased vascular congestion since previous imaging. 
 The right IJ catheter is seen with the tip in the mid to low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax or other complications are identified.  The relative radiolucency
 of the left lung compared to the right lung is likely an artifact secondary to
 patient rotation.  There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion on this
 exam.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.  New right IJ line with
 tip in the mid to low SVC.
