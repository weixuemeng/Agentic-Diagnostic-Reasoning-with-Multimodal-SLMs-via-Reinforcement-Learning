                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is similar moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged and indistinct including upper zone redistribution.  Fissures are
 thickened.  A linear opacity in the left mid lung appears unchanged and
 suggests minor scarring or atelectasis.  A left subclavian venous stent is
 again demonstrated.  There has been no significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Similar cardiomegaly. 
 Stable mediastinal contours.
