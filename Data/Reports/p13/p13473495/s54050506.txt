                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and positive blood cultures.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___ and CT chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were slightly limited due to patient's
 body habitus.  Lung volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular
 markings.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  There is mild thickening of the
 minor fissure.  Bibasilar opacities are noted.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged.  A dual-chamber dialysis catheter tip projects over proximal right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly.  Bibasilar opacities
 may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
