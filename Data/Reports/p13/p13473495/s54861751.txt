                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 2.6 cm from the carina. 
 Orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, with the tip not well
 visualized.  The heart remains severely enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema which has progressed compared to the previous study with a probable
 layering left pleural effusion.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities again
 may reflect atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  There is no large
 pneumothorax on this supine study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lying endotracheal tube with tip terminating approximately 2.6 cm above
 the carina. Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.  Worsening mild
 pulmonary edema with layering left pleural effusion.
