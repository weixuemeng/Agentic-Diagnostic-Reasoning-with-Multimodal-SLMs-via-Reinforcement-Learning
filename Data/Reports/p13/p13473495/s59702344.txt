                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with positive blood culture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lateral radiograph is essentially nondiagnostic due to underpenetration
 likely due to patient body habitus.  On frontal radiograph, lung volumes are
 low with bibasilar atelectasis.  Evaluation is somewhat limited due to patient
 body habitus.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Double-lumen central
 venous catheter appears similarly positioned.  Mild interstitial edema
 persists. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study with persistent mild interstitial edema and cardiomegaly. 
 Bibasilar opacities, atelectasis, can not exclude infection.
