 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure and renal failure, now with
 chest pain during dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is
 moderately enlarged, but stable from the prior study.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are not significantly changed from the prior radiograph
 allowing for patient rotation on the current examination.  No significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  A small amount of fluid is
 noted in the right minor fissure.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  A right
 dual-chamber dialysis catheter is in position with the tip terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction or proximal right atrium.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 gasless.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
