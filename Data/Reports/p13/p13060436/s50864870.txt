                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Edema and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The central pulmonary vasculature is
 minimally prominent which may suggest fluid overload, but without frank
 congestive heart failure.  A more focal opacity is present in the right lower
 lung, probably in the right lower lobe.  In the setting of low clinical
 concern for pneumonia, this appearance can probably be attributed to
 atelectasis but is not specific.  Minimal blunting is noted along each
 costophrenic sulcus; since these do not appear sharp, there may be very small
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of frank congestive heart failure, although perhaps
 slight fluid overload.  Patchy right infrahilar opacity, probably compatible
 with atelectasis.  If there is any potential clinical concern for pneumonia,
 then short-term followup radiographs could be considered, however, preferably
 with PA and lateral technique when feasible.
