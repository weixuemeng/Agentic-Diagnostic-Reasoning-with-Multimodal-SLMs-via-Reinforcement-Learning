                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with postobstructive PNA from likely lung CA  //
 Evaluate for interval change      Evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently one ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large right pleural effusion, probably loculated along the right chest wall,
 developed between ___ and ___, subsequently unchanged. 
 Large right hilar and infrahilar opacities may contain central cavitation.
 Differentiating cavitated mass from a postobstructive infection would be
 possible with repeat chest CT. There is no cavitation on ___.  Left
 infrahilar consolidation could be pneumonia also or atelectasis, responsible
 in part, along with the right pleural effusion, for leftward mediastinal
 shift. Heart is not enlarged. Diffuse coarse interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality, as seen on the chest CT, is probably pulmonary fibrosis in the
 setting of severe emphysema. .
