                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tracheostomy in a patient with subarachnoid
 hemorrhage with copious secretions.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place.  The tip is approaching 4.3 cm above the carina. 
 Left subclavian line tip is at the mid SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged.  Widespread parenchymal consolidations appear to be slightly
 improved since the prior study with no new consolidations demonstrated and
 might reflect gradual decrease of a combination of pulmonary edema and
 infectious process.
