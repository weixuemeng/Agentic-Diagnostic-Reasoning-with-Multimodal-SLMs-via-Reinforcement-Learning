                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with SAH, rhonchorous on exam, evaluation for edema or
 effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since prior exam with increased small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged. 
 NG tube is in the stomach.  Bibasilar increased opacities i mostly compatible
 with dependent edema, superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded
 in appropriate clinical settings.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Small bilateral pleural effusion
 has also increased.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities are probably compatible with dependent edema. 
 Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in appropriate
 clinical settings.
