                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior CT chest, most recently on ___ and
 ___ as well as PA and lateral chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left mid lung mass with a clip is reidentified with associated
 thoracotomy changes.  In the background of diffuse bilateral interstitial
 thickening, there are areas of ill defined patchy opacities in the right lower
 lung. Obscuration of the margin of the left hemidiaphragm suggests left lower
 lobe consolidation. A spine sign as well as patchy opacities in the posterior
 costophrenic sulci are seen in the lateral view. Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. There might be a small left sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Ill defined patchy opacities in both lung bases are compatible with
 pneumonia on the background of interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2.  Unchanged appearance of left mid lung mass with thoracotomy changes in the
 left lateral ribs.
