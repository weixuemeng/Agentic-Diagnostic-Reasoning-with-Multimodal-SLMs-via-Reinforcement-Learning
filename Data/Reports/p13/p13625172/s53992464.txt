                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST: Lung volumes are similar to the prior study. It is
 difficult to determine if there is a new abnormality, but there may be
 increased opacities at both lung bases since ___. Fluid is seen in the
 right major fissure. Routine oblique views would be helpful to separate
 fissural fluid from the lower lobe. 
 
 A left lung mass with an adjacent clip and thoracotomy changes is similar to
 the prior studies.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
