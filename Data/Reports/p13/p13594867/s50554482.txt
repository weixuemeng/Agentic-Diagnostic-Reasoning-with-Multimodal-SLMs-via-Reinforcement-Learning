                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for one month.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Again noted is a
 left anterior wall dual-lead pacemaker defibrillator with tips terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle as expected.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear. Slightly
 narrowed trachea appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly narrowed trachea, which may be due to suboptimal
 inspiration. Repeat chest radiograph at full end inspiration is recommended
 for further evaluation.
