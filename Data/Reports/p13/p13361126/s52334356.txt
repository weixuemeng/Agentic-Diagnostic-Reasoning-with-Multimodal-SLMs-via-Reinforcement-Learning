                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  There is slight prominence of the hila which may be due to
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema ; cannot exclude
 right hilar lymphadenopathy.  Dedicated PA and lateral views may be helpful
 for further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  Mild prominence
 of the right hilum may relate to vascular engorgement however, underlying
 lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  Dedicated PA and lateral views may be
 helpful for further evaluation.
