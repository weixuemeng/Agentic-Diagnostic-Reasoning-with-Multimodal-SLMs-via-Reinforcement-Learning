  1. Central nodular opacities, diffuse interstitial lung markings, and
  cardiomegaly likely represent cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
  
  2. Opacities in the bilateral lower lobes may represent pneumonia in the right
  clinical context.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion for 4 days  // CT head: ?ICHCXR:
 ?pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is somewhat rotated, limiting diagnostic evaluation.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST PROVIDED.
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  There are nodular opacities in the bilateral lower
 lobes. There is nodular central perihilar opacities and cardiomegaly.  There
 is increased reticular markings diffusely compatible with pulmonary
 interstitial edema.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Relative hyperlucency of the left lung apex is likely related
 to patient position and rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Central nodular opacities, diffuse interstitial lung markings, and
 cardiomegaly likely represent cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Opacities in the bilateral lower lobes may represent pneumonia in the
 right clinical context.
