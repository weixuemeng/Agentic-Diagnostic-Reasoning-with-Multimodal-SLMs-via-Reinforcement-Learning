                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA. Interval monitoring
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.  CTA of the chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again there multifocal opacities overall unchanged corresponding to known
 metastatic disease.  There is overall increased density of the right lung
 possibly reflecting increasing layering pleural effusion.  There is a
 background of mild pulmonary edema.  Left Port-A-Cath terminates in the low
 SVC.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increasing opacification of the right lung likely reflects enlarging
 pleural effusion.
 2. New mild pulmonary edema.
 3. Similar distribution of multifocal opacities corresponds to known
 metastatic disease.
