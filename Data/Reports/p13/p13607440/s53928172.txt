                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison is made to prior studies ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Extensive reticular interstitial opacities worse
 in the lower lobes and in the periphery are better evaluated in prior CT and
 consistent with interstitial lung disease.  Ground-glass opacities are better
 seen in prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  When
 compared to the radiograph on ___, there is increase in the ground-glass
 opacities.  This could be due to acute exacerbation of interstitial lung
 disease or less likely superimposed edema.
