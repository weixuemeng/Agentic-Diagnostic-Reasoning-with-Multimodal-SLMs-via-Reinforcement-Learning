 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 ventilation of both lungs.  As a consequence, there is an increase in
 transparency, notably in the region of the lung bases.  However, the
 subpleural areas bilaterally show reticular changes suggestive of fibrosis. 
 These changes are better characterized on a CT examination from ___.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema.
