                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Normal pleural surfaces.  A
 subcentimeter opacity at the left base is again seen and likely represents a
 nipple shadow.  Increased, ill-defined opacity at the right base could
 represent superimposition of normal bronchovascular structures, but early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
