                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of right pigtail pleural catheter, a
 moderate-sized right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.  There
 is no visible pneumothorax.  Large mass occupies a majority of the right upper
 and mid hemithorax, and is associated with known right upper and right middle
 lobe collapse as well as hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, better
 depicted on recent CT.  Interstitial opacities are present in the right lower
 lobe. Left lung is well expanded with a persistent left upper lobe pulmonary
 nodule as well as smaller nodular opacities seen to better detail on the CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Slight increase in size of right pleural effusion following pigtail
 pleural catheter removal, with no visible pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Large neoplastic mass in right hemithorax with associated right upper and
 right middle lobe collapse, ipsilateral lymphangitic spread of tumor,
 lymphadenopathy and contralateral lung nodules.
