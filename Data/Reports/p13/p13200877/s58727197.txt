                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of non-small lung carcinoma with mets to the
 brain, now with worsening respiratory status and altered mental status. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 AP view of the chest demonstrates interval increase in opacification of the
 right lung, which likely represents combination of pleural fluid and patient's
 known right lung mass.  Small portion of the right lung remains aerated in the
 lower lung zone, with increased opacification, likely due to overlying fluid. 
 The left lung is essentially clear.  Ill-defined opacity in the left upper
 lung likely corresponds to FDG-avid nodule seen on ___ PET-CT exam. 
 There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  There is no mediastinal shift.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 In comparison to ___ exam, there is interval progression of the right
 lung opacification, which likely reflects combination of increased pleural
 fluid, patient's known right lung mass and atelectasis.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
