                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pacemaker placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again a dual lead pacemaker/ ICD device in place with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. Small subpulmonic
 effusions are present bilaterally. Patchy retrocardiac opacity in the left
 lower lobe has increased but probably this can be attributed to atelectasis.
 The heart is enlarged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post placement of two-lead pacemaker/ICD device.  Patchy left base
 opacity, probably minor atelectasis.
