                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with breast cancer POC in place  // no blood
 return, check location of catheter tip
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal shadow is unchanged.  Left-sided prepectoral Port-A-Cath
 in situ with the tip in the distal SVC.  Right perihilar opacity is slightly
 more dense and shows a configuration change compared to prior imaging (it is
 not known of how much the decreased lung volumes contribute to this finding). 
 Interval increase in the right basilar opacity which may reflect atelectasis
 or consolidation.  Small associated pleural effusion.  Left basal atelectasis
 with small effusion unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Position of the Port-A-Cath is unchanged with its tip in the distal SVC.
 Interval increase in the right perihilar and basal opacity which is
 nonspecific and it is not known how much the low lung volumes contribute to
 this finding.
