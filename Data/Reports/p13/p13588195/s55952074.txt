                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:27 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man desaturating.  Suspect progression of pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___.  Between ___
 and ___ the patient developed a widespread heterogeneous pulmonary
 abnormality, with almost nodular appearance, that grew more confluent over the
 next two days and has improved centrally, but not peripherally.  Widespread
 infection remains the most likely cause, particularly disseminated
 staphylococcus, which can produce small abscesses which lead to pneumatoceles.
 I would strongly recommend CT scanning to clarify the nature of the pulmonary
 abnormality, particularly since relatively benign condition such as pulmonary
 edema can have this sort of appearance, if the patient has concurrent
 emphysema.
 
 Left subclavian catheter ends in the upper SVC.  Dr. ___ was
 paged at 9:15 a.m., one minute following recognition of the findings.
