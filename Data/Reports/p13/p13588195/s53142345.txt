                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, shortness of breath
 and desaturation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 As compared to prior study, there is slight interval improvement in widespread
 parenchymal opacities, although substantial involvement of the lungs is still
 noted bilaterally.  When compared to for example ___, the overall
 involvement of the lungs is more substantial.  The maximum of lung involvement
 can be assumed happening on ___, with overall minimal gradual
 improvement since then.  Given the lack of distention of the azygos vein,
 pulmonary edema is unlikely etiology.  Other possibilities such as infection
 or ARDS, or potentially exacerbation of interstitial lung disease should be
 considered.
