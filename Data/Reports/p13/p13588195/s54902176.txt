                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with increased oxygen requirement. Study
 requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior studies, the left lung demonstrates
 longstanding diffuse homogeneous opacities characterized as ground glass
 infiltrations on prior chest CT which appear stable and unchanged. Somewhat
 heterogeneous opacities on the right have evolved, with increased
 consolidations in the lateral aspect of the right lung.   
 
 This process seems to fluctuate on day-to-day basis, based on concurrent
 cardiac function. These findings may be related to pneumonitis, less likely an
 infection, and raises the possibility of a drug reaction and/or toxic
 exposure. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable diffuse homogeneous opacities in the left lung with
 heterogeneous right lung opacities and increased right peripheral
 consolidations which raise the possibility of pneumonitis as a result of a
 drug reaction and/or toxic exposure initiated in late ___.
