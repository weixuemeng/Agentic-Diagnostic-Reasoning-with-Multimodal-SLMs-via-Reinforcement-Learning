 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral pulmonary opacities are somewhat improved since the prior study of
 ___.  The cardiac silhouette is obscured by these opacities but is
 grossly normal.  The mediastinum and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved but persistent bilateral opacities which are better characterized on
 recent CT of the chest compatible with pneumonitis.
