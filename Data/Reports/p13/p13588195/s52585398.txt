                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  AAA, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly increased.  This could be the effect of increased ventilatory
 pressure.  As a consequence, the extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion
 is slightly less severe than before.  Moreover, the areas of basal atelectasis
 have overall decreased, right more than left.  Small effusions persist.  Also
 persisting are signs of mild fluid overload.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 appearance of the aortic contour.
