                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with increasing agitation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is no.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with emphysematous
 changes again visualized.  Interstitial and streaky opacities are most
 pronounced at the lung bases with bronchial wall thickening, more pronounced
 in the left lung base, suggestive of chronic airway inflammation and
 potentially infection or aspiration.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is present.  Hazy ovoid opacity within the right mid lung
 field seen likely corresponds to the previously radiofrequency ablated lesion
 in the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema with persistent bibasilar opacities, more pronounced in the left
 lung base, suggestive of chronic airway inflammation and potentially infection
 or aspiration, not substantially changed from the previous radiograph.
