                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sp intubation  // sp intubation eval placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is
 growth within the stomach.
 
 A 2 cm irregularly marginated nodular opacity is present in the right upper
 lobe between the levels of the first and second anterior ribs.  Lungs are
 otherwise remarkable for predominantly left-sided interstitial opacities. 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  With pleural thickening in the left mid and lower hemi thorax
 appears slightly nodular.  Periphery of right mid and lower hemi thorax have
 been excluded from the radiograph, precluding full assessment of the lung
 parenchyma and pleura in this region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2 cm right upper lobe nodule and nodular left pleural thickening are
 concerning for malignancy.
 
 Predominately left-sided interstitial opacities could potentially represent
 asymmetrical edema but lymphangitic carcinomatosis may produce a similar
 radiographic appearance.
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Recommend contrast-enhanced CT of the chest for further
 evaluation.
