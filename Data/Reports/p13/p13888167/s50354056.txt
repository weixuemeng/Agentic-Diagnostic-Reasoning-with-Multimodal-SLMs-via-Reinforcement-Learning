                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right lower lobe
 nodule for interval change.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  There is interval improvement
 of the aeration of the lung bases that might be consistent with interval
 resolution of infectious process.  Pulmonary nodule seen on the prior
 examination is not clearly visible on the current study but reassessment in
 three months for complete resolution, including anterior oblique views, might
 be considered.  Mild hyperinflation is noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
