                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with double lumen PICC not drawing blood s/p
 TPA  // placement of PICC?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 LEFT PICC HAS CHANGED IN POSITION, NOW MAKING AN ABRUPT SUPERIOR AND MEDIAL
 TURN AT THE LEVEL OF THE RIGHT TRACHEOBRONCHIAL ANGLE. PRECISE POSITIONING OF
 THE CATHETER IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ON THE SINGLE VIEW, BUT IT IS MOST
 LIKELY LOCATED WITHIN THE AZYGOS VEIN. ALTERNATIVELY, IT COULD BE COILED
 WITHIN THE LEFT BRACHIOCEPHALIC VEIN. LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH WOULD BE
 HELPFUL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE LOCATIONS. EXAM IS OTHERWISE REMARKABLE
 FOR LINEAR BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS, SLIGHTLY IMPROVED ON THE RIGHT.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 3:07 PM, 1 minute after discovery of the
 findings.
