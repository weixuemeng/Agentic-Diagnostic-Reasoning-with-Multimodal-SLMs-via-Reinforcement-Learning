                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple falls. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___ and
 T-spine radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post aortic valve replacement. The sternotomy wires are
 intact. Mediastinal clips are redemonstrated.
 
 Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. However the
 interstitial markings are significantly more pronounced compared with prior
 exams and there is upper vascular redistribution suggesting mild interstitial
 edema. Patchy opacities in both lower lobes, including a retrocardiac bandlike
 opacity better seen in the lateral view, are not significantly changed
 compared with prior T-spine radiograph and likely represent fibrotic changes.
 There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiac size cannot be properly evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with associated small left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Stable fibrotic changes in both lung bases. No definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
