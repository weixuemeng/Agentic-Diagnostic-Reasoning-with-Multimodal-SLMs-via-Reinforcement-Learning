                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sore throat, rhonchi on lung exam  // Please
 eval for any infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient status post aortic valve replacement.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact and well aligned.  Mediastinal clips are again seen.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac size is difficult to assess.  Interstitial
 markings are prominent, similar to the prior examination.  Patchy opacities
 are seen in the bilateral lower lobes, which are not significantly changed
 since the prior examination.  However, consolidation is not definitively
 excluded.  Bandlike retrocardiac opacity is again seen.  Again seen is a small
 left-sided pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No definite acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Overall similar bilateral
 opacities to prior examination, though pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
