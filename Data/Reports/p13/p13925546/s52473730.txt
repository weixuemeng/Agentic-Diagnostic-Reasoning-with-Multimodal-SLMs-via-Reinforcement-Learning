                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new ETT  // eval for ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral views of the chest from 3 hours prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement
 of an endotracheal tube and transesophageal tube.  The endotracheal tube
 terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina.  The tip of the
 transesophageal tube projects over the region of the stomach.  Since the prior
 examination, there has been progressive bibasilar opacities, which may
 represent atelectasis, though infiltrate is not excluded.  A left-sided
 pleural effusion is likely present.  There is no large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and transesophageal tube are in adequate position.
 2.  Progressive basilar opacities may represent atelectasis, though infiltrate
 is not excluded.
