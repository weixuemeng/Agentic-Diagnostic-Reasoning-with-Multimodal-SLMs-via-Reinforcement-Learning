 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is an irregularly-shaped calcific density projected to the left of the
 eighth thoracic vertebra. This is projected over the left lower lobe. The
 lungs appear otherwise clear. The heart and mediastinal structures are
 unremarkable in appearance. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Calcific density projects over the left lower lobe. This is likely a skeletal
 deformity related to skeletal trauma but the appearance is not specific.  It
 may be helpful to compare with prior, outside x-rays. Alternatively, CT could
 be performed for further evaluation.
