                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery
 multivessel disease after catheterization with stenting and currently with
 fever and sputum production.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular line tip
 is at the cavoatrial junction.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable, but there is new right mid and lower
 lung consolidation with air bronchogram but given the rapidity of development
 is highly concerning for aspiration.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia
 are possible, especially in the light of patient's fever.  Left basal opacity
 is noted, overall unchanged.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen in the rest of
 the lungs.
