                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with epiphrenic diverticula, rule out free air or
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Barium esophagram from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a retrocardiac lucency with a thick wall.  Question if this is
 related to a hiatal hernia, but none seen on prior barium swallow study.  Does
 not appear to correspond to known epiphrenic diverticula.  Cannot exclude a
 pulmonary process.  Linear atelectasis is seen in the left mid lung. There is
 no effusion or pneumothorax.  The there is mild cardiomegaly.  There are old
 right sided rib deformites. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac lucency with a thick wall.  Question whether this is related to a
 hiatal hernia, but given that none was seen on the prior barium swallow,
 pulmonary process not excluded.  PA and lateral views or CT scan of the chest
 may be helpful to further evaluate.
