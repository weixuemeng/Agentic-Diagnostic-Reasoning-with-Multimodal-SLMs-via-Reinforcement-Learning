  Retrocardiac air fluid level - may represent a hiatal hernia.  However, given
  prior UGI findings, could also represent fluid in an enlarged esophageal
  diverticulum.  Correlation with follow-up UGI or endoscopy recommended.  No
  pneumomediastinum and no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
  atelectasis.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.   No edema or pleural effusions.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of esophageal diverticula, assessment for retrocardiac
 opacity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the radiograph now
 demonstrates a hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level and an overall diameter
 of approximately 8 cm.  The areas of scarring at the left lung base and the
 old rib lesions on the right are unchanged.  No other relevant changes.
