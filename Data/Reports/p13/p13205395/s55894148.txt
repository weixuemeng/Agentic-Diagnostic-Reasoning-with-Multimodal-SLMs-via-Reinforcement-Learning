                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, elevated white count, status post laparoscopic
 appendectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, and there is volume loss at both bases, right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The stomach is slightly distended.  There are
 multiple dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 4 cm with air-fluid
 levels.  Only the superior portion of the abdomen can be visualized, and
 therefore assessment of small-bowel obstruction versus ileus cannot be made on
 this film.
