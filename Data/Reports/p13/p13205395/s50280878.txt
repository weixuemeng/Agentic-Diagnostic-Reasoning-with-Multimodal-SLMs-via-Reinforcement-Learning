 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Status post appendectomy with new onset hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, which limits assessment.  The stomach is
 distended.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is hazy bilateral
 vasculature, but it is unclear how much of this is due to poor inspiration. 
 Patchy areas of volume loss are seen bilaterally.  The right hilum is
 prominent, but it is unclear how much of this is due to low volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes limit assessment.  Pulmonary edema and infection
 are both possibilities.  Recommend followup to reassess the hilum when the
 patient is in more stable pulmonary status.
