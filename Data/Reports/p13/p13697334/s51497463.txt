                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status  // ?focal
 consolidation      ?focal consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal
 or slightly enlarged.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
 some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  There is suggestion of some
 asymmetric opacification at the right base.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could possibly represent superimposed pneumonia.  If the
 condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could be most helpful.
