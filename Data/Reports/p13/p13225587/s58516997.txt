                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, question pneumonia or fluid
 overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Three views of the chest.  There are interstitial opacities in the
 right lung, which may represent diffuse multifocal pneumonia or aspiration. 
 Given differences in technique, this appears similar to prior study.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely multifocal pneumonia or aspiration in the right lung.
