                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with dyspnea, cough, interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heterogeneous opacities of the right lung, worrisome for an infectious
 process, have slightly improved.  There is new minimal focal opacity at the
 left lung base which is probably due to atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
