                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  There are low lung volumes which
 accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Patchy left basilar opacity could be
 due to atelectasis versus aspiration versus infection.  No large pleural
 effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude
 given the low lung volumes.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patient rotated to the left.  Low lung volumes.  Patchy left basilar opacity
 could relate to atelectasis versus aspiration versus infection.
