                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain, history of PE, on Coumadin, assess
 acute abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is mild
 linear density in the left lung base which likely represents a small amount of
 atelectasis.  Aside from this, lungs are well expanded.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal linear atelectasis at the left lung base.  Otherwise,
 normal.
