                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain radiating to back.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are remain relatively hyperinflated, with flattening in the diaphragms, which
 may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The mediastinal contours
 are stable.  The hilar contours are also stable.  The cardiac silhouette is
 not enlarged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Subacute to old lateral right-sided rib fractures
 involving the right eighth and ninth and possibly tenth ribs are again seen. 
 No new fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Persistently hyperinflated
 lungs suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Old lateral right-sided
 rib fractures, as above.
