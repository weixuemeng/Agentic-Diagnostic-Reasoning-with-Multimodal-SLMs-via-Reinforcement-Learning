                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  Patient presents
 with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Allowing for differences in technique, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A linear opacity projecting
 over the right mid lung suggests minor atelectasis.  Slight posterior
 opacification in each costophrenic angle is of uncertain significance but
 could also be seen with minor atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  The bony structures appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacities most suggestive of minor atelectasis; pneumonia
 is unlikely but follow-up radiographs could be considered if there are
 pulmonary signs or symptoms.
