                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with lactate elevation, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT thoracic spine ___ at 15:31, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  A left-sided AICD device
 is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 unchanged.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are re- demonstrated.  Lung volumes are low.  There is crowding
 of bronchovascular structures without frank pulmonary edema.  Dense
 retrocardiac opacification likely reflects aspiration, as seen on the previous
 CT, with a small left pleural effusion.  Patchy right basilar opacity may also
 reflect a second area of aspiration or atelectasis.  Remote right-sided rib
 fractures are noted.  Multiple clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.  Sclerotic lesion in the left humeral head may reflect an
 enchondroma or bone infarct.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dense retrocardiac opacification most likely reflective of aspiration and
 small left pleural effusion, as seen on the previous CT of the thoracic spine.
 2. Probable additional area of aspiration in the right lung base versus
 atelectasis.
