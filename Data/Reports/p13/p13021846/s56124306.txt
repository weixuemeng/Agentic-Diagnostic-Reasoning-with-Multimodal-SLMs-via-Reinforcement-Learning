                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of aortic insufficiency, now intubated, here to evaluate
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 04:12.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is unchanged with the tip terminating at the
 level of the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm
 and out of view on this image.  Large layering pleural effusions are unchanged
 with opacification at the bilateral bases and retrocardiac opacification
 suggesting compressive bibasilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion/edema is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains top normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Persistent large layering pleural effusions with compressive bibasilar
 atelectasis.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/edema is unchanged.
