                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 414 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aortic insufficiency and endocarditis. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema after diuresis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ at 355.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 414 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There is
 persistent mild to moderate pulmonary edema which does not appear to be
 significantly changed since the prior study.  Persistent retrocardiac
 consolidation is seen, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the
 setting of layering bilateral effusions.  Soft tissue opacity in the right
 paratracheal area is felt to likely reflect a distended azygos vein due to the
 fluid replete state.
