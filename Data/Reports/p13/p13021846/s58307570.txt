 FINDINGS and IMPRESSION
 
 Diffuse coarse interstitial abnormality throughout the lungs could be edema
 because there is si pulmonary vascular engorgement, even though heart size is
 normal, and fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle could be due to
 azygos distension.  However there is quite likely a mass at the medial aspect
 of the right apical chest either lung, pleural or mediastinal, deviating the
 trachea slightly leftward.  An alternative explanation of the findings is lung
 cancer locally invasive, with mediastinal nodal and diffuse pulmonary
 metastases, or interstitial pneumonia and reactive adenopathy.  CT scan would
 distinguish among these possiblities. Dr ___ was paged at 9:30am.
