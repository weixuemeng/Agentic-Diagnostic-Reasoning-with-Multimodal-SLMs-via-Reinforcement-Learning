                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:56 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with an aortic valve abscess.  Recently intubated. 
 Check ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2:42 a.m. on ___:
 
 A confusing ray of internal and external portions of tubing projects over the
 neck and upper mediastinum.  I can see an endotracheal tube ending at the
 thoracic inlet and an orogastric tube passing into the stomach and out of
 view.  There is also drainage tubing projecting largely between the spinal
 stabilization elements.  I discussed with the ordering physician, ___. ___,
 ___ need to repeat subsequent chest radiographs with external tubing clearly
 delineated by repositioning it.
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened since ___ and is
 accompanied by a substantial volume of pleural effusion on both sides of the
 chest, also probably increased.  Heart size is normal.  At some point, an
 erect chest radiograph should be obtained to assess the size of these pleural
 effusions.  There is no obvious pneumothorax.
