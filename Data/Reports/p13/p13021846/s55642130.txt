                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fevers, cough, chest pain, history of
 endocarditis who presents for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 10 cm from the carina and must
 be advanced approximately 3-cm.  The heart size is normal.  There has been
 interval improvement of the pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild bilateral
 pulmonary edema.  There has been an interval increase in bibasilar
 atelectasis. Again seen is the opacity in the medial aspect of the right
 apical chest, unchanged from the prior exam, for which a CT is recommended for
 further evaluation.  No new focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or
 pneumothoraces are identified.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  ET tube terminates approximately ___-cm from the carina and must be
 advanced approximately 3-cm.
 
 3.  Slight interval worsening of bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 4.  Unchanged right apical opacity for which a dedicated CT scan of the chest
 is again recommended for further evaluation.
 
 ET tube findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11AM by Dr. ___,
 by telephone, on the day of the exam.
