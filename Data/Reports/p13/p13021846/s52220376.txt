                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with possible aspiration, here to evaluate for evidence
 of pulmonary edema or aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 11:02.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating just below the thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with predilection for the
 bilateral lung bases appears unchanged from the most recent prior study,
 likely a combination of large bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
 Retrocardiac opacification is unchanged.  In the appropriate clinical context,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged position of support devices.
 2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. In the appropriate
 clinical context, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
