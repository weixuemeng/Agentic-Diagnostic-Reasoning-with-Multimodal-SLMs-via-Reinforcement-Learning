                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 little overall change.  Again there are large bilateral pleural effusions with
 pulmonary edema.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly not
 be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Endotracheal tube remains in good position.
