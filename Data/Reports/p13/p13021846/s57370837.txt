                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute aortic regurgitation, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications most consistent with pleural
 effusions and pulmonary edema.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
