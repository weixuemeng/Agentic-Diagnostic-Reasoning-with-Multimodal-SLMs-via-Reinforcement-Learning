                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have slightly improved since the prior exam.  Mild increased
 opacity in the right infrahilar region as compared to the prior exam may
 reflect early bronchopneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  The left
 lung is clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum is not widened.  No acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 There is nonspecific gaseous distension of loops of small bowel and a
 fluid-filled stomach in the left upper quadrant, incompletely assessed on this
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Slight increased opacity in the right infrahilar region may reflect early
 bronchopneumonia.
 
 2.  Nonspecific air-filled small bowel loops in the left upper quadrant,
 incompletely imaged.
