                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a new pacemaker.  Evaluate position of leads.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses from the right axillary pacemaker.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.  Lungs are clear, and the heart size
 is normal.  Sternal wires are fractured, as they were prior to pacemaker
 placement.  Sternal wound lucency is more readily visible on today's study
 than previous ones, but probably unchanged acutely.  Also reflects non-___
 of the sternum which is probably responsible for the wire fractures.
