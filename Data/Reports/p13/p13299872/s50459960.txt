                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with R IJ CVL placement  // eval line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs most recent on ___ at 22:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carinal. A right internal
 jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube is
 coiled within the stomach.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable from the most recent prior
 exam. Bibasilar opacities, which could be related to atelectasis or aspiration
 are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is decreased
 interstitial prominence from the prior examination consistent with improved
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis or aspiration. 
 Decreased interstitial prominence consistent with improved pulmonary edema.
