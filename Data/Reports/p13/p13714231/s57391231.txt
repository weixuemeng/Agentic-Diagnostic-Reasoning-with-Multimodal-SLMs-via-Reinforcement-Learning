                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___
 and correlation with CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Focal consolidation is seen probably in the left lower lobe. 
 Multiple bilateral patchy opacities could also more generally represent
 superinfection in this patient with known bronchiectasis at the bases, left
 greater than right.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A trace left pleural effusion
 may be present.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increasing bibasilar opacification particularly in the left lower
 lobe worrisome for pneumonia superimposed on background findings of
 bronchiectasis and scarring.
