                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchiectasis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are coarse
 interstitial markings at the bases consistent with the diagnosis of
 bronchiectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, it would be extremely difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia, especially posteriorly at the left base.
 
 Upper lungs are within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular
 congestion.
