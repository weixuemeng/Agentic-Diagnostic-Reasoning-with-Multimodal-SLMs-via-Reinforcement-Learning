                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___'s, acute onset of shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is noted. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal patchy opacity is demonstrated
 within the lower lobes on the lateral view, but difficult to localize on the
 frontal view, possibly within the left lower lobe.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity within the lower lobe, possibly the left lower lobe, which
 could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
