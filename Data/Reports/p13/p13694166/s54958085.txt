 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 6 cm above the
 carina. Dobbhoff tube extends to the body of the stomach. The cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper limits and normal or mildly enlarged. There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Poor definition of the left
 costophrenic angle could reflect a small effusion, though it may only be a
 manifestation of overlying soft tissues. No acute focal pneumonia.
 In the right upper zone, there is suggestion of a nodular opacification
 adjacent to the inferior aspect of the fourth posterior rib. This could well
 represent merely a combination of shadows, but should be evaluated on
 subsequent images.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   This information was conveyed to Dr. ___.
