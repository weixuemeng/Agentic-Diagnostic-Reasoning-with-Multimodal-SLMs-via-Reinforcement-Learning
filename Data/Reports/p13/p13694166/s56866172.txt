                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the neck
 with right sided facial swelling; recent PET scan showing progression
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Right
 upper and lower lobe perihilar consolidative opacities are again demonstrated
 with continued increased interstitial markings in the right lower lobe, not
 substantially changed in the interval allowing for differences in modalities. 
 Right lateral and basilar pleural thickening is also similar.  The left lung
 is clear.  No pulmonary edema, left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 present.  Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite interval change in right upper and lower lobe perihilar
 consolidative opacities which remain concerning for malignancy with continued
 right lateral and basilar pleural thickening.  Increased interstitial markings
 in the right lower lobe remain concerning for lymphangitic spread of tumor.
