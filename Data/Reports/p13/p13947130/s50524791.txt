                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath, cough  // assess for
 ILD, infiltrate      SOB, COUGH ASSESS  FOR INFILTRATE
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small layering bilateral pleural effusions have increased since ___. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable since ___.  Previous interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality, manifested in the thickened septal lines has improved, probably
 mild edema.  Nevertheless there is a heterogeneous ground-glass opacity
 distributed in the lower lung zones, best appreciated on the lateral view,
 that could be diffuse infiltrative lung disease such as desquamative or
 nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.
 
 Chest CT scanning would be helpful in defining that abnormality.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Routine noncontrast chest CT.
