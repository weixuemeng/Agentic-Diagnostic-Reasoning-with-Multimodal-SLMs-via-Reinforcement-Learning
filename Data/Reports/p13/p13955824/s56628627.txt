                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rhonchi and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes. 
 On the frontal view, there is mild asymmetry of opacification in the lower
 lung medially on the left.  This could merely reflect crowding of vessels. 
 However, if there are appropriate clinical symptoms, the possibility of a
 developing consolidation could be considered, even though this is not
 definitely appreciated on lateral radiograph.
