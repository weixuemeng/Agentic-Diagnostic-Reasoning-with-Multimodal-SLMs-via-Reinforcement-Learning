                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pregnancy and sepsis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 5:07
 a.m.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.1 cm above the carina. 
 There is a right IJ central line with distal tip in the proximal right atrium.
 This could be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement.  There are
 again seen low lung volumes and diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally.  This
 is consistent with pneumonia given the patient's Gram negative cocci
 bacteremia and sepsis.  There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port
 are below the gastroesophageal junction and there is a single loop within the
 distal NG tube.  No pneumothoraces are present.
