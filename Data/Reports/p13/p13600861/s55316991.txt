 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with NG tube placed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 ET tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line is in right upper
 atrium.  An NG tube ends in the stomach.  Bilateral lung ground glass
 opacities are unchanged. Left lower lobe consolidation has slightly improved
 since the previous exam.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position, including the new NG tube.
 
 2.  Stable bilateral lung opacities and slightly improved left lower lung
 consolidation are more typical for microorganisms like mycoplasma or viral
 pneumonia rather than bacterial pneumonia.
