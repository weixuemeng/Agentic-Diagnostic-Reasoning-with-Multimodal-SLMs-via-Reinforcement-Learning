 INDICATION:  ___M h/o cirrhosis   s/p open appy, now with rising WBC  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As on the prior study there is a large right effusion and volume loss in the
 right lower lobe.  On the prior exam there was a small amount of opacity in
 the retrocardiac region.  This is now more confluent and is more suspicious
 for an infectious infiltrate.  The upper lobes are relatively clear.  The
 right IJ line is unchanged.

 Increased left lower lobe infiltrate.  No change in large right effusion.
