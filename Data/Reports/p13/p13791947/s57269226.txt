                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, ascites and appendicitis
 w/subsequent ileus and NGT placement previously too high recommending
 advancement of 8cm  // confirm tube placement after recommending adjustment.
 Pt claims adjusted overnight, but primary team did not. Also progression of
 effusion and ?RUL consolidation c/f PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The enteric tube terminates in the GE junction.  The lung volume is small. 
 The left lung is clear.  Right mid lung opacity has improved.  Right lower
 lung consolidation is grossly unchanged which is partially contributed to by
 atelectasis with evidence of volume loss.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 Underlying right pleural effusion is presumed and unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  NG tube terminate in GE junction.
 
 2.  Right mid lung opacity has improved likely atelectasis.
 
 3.  Persistent right lower lung consolidation, at least partially atelectasis.
 Pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
