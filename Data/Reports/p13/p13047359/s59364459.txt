                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhagic lesion.  Status post orogastric and
 endotracheal tube placement.  Evaluate position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The newly placed
 endotracheal tube ends 5.5 cm above the level of the carina.  An enteric
 catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending within the mid to
 low stomach.  Lung volumes are very low, causing exaggeration of the heart
 size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is minimal
 bilateral lower lung atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  An ovoid radiopaque structure overlying the left
 humeral head could reflect a suture anchor from prior surgery.  Surgical clips
 seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  High positioning of the endotrahceal tube.  Recommend advancing by 2-3 cm.
 
 2.  Very low lung volumes with bilateral areas of lower lung atelectasis.
