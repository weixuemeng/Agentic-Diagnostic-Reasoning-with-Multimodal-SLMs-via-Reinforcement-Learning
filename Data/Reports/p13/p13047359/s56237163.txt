                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  GVM and intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the basilar bronchovascular markings. 
 There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is likely due to low lung volumes.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable given differences in patient position and low lung
 volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
