                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New bleed.  Please evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal contours.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  Hazy pulmonary
 vasculature is identified with faint patchy opacities in the perihilar and
 upper lung zones suggests a mild degree of pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac
 opacities likely represent atelectasis, though developing infectious process
 cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural
 effusion though this area is not well evaluated due to overlying medical
 devices.  No osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with retrocardiac capacity likely
 representing atelectasis though cannot exclude infection. Possible small riht
 pleural effusion.
