                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma, possible right rib fracture and pulmonary contusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes have increased substantially, now hyperinflated indicative of
 emphysema.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lung projecting over the third
 anterior rib is no longer evident and could be resolving contusion.  With deep
 inspiration, there is a suggestion of a 12 mm wide nodule at the base of the
 right lung, previously obscured by elevated hemidiaphragm.  I would repeat a
 chest x-ray in four weeks with shallow obliques to see if this is a real
 finding.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement or edema.
