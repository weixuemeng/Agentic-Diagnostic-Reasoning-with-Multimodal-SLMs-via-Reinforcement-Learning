                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Change in mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is slight increase in opacity at the
 right lung base as compared to the prior study, raising concern for underlying
 consolidation and this could be better evaluated with addition of lateral
 view.  There is sclerosis at the posterolateral right eighth rib, question of
 prior rib fracture.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable increased density at the right lung base could be
 due to an early pneumonia, although lateral view would be helpful for further
 evaluation.  Increased sclerosis at the posterolateral right eighth rib. 
 Correlates to subacute to old rib fracture on subsequent CT.
