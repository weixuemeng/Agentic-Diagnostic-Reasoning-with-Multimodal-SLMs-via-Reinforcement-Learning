                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question aspiration, new O2 requirement and cough.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared with the earlier film and allowing for technical differences, there
 is some increased patchy opacity at both lung bases.  The differential
 diagnosis includes pneumonic infiltrates and aspiration.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, slightly more pronounced than the earlier film.  However,
 this could be accentuated by lower lung volumes.  No other evidence of CHF. 
 No effusion.  Left-sided pacemaker with lead tip over right ventricle and
 upper abdominal surgical clips again noted.  Incidental note made of severe
 right glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis, with possible prior fracture of the
 proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities at both bases could
 nonetheless reflect aspiration and/or pneumonia.
