                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with oxygen desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer
 device with a single lead overlying the right ventricle, a right PICC
 terminating in the low SVC, and clips projecting over the midline upper
 abdomen.  There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 Increased opacity over the medial right lower lung and left lower hemi thorax,
 with retrocardiac opacity, may be related to layering pleural effusions.  A
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.  New
 left mediastinal shift is concerning for left lower lobe atelectasis. There is
 no pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacity in the medial right lower lung and left lower lung, with
 retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to bilateral pleural effusions.  However, a
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.  New
 left lower lobe atelectasis.
