                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypertension and bradycardia, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased.  The lungs are
 symmetrically well aerated without focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged and there is no frank pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size allowing for low inspiratory lung
 volumes.  Mild calcification at the aortic knob is noted and there is mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinum is within normal limits
 otherwise.  The visualized upper abdomen shows multiple surgical clips in the
 left upper abdomen, unchanged from the prior study.  Degenerative changes of
 the right glenohumeral joint are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Overall,
 unchanged chest radiograph from ___.
