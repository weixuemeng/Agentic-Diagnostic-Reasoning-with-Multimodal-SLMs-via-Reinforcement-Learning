                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pacemaker, clearance for MRI.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.
 
 The heart size remains within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened to a
 moderate degree and shows some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of
 the arch, but there is no evidence of any local contour abnormality.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  Similar as on the previous
 examination, the central pulmonary vessels are rather prominent and widened, a
 finding which may be related to chronic pulmonary hypertension.  There is no
 evidence of any acute pulmonary infiltrate.  Similar as on the preceding
 examination, a permanent pacer (___) is identified in left anterior
 axillary position, seen to connect to a single intracavitary electrode, the
 tip of which reaches into the area of the apical portion of the right
 ventricle.  Skeletal structures demonstrate mild-to-moderate degenerative
 changes mostly in the mid portion of the thoracic spine, but no other gross
 skeletal abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Single electrode permanent pacer in unchanged appropriate
 position in comparison with the next preceding similar study ___ ___. 
 Stable chest findings.
