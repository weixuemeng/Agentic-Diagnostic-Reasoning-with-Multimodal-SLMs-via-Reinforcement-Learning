                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aspiration.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle.  Substantial enlargement
 of pulmonary arteries is unchanged consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
 Lungs are clear with no evidence of pulmonary edema or focal consolidation to
 suggest aspiration.  Small amount of pleural effusion is better appreciated on
 the lateral view but unclear on what side since the costophrenic sulci were
 excluded bilaterally.
