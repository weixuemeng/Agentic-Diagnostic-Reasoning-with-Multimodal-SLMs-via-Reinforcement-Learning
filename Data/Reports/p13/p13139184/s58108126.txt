                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating
 in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively, as well as a third lead in
 the coronary sinus.  The heart appears again mild-to-moderately enlarged. 
 There is bilateral perihilar enlargement with indistinctness central pulmonary
 vasculature.  Heterogeneous opacities seem to affect both lower lungs. 
 Lateral views suggest trace pleural effusions.  Fissures are also thickened. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary edema.  Coinciding pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude, particularly at the right lung base; correlation with
 clinical presentation is recommended.
