                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Battery pack
 overlies the left mid hemithorax.  There is blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles which may be due to trace pleural effusion.  Mild
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature is stable, suggesting small
 pulmonary edema.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  Hilar contours are
 stable.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
