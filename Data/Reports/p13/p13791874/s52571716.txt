                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia diagnosed at outside hospital one
 month ago  // f/u pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pacemaker leads are in unchanged
 position.  No pleural effusions.  Pre described combined vascular and
 interstitial opacities well likely caused by mild pulmonary edema that has
 completely resolved. On the current image no evidence is seen of parenchymal
 opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
