                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Severely
 enlarged cardiac silhouette is again seen.  Small left greater than right
 pleural effusions remain.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No displaced fracture, however, if clinical concern for fracture persists
 of the ribs, suggest dedicated rib series, which is more sensitive.
 2.  Persistent severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
