                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Post-chemotherapy fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Port-A-Cath resides
 over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the level of the mid
 to low SVC.  There is vague patchy opacity in the left mid lung which is
 concerning for an early pneumonia.  Otherwise, the lungs appear essentially
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left mid lung opacity likely represents early pneumonia.
