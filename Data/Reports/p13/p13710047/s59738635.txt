 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portal semi-supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.

 1.  Interval intubation with endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina.  A right
 internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  Interval development
 of diffuse bilateral airspace process which given the rapidity of development,
 likely reflects moderate pulmonary edema rather than an acute infectious
 process.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Heart remains upper limits of
 normal in size.  No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.
