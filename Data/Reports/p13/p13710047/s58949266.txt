                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 438 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure requiring
 intubation, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 438 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath, left internal jugular central line,
 nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position.
 
 2.  Interval improvement in aeration throughout both lungs with persistent
 bilateral airspace process suggesting resolving pulmonary edema.  There is
 persistent retrocardiac consolidation which may represent partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There are likely layering bilateral effusions.  Given the
 interval change, a diffuse infectious process or ARDS would be less likely. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
