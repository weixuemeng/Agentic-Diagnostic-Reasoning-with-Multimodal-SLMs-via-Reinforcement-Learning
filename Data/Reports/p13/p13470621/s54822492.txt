                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with neck pain, h/o cad w/ cabg  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, suggesting
 background COPD. The heart is at the upper limits of normal in size.  Multiple
 mediastinal surgical clips are noted. Mild prominence of the pulmonary hila
 with a tapered appearance raises the question of background pulmonary
 hypertension. Prominence of the left paratracheal soft tissues is similar to
 the chest x-ray from ___ and likely accentuated by slight rotation.
 There is linear atelectasis and/or scarring at left greater than right lung
 bases. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is noted. No CHF, focal
 infiltrate, gross effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Probable background COPD. Prominence of the hila raises the possibility of
 pulmonary hypertension.
 2. No CHF or focal infiltrate identified. No findings suggestive of an acute
 pulmonary process.
 3. Minimal linear bibasilar atelectasis/ scarring and minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles noted. This appearance is similar, but slightly improved, 
 compared with a chest x-ray from ___
