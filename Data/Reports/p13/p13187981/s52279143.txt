                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  s/p transplant with new fevers. rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly, with left ventricular configuration.  The
 aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded.  No CHF, frank consolidation, or
 effusion is identified.  However, there is some atelectasis at the right base,
 which is new compared with the prior study.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis
 at the left base is grossly unchanged.  Anterior compression of two mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies is again noted, unchanged, with loss of height of
 several vertebral bodies in the lower thoracic spine, also probably unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  New patchy opacity at the right base likely represents atelectasis, though
 an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  
 2.  Background COPD and cardiomegaly are unchanged.  No CHF.
 3.  Multiple thoracic compression fractures, unchanged.
