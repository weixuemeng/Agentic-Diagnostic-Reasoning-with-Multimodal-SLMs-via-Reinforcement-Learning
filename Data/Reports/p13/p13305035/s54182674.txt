                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of stroke, for placement of
 Dobbhoff tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the one from the same
 day at 3:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new Dobhoff tube with the tip at the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Again visualized is a left subclavian central venous catheter with
 the tip at the superior cavoatrial junction.  Median sternotomy wires appear
 intact.
 
 Bibasilar opacities are visualized, greater on the left than the right. There
 is mild pulmonary edema. Cardiac silhouette appears stable and enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is at the gastroesophageal junction.  Otherwise, no change
 in comparison to prior study from earlier the same day. It is worth noting
 that the opacity at the left lung base is likely representative of atelectasis
 but a developing pneumonia must be excluded in the proper clinical setting.
