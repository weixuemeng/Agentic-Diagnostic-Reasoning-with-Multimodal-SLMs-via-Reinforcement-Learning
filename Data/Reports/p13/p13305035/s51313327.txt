                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:51.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cerebellar stroke and newly placed
 nasogastric tube, evaluate for positioning.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the Dobbhoff feeding tube with placement of a
 nasogastric which is seen coursing in the upper esophagus and then the distal
 portion is seen with the tip likely within the stomach, although the mid
 portion of the tube is not well visualized on the current examination. 
 Therefore, followup imaging would be advised.  Left subclavian PICC line
 unchanged in position with its tip in the distal SVC.
 
 2.  Heart remains enlarged. Improving mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with
 likely layering effusions and associated patchy opacities which may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Status post median sternotomy.
