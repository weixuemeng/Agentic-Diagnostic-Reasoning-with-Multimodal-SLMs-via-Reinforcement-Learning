                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache and dizziness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly is mild, slightly improved since prior.  Pulmonary
 vascular markings are prominent compatible with congestion.  Small opacity at
 the lateral right lung base may represent atelectasis or consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.  A coil in the left axilla is
 new.  Multiple medical devices, including epicardial leads of anterior
 abdominal wall pacer, SVC stent, and right brachiocephalic stent are in
 similar position to prior.  Rugger ___ appearance of the lumbar vertebral
 bodies is similar to prior and compatible with hyperparathyroidism, which may
 be secondary to renal failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small opacity at the lateral right lung base, compatible with atelectasis
 or infection.
 2.  Stable pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild cardiomegaly, slightly
 improved since prior.
 3.  New coil in left axilla.  Please correlate with clinical history.
