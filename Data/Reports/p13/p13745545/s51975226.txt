                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old-man with left pleural effusion, now status post
 thoracocentesis, to rule out pneumothorax or residual effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Following thoracocentesis, previously moderate left pleural
 effusion has decreased.  Residual opacity in the left lower lung is mostly
 combination of residual small effusion and atelectasis and/or consolidation. 
 concurrent lung infection, however, cannot be ruled out.  Small right pleural
 effusion is unchanged since at least ___.  There are no other
 interval changes in the lungs.  Two leads from the left pectoral AICD device
 ends into the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. 
 Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart size is stable, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.
