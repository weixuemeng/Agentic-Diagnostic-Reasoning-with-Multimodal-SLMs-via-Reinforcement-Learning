                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with possible worsening pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette in the patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in
 place.  Some hyperexpansion of the lungs is again seen.  Diffuse prominence of
 interstitial markings is again consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
 and probable interstitial prominence related to chronic lung disease.
