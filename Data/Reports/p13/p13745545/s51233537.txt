                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, progressive dyspnea on exertion, and diastolic heart
 failure, right lower lobe opacity on chest CT, for assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ to ___.  Concurrently, chest CT from
 ___ was reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since ___, mild pulmonary interstitial edema has improved.  Small
 right pleural effusion and accompanying right lower lung opacity, mostly
 atelectasis is overall similar.  Moderate left pleural effusion appears
 minimally worse, while increased retrocardiac density and lower lung opacity,
 which is atelectasis and/or consolidation has improved.  No new discrete
 opacities.  Discrete, right lower lobe soft tissue density opacity,
 appreciated on chest CT dated ___ is beyond the resolution of chest
 radiograph.  Moderately enlarged heart size is unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Two leads from the left pectoral ICD device
 end in the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.
