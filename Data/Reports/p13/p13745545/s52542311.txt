                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since most recent prior radiographs, again seen are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Prominence of interstitial markings and hyperexpansion may
 be consistent with emphysema; however, mild pulmonary edema cannot be
 excluded.  Again seen is opacity overlying the left base as well as the left
 mid lung zone which is slightly more conspicuous on today's exam.  Known
 underlying left basilar nodular opacities are also partially visualized.  This
 may represent infection or aspiration.  Left chest wall pacemaker is seen with
 leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Possible mild pulmonary edema on background of emphysema.
 3.  Slight increase in left basilar opacity may indicate a superimposed
 infectious process.
