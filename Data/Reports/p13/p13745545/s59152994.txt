                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post history of COPD, DCHF and
 interstitial lung disease, status post recent biopsy of right lower lobe
 lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and a chest CT ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe, likely represents
 post-biopsy changes.  Known right lower lobe consolidation is not visualized
 in the current study.  Again seen is heterogeneous opacification of the
 retrocardiac left lower lobe, slightly improved since the prior study,
 suggestive of improving edema.  A stable small right pleural effusion and mild
 increase in a small left pleural effusion is noted.  No new consolidation or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Dense calcifications of the pericardium are noted. 
 Left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in the expected position of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving left lower lobe changes, likely represent improving edema.
 2.  Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe, likely represents post-biopsy
 changes.
 3.  Emphysema and bilateral small pleural effusions.
