 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain after thoracentesis, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left dual-lead pacer is unchanged in appearance.  Trace left
 greater than right pleural effusions are similar in appearance to the previous
 examination without evidence of pneumothorax.  Changes of emphysema are noted.
 The heart is moderately enlarged with pericardial calcifications again seen.
 Rounded opacity projecting over the cardiac apex is likely due to pericardial
 calcficiations though a loculation of fluid or rounded atelectasis could have
 a similar appearance. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace effusions without evidence of pneumothorax after
 thoracentesis.
