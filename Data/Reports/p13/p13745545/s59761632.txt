                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy, now increasing dyspnea, worsening
 pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  A pacemaker is present, with leads overlying
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is a
 small-to-moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 There is a small right effusion, likely with atelectasis and/or consolidation
 at the right base.  There is upper zone redistribution.  There are diffusely
 increased interstitial markings, more than on ___.  The left effusion and
 left base opacities are increased.  The right base opacities are not clearly
 changed.  Heart size is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased interstitial markings could reflect an element of CHF.  Other
 interstitial processes cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 2.  Interval increase in left pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 3.  Stable small right effusion with right basilar opacities.
