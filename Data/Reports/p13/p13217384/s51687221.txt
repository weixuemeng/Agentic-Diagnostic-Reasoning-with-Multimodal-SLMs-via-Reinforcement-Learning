                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with acute onset of nausea, vomiting and
 abdominal pain.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is slightly larger than prior exam.  Although still
 within normal limits and likely exaggerated due to the lower lung volumes, the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs volumes
 are low, exaggerating the bronchovascular structures, but there is no
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes but no acute cardiopulmonary process and no
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
