 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with anterior R ___ rib fx s/p polytrauma  //
 eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A band of opacification base of the left lung is is
 probably atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  No displaced rib fracture.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
