                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is mild interstitial edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains calcified and
 tortuous.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Dual-lead right-sided
 pacemaker is stable in position, with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The bones are relatively
 osteopenic.  Dense subcentimeter rounded opacities projecting over the right
 lung base most likely represent calcified granuloma again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation.
