                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with UTI, cord compression, w/ new cough, ? PNA
 // please eval ? PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead pacemaker is again noted, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  There is hyperinflation, consistent with background COPD.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 but no overt CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base.  No frank
 consolidation.  Possibility of tiny left and right effusions cannot be
 excluded.
 
 A rounded ___.2 mm calcification is noted overlying the superior mediastinum
 slightly to the right of midline -- ___ CT shows this to represent a
 calcified nodule in the inferior right thyroid lobe.
 
 Incidental note is made of coarse calcifications in the right breast
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. COPD and mild cardiomegaly.
 2. Upper zone redistribution and probable trace bilateral effusions, without
 other evidence of CHF.
 3. Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  No focal infiltrate or consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.  If clinical suspicion for pneumonic infiltrate remains
 high, then further assessment with repeat radiograph including lateral view
 could help to assess for developing pneumonic infiltrate.
 4. Small calcified thyroid nodule again noted.
