 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Relative lucency within the
 lung apices is reflective of paraseptal emphysema, better delineated on the
 prior CT.  Minimal streaky opacities are noted in the lung bases likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases but no evidence for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
