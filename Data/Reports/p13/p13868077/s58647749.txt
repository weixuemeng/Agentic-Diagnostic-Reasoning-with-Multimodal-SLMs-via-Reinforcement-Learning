                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Tachypnea in a patient with altered mental syndrome.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are essentially clear. 
 No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, not definitely seen on the prior
 study, but since no pleural effusion is seen on the lateral view it most
 likely represents focal area of pleural thickening.
