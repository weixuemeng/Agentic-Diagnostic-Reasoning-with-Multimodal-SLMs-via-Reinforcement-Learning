                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:51 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with septic shock and fluid resuscitation, now
 acutely dyspneic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 4:54 p.m.:
 
 Increased pulmonary vascular congestion and new septal lines in the right
 lower lobe indicate new pulmonary edema, and suggested increasing
 opacification at the right lung base is dependent edema rather than aspiration
 or pneumonia, although either could be present.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Small pleural
 effusions are presumed.
