                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is more prominent and there are diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  Mild
 atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
 
 The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 7.4 cm above the carina.  Right
 central catheter tip extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
