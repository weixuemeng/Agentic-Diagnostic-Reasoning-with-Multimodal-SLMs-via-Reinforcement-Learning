                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF  // Eval for pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Allowing for differences in technique and inspiration, mild cardiomegaly is
 grossly stable.  Moderate central vascular congestion and interstitial
 pulmonary edema is noted.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis is noted, and there
 is a probable left pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged from the prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly and moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion and
 interstitial edema.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and likely pleural effusion, with superimposed
 infection remaining difficult to exclude.
