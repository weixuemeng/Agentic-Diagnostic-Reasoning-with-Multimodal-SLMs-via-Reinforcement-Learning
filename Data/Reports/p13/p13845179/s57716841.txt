 Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is stable in appearance.  Lungs are slightly
 hyperinflated. There are bibasal opacities better appreciated on the lateral
 view, partially seen on CT abdomen, concerning for infectious process.
 Followup of the patient 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy is
