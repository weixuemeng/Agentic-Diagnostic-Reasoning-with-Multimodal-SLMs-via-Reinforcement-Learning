                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumothorax  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 12:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright and lateral views of the chest ___ at 08:10
 are submitted. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left basilar pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. However, on the
 current study, there is a small apical and medial hydropneumothorax best
 visualized on the lateral projection which is substantially smaller than that
 seen on ___.  The lungs remain hyperinflated with stable
 parenchymal distortion and scarring consistent with underlying severe
 emphysema as evident on chest CT dated ___. A tiny left pleural effusion is
 stable. More focal patchy opacity in the left mid lung is unchanged but may
 reflect scarring related to underlying emphysema or superimposed infection.
 Clinical correlation is recommended.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
