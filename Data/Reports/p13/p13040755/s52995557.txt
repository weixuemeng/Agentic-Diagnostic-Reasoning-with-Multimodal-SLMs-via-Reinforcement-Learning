                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent pneumonia. Have infiltrates
 resolved?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left hydro-pneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung.
 Further collapse or re-expansion of the left lung is prevented by chronic lung
 disease. Notably, in the mid-upper right lung, there is a dense, wedge-shaped
 opacity extending to the pleura, concerning for a pulmonary infarct. No right
 pneumothorax is present. The thoracic aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Multiple calcifications of the costal cartilage, particularly on the left, is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Significant left hydro-pneumothorax with partial collapse of the left
 lung, without mediastinal shift.  Chronic lung disease is likely preventing
 re-expansion of the lung. Left-sided chest tube placement is recommended.
 
 2. Wedge-shaped opacity extending to the pleura in the right upper/mid lung,
 concerning for pulmonary infarction.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 17:34 on ___, ___ min after
 discovery.  Dr. ___ will contact the patient and discuss with the patient's
 pulmonologist and ordering clinician, Dr. ___.
