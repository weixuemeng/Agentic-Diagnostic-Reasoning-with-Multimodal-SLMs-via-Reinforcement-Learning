                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with L pneumo, s/p CT placement  // Please eval chest tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from earlier the same day and chest x-ray from ___ PA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube.  Small
 residual pneumothorax seen surrounding the left lung apex. There has been
 interval re-expansion of the left lower lobe with some parenchymal opacity,
 potentially residual atelectasis although given older prior, improving
 infection is also possible. Wedge-shaped right upper lung opacity laterally is
 unchanged and as previously detailed potentially representing an infarct.
 Small right pleural effusion is visualized. Chronic underlying changes of the
 lungs appears similar compatible with patient's underlying emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a left basilar chest tube with decrease in size of the
 left-sided pneumothorax which persists surrounding the left lung apex.
 Other changes as above notable for re-expansion of left lower lobe with some
 persistent opacity for which followup to resolution is necessary. Wedge shaped
 right upper lung opacity for which CTA is again recommended.
