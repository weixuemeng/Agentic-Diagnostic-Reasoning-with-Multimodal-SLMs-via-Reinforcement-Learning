                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with status epilecticus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina.  A catheter
 courses along the left aspect of the chest, presumably a VP shunt catheter. 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Low
 lung volumes are present. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax
 or pulmonary vascular congestion is identified. No acute osseous abnormality
 is detected. Multiple radiopaque punctate foreign bodies are seen projecting
 over the right hemithorax and right shoulder, presumably shrapnel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural
 effusion.
