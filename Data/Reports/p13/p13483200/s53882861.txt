                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated patient with hypoxia, evaluate for cause of hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day at 20:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. There has
 been interval placement of an enteric tube although the tip courses out of the
 field of view of this exam. A catheter is again seen projecting over the
 mediastinum, presumably a VP shunt.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged since the prior study, as is a small left
 pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle was not included on this exam.
 Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Metallic objects projecting over the
 right shoulder, presumably shrapnel, are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Appropriate position of the ET tube which terminates 3 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion.  A
 component of aspiration is also possible.
