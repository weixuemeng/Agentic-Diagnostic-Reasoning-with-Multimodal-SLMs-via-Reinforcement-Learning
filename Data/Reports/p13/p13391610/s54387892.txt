                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ swelling  // ?vascular congestion,
 cardiomegaly
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear. 
 Mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm is probably related to adjacent
 distension of the stomach and splenic flexure.  Lucency below the left
 hemidiaphragm is likely related to air within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
 
 2.  Lucency below left hemidiaphragm is likely due to air within a distended
 stomach.  If there is clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air,
 standard lateral chest radiograph or left lateral decubitus abdominal view
 would be recommended.
