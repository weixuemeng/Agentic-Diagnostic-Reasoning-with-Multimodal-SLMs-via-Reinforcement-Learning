                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion
 with swollen ankles.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  There are bibasilar
 opacities which silhouette the hemidiaphragms, right greater than left
 suggestive of pleural effusions.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vascular
 markings with cephalization also seen.  Cardiac silhouette appears slightly
 enlarged but is difficult to assess given bibasilar opacities.  Degenerative
 changes noted at the shoulders bilaterally.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures otherwise grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities suggestive of pleural effusions and findings
 compatible with pulmonary edema.
