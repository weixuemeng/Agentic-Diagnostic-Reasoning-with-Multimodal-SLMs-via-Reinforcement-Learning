 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and cecal

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal. A linear right lower lung density
 appears stable compared to the prior exam, likely secondary to scarring. There
 is bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no focal area of consolidation. There has
 been a slight interval increase in vascular engorgement, without evidence of
 frank interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The
 heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No acute abnormalities identified to explain patient's fevers. Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
