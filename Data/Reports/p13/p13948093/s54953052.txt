                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, desaturation.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a
 triple-lumen internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the right
 atrium.  Obliquity of the patient, slightly lower lung volumes resulting in
 vascular crowding, and vascular engorgement result in retrocardiac and right
 lower lung opacities.  In the right clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Obliquity of the patient, lower lung volumes, and vascular
 engorgement result in retrocardiac and right lower lung opacities.  In the
 right clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
