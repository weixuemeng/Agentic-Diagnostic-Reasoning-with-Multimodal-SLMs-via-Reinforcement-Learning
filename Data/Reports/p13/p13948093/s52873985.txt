                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening hypoxia, fever, and tachycardia.
 // Compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation. Pre-existing signs of fluid overload
 are minimally less severe than on the previous image. The multifocal
 parenchymal opacities, notably at the lateral bases of the right upper lobe,
 in the right lower lobe and in the perihilar left-sided areas are unchanged.
 Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
