                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cord with persistent fevers, no altered s/p
 bronch.  // rule out pneumothorax, new pulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:
 ___ and chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and apparent pattern of asymmetrical
 pulmonary edema in the right juxta hilar region. Alternatively, pneumonia
 coexisting with edema is possible. Worsened left retrocardiac opacity may
 reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or consolidation. Small left and moderate
 right pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
