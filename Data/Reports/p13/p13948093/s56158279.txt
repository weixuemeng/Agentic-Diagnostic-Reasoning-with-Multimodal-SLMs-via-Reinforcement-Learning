 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have substantially
 decreased. There is a new left-sided pleural effusion, combined to a basal and

 coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The right central venous
 access line is in correct position.
