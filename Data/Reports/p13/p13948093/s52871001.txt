                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Previously present left
 lower lobe consolidation has resolved, but there is some residual bronchial
 wall thickening in this region, best visualized on the lateral view.  Linearly
 oriented opacities in the lingula appear to correspond to post-radiation
 scarring based on correlative CT of ___.  Lungs are otherwise clear.
 Asymmetrical biapical thickening appears similar.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of left lower lobe pneumonia with residual left lower
 lobe bronchial wall thickening.
