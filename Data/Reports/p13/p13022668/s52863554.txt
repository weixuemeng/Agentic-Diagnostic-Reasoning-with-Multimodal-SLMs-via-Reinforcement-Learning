                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis and presenting with
 hypoxia.  Evaluate pneumonia fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  The lung
 volumes are slightly lower, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Additionally, this provides explanation for the apparent
 enlargement of the heart size and tracheal deviation.  There is no evidence
 for pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 airspace consolidation.  A linear area of scarring is again seen in the
 lateral left lung.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
