                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ill-defined history of benign pleural mass excision now with cough
 and scant hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Linear opacities are noted within the medial aspect of the right upper lobe
 and right mid lung field likely related to the patient's history of prior
 pleural mass excision. Linear opacity in the left lung base with tenting of
 the diaphragm is compatible with atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, mass lesion, or pneumothorax is present.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postoperative scarring within the right lung and left basilar atelectasis.
