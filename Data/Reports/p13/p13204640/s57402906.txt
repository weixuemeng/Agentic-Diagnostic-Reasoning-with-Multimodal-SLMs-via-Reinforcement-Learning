                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left temporal and throughout parenchymal hemorrhage status post
 nasogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric cardia where makes a loop in may
 terminate in retrograde fashion at the gastroesophageal junction so advancing
 the tube somewhat may be helpful. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear stable. Streaky opacities at the left lung base have decreased and
 suggest minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs remain clear. There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube passing into the gastric cardia but advancing the tube
 somewhat further into the stomach is recommended for more optimal positioning.
