                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates obscuration of the right
 heart border by a patchy opacity. The left pulmonary artery appears prominent,
 the right hila unremarkable.  The aorta appears tortuous or alternatively
 dilated. Interstitial markings are identified at the left lung base suggestive
 of pulmonary edema. Biapical scarring appear symmetric. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Patchy opacity obscuring the right heart border may reflect aspiration or
 alternatively early pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Prominent left pulmonary artery and interstitial interstitial markings at
 the left base suggests vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
