                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough post op  // eval chf vs pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lung volumes are slightly low. 
 There is a trace right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion. 
 There is a small opacity at the base of the left lung which may represent
 compressive atelectasis.  Slightly increased opacity involving the right lower
 lobe is improved from the prior examination on ___. No pneumothorax
 is detected.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to previous postoperative radiograph of ___, bilateral
 pleural effusions have decreased in size and a right PICC basilar focus of
 atelectasis has essentially resolved.  Left lower lobe opacity has decreased
 in extent and may reflect slowly resolving atelectasis or potentially a focus
 of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
