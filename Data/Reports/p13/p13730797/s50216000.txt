                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // predischarge eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Status post sternotomy.  Mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged and compatible with recent surgery.  There is continued s patchy
 retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, with slight elevation left hemidiaphragm and a small left
 effusion, all similar to the prior film.  There is focal opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region, likely in the right lower lobe posteriorly.  No gross
 right effusion.  No CHF.  There is thin linear density at the extreme upper
 left lung apex, though it does not follow the usual curvilinear course the
 lung this typically seen with a small pneumothorax .
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion is
 unchanged.
 2. Focal opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, likely in the right lower
 lobe is more pronounced on the current examination.  While this may represent
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis
 could include a focal infiltrate.
 3. Density at left lung apex, equivocal for tiny pneumothorax.  Clinical
 correlation is requested.  If clinically indicated, a repeat frontal view of
 the chest, taken at end-expiration of the respiratory cycle may help for
 further assessment.
