                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ and
 ___.
 
 The current radiograph demonstrates left subclavian line tip being at the
 level of mid SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Left lower lung
 consolidation is seen, overall minimally improved as compared to recent
 examinations.  There is no interval progression of consolidations elsewhere
 but right basal opacity is re-demonstrated, and might potentially represent
 additional area of infection as well.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
