                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the
 thoracic inlet.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip terminating to the right of the spine at the expected position of the
 pylorus.  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases on the left greater
 than the right are compatible with minimal atelectasis.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube and NG tube in appropriate position.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
