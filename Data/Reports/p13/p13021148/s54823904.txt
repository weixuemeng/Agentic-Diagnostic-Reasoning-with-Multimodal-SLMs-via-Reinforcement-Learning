 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, fever  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Mild cardiomegaly is noted. Coarsened
 lung markings may reflect interstitial lung disease. No large effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. No convincing signs of pneumonia. Patient rotation
 limits assessment. Allowing for this, the mediastinal contour is likely within
 normal limits. The bony structures are demineralized though appear intact.
