                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p TAVR  // interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation suggesting background COPD.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, with mediastinal widening, are similar to the prior film.  Again
 noted is radiodensity consistent with trans aortic valve replacement (TAVR). 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which is similar, possibly very
 slightly improved.   This is probably superimposed on background parenchymal
 scarring.  Blunting of right-greater-than-left costophrenic angles is
 consistent with a small amount of pleural fluid or thickening.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is again noted.  Atelectasis at the right base is slightly more
 pronounced and atelectasis at the left base is slightly improved.  No frank
 consolidation is identified.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal , if any, interval change compared with ___ at 07:57,
 detailed above.
