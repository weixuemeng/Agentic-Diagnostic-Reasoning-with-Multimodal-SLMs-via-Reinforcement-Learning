                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ and ___, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Diffuse
 micronodularity is consistent with patient's known LCH. However, since
 ___, the interstitial abnormality has increased with new right basilar
 opacity and perihilar fullness. The heart appears slightly larger. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are similar. The findings suggest mild heart
 failure superimposed on patient's known chronic lung disease/LCH. No
 pneumothorax. Mediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: The findings suggest mild cardiac decompensation superimposed on
 patient's known LCH.  Supervening infection, particularly at the right lung
 base cannot be excluded.  Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment.
