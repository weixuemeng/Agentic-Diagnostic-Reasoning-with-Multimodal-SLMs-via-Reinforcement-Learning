                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  Now presenting with a
 CHF exacerbation.  Evaluate for interval improvement in volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an interval decrease in the degree of mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, with the remaining diffuse interstitial
 abnormality thought to be secondary to changes related to known Langerhans
 cell histiocytosis as opposed to persistent pulmonary edema.  At the right
 medial lung base, there is a less conspicuous heterogeneous opacity which
 could reflect an infectious process.  A similar opacity in the left mid to
 lower lung is also less apparent on today's today.  Left retrocardiac
 atelectasis is increased.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
 not significantly changed.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval near complete resolution of pulmonary edema with residual chronic
 interstitial abnormality thought to be secondary to known Langerhans cell
 lymphohistiocytosis.
 
 2.  Decreased right medial lung base and left mid-to-lower lung heterogeneous
 opacities, possibly infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 3.  Increased left retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 4.  Unchanged small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
