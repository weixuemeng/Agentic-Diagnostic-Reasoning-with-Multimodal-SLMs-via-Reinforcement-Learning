                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Langerhans cell histiocytosis, ongoing cough, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared
 zone of increased parenchymal opacity in the right mid lung.  The opacity,
 however, is more likely to reflect progression of the known underlying disease
 than pneumonia.  The retrocardiac lung volumes are better ventilated than on
 the previous image.  The right basal atelectasis that pre-existed has
 completely resolved.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  In the apical
 lung areas, there is unchanged extent of the pre-existing pulmonary changes.
