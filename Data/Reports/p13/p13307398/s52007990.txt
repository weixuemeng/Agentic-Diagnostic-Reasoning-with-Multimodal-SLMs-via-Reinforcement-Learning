                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a recent chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CTA chest
 from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of Langerhans cell
 histiocytosis with chronic lung disease, now with hypoglycemia.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The overall
 appearance of the chest is unchanged with reticular nodular diffuse opacity,
 better characterized on the prior CT keeping with patient's Langerhans cell
 histiocytosis.  General hilar prominence is stable compatible with known
 lymphadenopathy.  No definite acute superimposed process.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is stable.  Bony structures intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable reticular nodular pattern compatible with Langerhans cell
 histiocytosis with prominence of the hila, also unchanged, compatible with
 known lymphadenopathy.  No superimposed acute process.
