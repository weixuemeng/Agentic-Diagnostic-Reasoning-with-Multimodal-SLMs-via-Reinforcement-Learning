                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male status post fall, question rib
 fracture. Further review of the medical record reveals Langerhans cell
 histiocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate nodular
 interstitial abnormality which is increased since ___.  The heart size is
 normal, there is no pleural effusion.  There is biapical pleural thickening,
 and there is enlargement of the pulmonary hila. A ring opacity adjacent to the
 right hilum might represent a new nodule vs. a confluence of opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased nodular interstitial abnormality, compatible with the reported
 history of Langerhans cell histiocytosis; sarcoid or disseminated malignancy
 might also have this appearance and account for progressive nodulation.
 
 2.  Opacity adjacent to right hilum, which should be further evaluated with
 dedicated chest CT on a non-emergent basis.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:15AM by phone.
