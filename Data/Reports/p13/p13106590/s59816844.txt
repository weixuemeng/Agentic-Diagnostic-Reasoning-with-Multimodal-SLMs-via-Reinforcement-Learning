                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of trauma, may not get out of bed due
 to thoracic spine fracture.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are unchanged low lung volumes.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has
 increased.  Left lower lobe, retrocardiac opacity is stable.  This could be
 due to atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  If any,
 there is a small left pleural effusion.  There is no evident pneumothorax. 
 Previously visualized tiny right pneumothorax on prior CT is not visualized in
 this examination.
