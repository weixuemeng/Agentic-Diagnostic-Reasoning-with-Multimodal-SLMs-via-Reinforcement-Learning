                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures, particularly at the lung bases. With this
 limitation in mind, note is made of apparent bibasilar retrocardiac opacities.
 There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Note is
 made of splenic prominence in the upper abdomen, corresponding to splenomegaly
 reported on recent ultrasound of the same date.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities, which could be due to atelectasis,
 aspiration, and/or infectious pneumonia. Repeat radiograph with improved
 inspiratory level would allow more complete assessment of this region.
