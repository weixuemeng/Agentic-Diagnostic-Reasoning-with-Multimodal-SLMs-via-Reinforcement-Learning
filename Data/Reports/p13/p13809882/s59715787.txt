                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with renal failure, new cough, lll crackles  //
 r/p pna, pul edema      r/p pna, pul edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusion is substantially increased. Opacification
 in the left lower lung could be atelectasis alone, but pneumonia would not be
 recognizable and the right infrahilar region is particularly concerning for
 possible pneumonia. Upper lungs show vascular congestion but no edema. Heart
 is obscured by pleural effusion and therefore the extent of any cardiomegaly
 is indeterminate.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses from the left pectoral generator. There is no pneumothorax.
