                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recently detected nodule, bilateral
 effusions  // Have effusions decreased in size? Recently diuresed      Have
 effusions decreased in size? Recently diuresed
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no comparison studies since ___. Cardiac silhouette is at
 the upper limits of normal in size and there is again tortuosity of the
 descending thoracic aorta. Dual-channel pacer is in place with the leads in
 unchanged position. Opacification at the bases is consistent with small
 effusions and basilar atelectasis.
 A definite nodule it is not appreciated on this study, though there are some
 round opacifications (possibly vessels on end) anteriorly on the lateral view.
 A would be essential to compare the current study with an EXAMINATION on which
 the nodule was detected.
