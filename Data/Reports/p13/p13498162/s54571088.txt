  1. Evaluation for free air is severely limited due to supine positioning.
  However, there is a vague lucency overlying the left upper quadrant which is
  suspicious for free air, continued followup is recommended.
  2. Vague lucencies around the upper esophagus are also suspicious for a
  possible pneumomediastium. Continued followup recommended.
  3. Right IJ with tip in the right ventricle. Retraction by 3 cm recommended.
  4. ET tube tip is not clearly visualized but appears nears the trachea.
  Retraction by 2cm recommended to ensure proper positioning.
  5. Dilated esophagus and stomach with ___ tube in place.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST AT 6:59 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A variceal bleed.  Attempted gastric banding. Painful, rigid
 abdomen.  Rule out free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 4:22 p.m.:
 
 A Minnesota or Sengstaken enteric tube traverses the esophagus and upper
 stomach, with esophageal balloon fully distended and the fundic balloon
 partially distended to a diameter of 6 cm.
 
 There is no large pneumoperitoneum.  Small left pleural effusion has
 increased.  Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate to severe, but little changed. 
 Upper lungs are clear.  The heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes,
 probably normal.  Tip of the endotracheal tube is partially obscured by the
 enteric tube, probably in standard position.  No pneumothorax.
