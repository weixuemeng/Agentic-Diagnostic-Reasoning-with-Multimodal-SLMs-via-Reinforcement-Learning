                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of metastatic carcinoid syndrome, complaining of
 increased fatigue, edema, ascites, shortness of breath, palpitations and
 decreased cognition.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation with CT torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Lung volumes are low due to elevation of both
 hemidiaphragms, left greater than right, resulting in more left basal
 atelectasis than before. The aerated upper lungs are clear.  A small left
 pleural effusion is larger, probably secondary to ascites.  Gastric distension
 with air and fluid is considerable, and the splenic flexure is also very
 distended, but the chronicity of these findings is uncertain.
