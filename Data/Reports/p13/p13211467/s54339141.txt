                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low.  Mild pulmonary
 edema does remain along with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Near
 atelectasis at the right lung base is also noted.  Cardiomegaly is mild and
 unchanged.  Bones are grossly intact.  Aorta is calcified, and chronic height
 loss in multiple vertebral bodies is seen.  A slight leftward deviation of the
 trachea could be due to a thyroid goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No overall change from the prior study with mild pulmonary edema
 and bilateral pleural effusions.
