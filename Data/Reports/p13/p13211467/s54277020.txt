                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, recently intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___ hours.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable frontral chest radiograph. An endotracheal tube has been
 placed in the interim, the tip is positioned 4 cm from the level of the
 carina.  An NG tube has been placed, the tip is within the stomach.  Lung
 volumes are improved, with note of linear atelectasis in the right mid lung. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema, though venous engorgment has improved likely
 from positive pressure ventilation.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 and mediastinal contours demonstrate decreased azygous engorgment.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation, with appropriate position of the ET tube and
 improvement in lung volumes.
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema though venous engorgment has decreased.
