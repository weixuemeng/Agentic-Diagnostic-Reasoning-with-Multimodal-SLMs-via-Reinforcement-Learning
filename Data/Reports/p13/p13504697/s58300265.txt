                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with AML, admitted with blast crisis, now with
 fever/low grade temperature. Please evaluate for cause of fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged even accounting for AP
 technique. There is a focal area of increased opacity at the right lung base,
 which could reflect atelectasis or overlying vessels; however, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, this could also represent early developing
 pneumonia. There is evidence of increased venous pressure. Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle could be related to a small amount of pleural fluid.
 No definite pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased focal opacity at the right lung base, which could
 reflect atelectasis or overlying vessels. However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, developing pneumonia should also be considered.
