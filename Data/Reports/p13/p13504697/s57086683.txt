                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:17 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after a respiratory arrest.  Check ET tube
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 11:41 p.m.  ET
 tube in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube passes to the distal
 portion of a non-distended stomach.  Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  Upper
 mediastinal distention is probably a function of vascular engorgement in the
 supine position.  I see no explanation for respiratory insufficiency.  This
 examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary
 embolism.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.
