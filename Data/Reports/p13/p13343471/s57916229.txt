                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single portable semi-erect AP view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Severe epigastric pain, evaluate for free air in the
 diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was obtained. 
 There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis,
 lucency underlying the right hemidiaphragm could be within bowel; however,
 there is concern for free air.  There is also evidence of partially-imaged
 dilated small bowel projecting over the right abdomen.  There are areas of
 atelectasis/scarring in the left mid-to-lower lung.  No large pleural effusion
 is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The mediastinum is shifted to
 the left, likely due to the elevated right hemidiaphragm and the cardiac
 silhouette may be enlarged, although the right aspect of the cardiac
 silhouette is not well assessed due to the elevated right hemidiaphragm.  The
 aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis, lucency
 underlying the right hemidiaphragm could be within bowel; however, there is
 concern for free air. Possible pneumoperitoneum under the right hemidiaphragm.
 This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 5:35
 p.m., 15 minutes after discovery/page.
 
 2.  Partially-imaged dilated small bowel in the right abdomen, underlying
 obstruction may be present.
