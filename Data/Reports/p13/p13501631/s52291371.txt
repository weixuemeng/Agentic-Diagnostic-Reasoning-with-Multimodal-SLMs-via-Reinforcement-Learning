                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib and clavicular fracture.  New O2 requirement, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 10:57 a.m.  Targeted review of a
 chest CT from ___ from ___, ___.  No formal report is available
 for review.  However, note is made of multiple fractures along the right
 posterior ribs.  
 
 FINDINGS:  On the current examination, inspiratory volumes are quite low. 
 Allowing for this, no obvious change is detected compared with ___. 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  There is increased opacity along the right mediastinal
 silhouette, not fully evaluated on the AP view, but grossly unchanged.  There
 is prominent atelectasis in both lungs.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is probably also unchanged.  Focal opacity seen
 posteriorly, some more pronounced than on the prior study, question focal area
 of atelectasis.  No obvious pneumothorax is identified and no gross effusion
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Compared to ___, no definite change.  Focal hazy opacity posteriorly
 is of uncertain etiology, question new area of atelectasis.  The differential
 diagnosis could include new interval presentation of a diaphragmatic hernia.  
 2.  Known rib fracture is not well depicted radiographically.  
 3.  The patient's right clavicular fracture is noted.
