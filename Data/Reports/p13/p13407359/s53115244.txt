                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Right lower lobe opacities have increased, could
 be due to increasing atelectasis or aspiration.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac
 opacities are unchanged, could be also to atelectasis or aspiration.  Mild
 basilar congestion is new.
