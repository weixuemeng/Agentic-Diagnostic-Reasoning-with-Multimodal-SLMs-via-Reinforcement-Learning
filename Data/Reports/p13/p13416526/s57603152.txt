                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Asses for intrapulmonary process after fall and possible rib
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent prior chest radiograph was ___.  Chest CT
 was performed on ___ at 11:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is miniscule and there is no appreciable left pleural
 effusion.  Heart is top-normal size.  Pulmonary vasculature unremarkable. 
 Chest CT demonstrates rib fractures to better advantage, but there has been no
 interval increase in displacements.
 
 Incidental note is made on reviewing the chest CT of sufficient aortic
 valvular calcification to be hemodynamically significant.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical evaluation for any evidence of aortic stenosis.
