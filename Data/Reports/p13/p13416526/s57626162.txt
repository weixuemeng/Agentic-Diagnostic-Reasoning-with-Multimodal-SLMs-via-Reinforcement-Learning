 right sided pleural effusion has almost completely resolved in the interval.
 There is no left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax bilaterally.  A
 left-sided PICC line has been withdrawn in the interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete resolution of right sided pleural effusion. No
 significant change in right sided pleural scarring/thickening with associated
 minimal right middle lobe atelectasis. No evidence of nodules or masses to
 suggest metastatic process.
