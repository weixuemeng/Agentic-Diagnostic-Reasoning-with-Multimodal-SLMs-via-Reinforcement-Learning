                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and weight gain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 chest is difficult to evaluate due to soft tissue attenuation, but there is no
 definite parenchymal abnormality.  Although there is increased attenuation
 vaguely projecting over the mid-to-lower spine on the lateral view, this is
 felt most likely to be an artifact.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Limited examination, but no definite evidence of acute disease.
