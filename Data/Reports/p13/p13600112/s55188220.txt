                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pulmonary edema has
 decreased in extent and severity.  There is no evidence of pneumonia but the
 relatively extensive left retrocardiac atelectasis.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  A rounded density at the left lung bases new and likely caused by
 overlaying soft tissues.
