                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia on ventilator, here to evaluate for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___ at ___
 p.m. and 07:48 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An improved position of the endotracheal tube, with the tip now
 terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina.  There is persistent
 opacification at the left lung base, since the earlier study on ___,
 likely reflecting a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is a
 recurrent opacity at the right lung base, which is also most compatible with
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  There is
 increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar
 opacification.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged.  There is mild calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved ET tube position, terminating 5 cm above the carina.
 2.  Persistent left pleural effusion and atelectasis and probable right
 basilar atelectasis.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema is mildly increased.
