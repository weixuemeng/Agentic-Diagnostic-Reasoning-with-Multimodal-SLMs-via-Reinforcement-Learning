 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:08 PM
  Since the prior study, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal
  tube, which terminates in the right mainstem bronchus, and should be retracted
  5-6 cm.  There is associated left lower lobe collapse.  The above findings
  were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 23:05, ___ min after
  discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ERCP, here to evaluate for new pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 07:48 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated and the tip of the ET tube
 terminates in the right main stem bronchus and should be retracted
 approximately 5 cm for appropriate positioning.  There is interval
 opacification of the left lung base compatible with atelectasis.  A small left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  The right lung is relatively clear with
 interval improved opacity at the right lung base from the most recent prior
 study.  No pneumothorax is detected.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion/interstitial edema, which is unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar opacification. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and partial calcification of the aortic knob.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right mainstem intubation.  The ET tube should be retracted approximately
 5 cm.
 2.  Interval left basilar collapse. Small left pleural effusion is likely
 present.
 3.  Persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 23:05 p.m., five minutes after discovery.
