                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single AP radiograph was reviewed.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding.  A right basilar opacity
 partly silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm is noted. Left basilar atelectasis
 is also present. A high riding right humeral head with a top normal
 acromio-clavicular interval is noted, which may reflect a prior injury. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes with left basilar atelectasis and right basilar opacity
 concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
 2. High riding right humeral head and top normal acromio-clavicular interval,
 which may reflect prior injury. Clinical correlation is recommended.
