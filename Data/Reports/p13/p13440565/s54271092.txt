                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema and/or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 21:06.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Again demonstrated are bilateral
 pleural effusions, which are unchanged on the left and slightly improved on
 the right.  This may be due to patient positioning.  The upper lobes are clear
 appearing.  There is no change in the right-sided PICC line.  Again seen is a
 right basilar atelectasis which is unchanged.  No new consolidation or
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal improvement in the right-sided pleural effusion with stable appearance
 of left pleural effusion.  These changes may be due to patient positioning.
