                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size and
 there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal
 pneumonia.  Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Apical pleural thickening is seen bilaterally.  A metallic BB is projected
 over the lower left breast.  Dense calcification is seen in a nondilated
 descending thoracic aorta.
