                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is moderately enlarged and increased when compared to the
 prior exam.  Aortic knob is calcified.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are new compared to prior study.  A pleural-based
 rounded opacity within the right lateral aspect of the inferior right
 hemithorax likely reflects a pseudotumor with fluid tracking within the major
 fissure.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is diffuse vascular
 calcification of the thoracoabdominal aorta.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild congestive heart failure.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Nodular pleural-based rounded opacity
 within the right lateral inferior hemithorax likely reflects fluid tracking
 within the major fissure.  Followup radiographs after diuresis are
 recommended, and if this finding continues, then a CT of the chest is
 suggested for further evaluation.
