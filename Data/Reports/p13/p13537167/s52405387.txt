                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.  History of recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___; ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS  There is a single-lead pacemaker device with a lead terminating in
 the right ventricle.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Trace posterior bilateral
 pleural effusions are suspected due to blunting of posterior costophrenic
 sulci.  In the right perihilar region, there is a vague opacity suggesting
 pneumonia in the right lower lobe.  Vague opacity in the left mid lung is not
 necessarily changed since remote prior radiographs, however, and may be
 associated with slight scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the right lower lobe suggesting pneumonia,
 likely unchanged since recent prior radiographs.
