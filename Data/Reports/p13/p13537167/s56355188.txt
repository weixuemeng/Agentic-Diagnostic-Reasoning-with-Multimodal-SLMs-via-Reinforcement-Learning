 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the aortic balloon pump has been
 removed. A Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed via the left internal jugular
 vein access. The tip of the catheter is in the right pulmonary artery, the
 catheter should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm.  The venous introduction
 sheet on the right has been removed.  The other monitoring and support devices
 are constant.  Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma.  . Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.
 In unchanged manner, there is an unusually sharp delineation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, which could be interpreted as an indirect sign for the presence
 of free pleural air on the right.  No apical pneumothorax is visualized.
