                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right internal jugular central line placement, here to evaluate
 right IJ line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed one hour earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular
 central venous line with the tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC.  An
 endotracheal tube terminating below the thoracic inlet 2.9 cm above the
 carina.  There has been interval removal of a transcutaneous pacemaker from
 the most recent prior study.  A left pectoral pacemaker with a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricular apex is stable.  Calcification at the
 cardiac apex is also unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but
 stable.  The lungs are clear without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is essentially
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right IJ central venous catheter with tip in the mid-to-lower SVC without
 pneumothorax..
