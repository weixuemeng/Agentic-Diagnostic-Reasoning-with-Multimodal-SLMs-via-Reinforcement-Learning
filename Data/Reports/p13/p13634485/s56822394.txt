                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with aspiration event, assess for progression.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest was obtained.  Tracheostomy tube
 is noted.  The patient is rotated.  Left basal opacity is seen, which could
 reflect an early aspiration event.  No priors are available for comparison. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
