 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 4:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 The feeding tube continues to have its tip projecting over the stomach.  The
 left internal jugular central line continues to terminate in the proximal SVC.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities at both bases most
 likely reflect atelectasis, although a bibasilar pneumonia could not be
 entirely excluded.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.
