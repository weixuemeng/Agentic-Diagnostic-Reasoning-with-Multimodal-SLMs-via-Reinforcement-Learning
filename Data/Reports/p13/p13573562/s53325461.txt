                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with increasing altered mental status, evaluate
 for infiltrate and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is a
 retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base which is nonspecific and may
 represent atelectasis versus infectious process.  There are no other focal
 consolidations seen.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a left ventricular
 configuration.  Median sternotomy wires are seen.  There is no evidence of
 CHF.  There are multiple old healed rib fractures on the right as well as old
 fracture of the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base which is nonspecific and may be
 atelectasis; however, cannot rule out infectious process.
