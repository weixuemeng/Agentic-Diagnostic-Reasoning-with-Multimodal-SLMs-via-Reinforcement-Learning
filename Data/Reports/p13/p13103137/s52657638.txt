                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  A nodular opacity is seen
 overlying the right mid lung.  A well-marginated elongated opacity is seen
 overlying the left mid lung laterally. These findings are seen only on the
 frontal view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Opacities in the lungs as described above, potentially
 representing calcified pleural plaques. However, given lack of prior imaging
 to ensure stability, and given the relatively nodular appearance of the right
 lung opacity, CT is recommended on a nonemergent basis to further assess.
