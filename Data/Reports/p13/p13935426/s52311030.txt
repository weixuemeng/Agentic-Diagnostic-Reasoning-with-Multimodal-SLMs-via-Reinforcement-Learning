                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, sinus congestion, myalgias, and diarrhea, likely viral
 illness, but presented with dehydration.  Rule out bacterial process.  Please
 evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to most recent radiograph, there is suboptimal
 inspiration, which contributes to low lung volumes, increased vascular
 crowding in the bases, and increased silhouetting of the heart and
 mediastinum.  Allowing for this, there is no substantial change in the
 increased interstitial markings which persist suggesting possible viral
 pneumonia or chronic interstitial lung disease.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistence of increased interstitial markings may be due to an
 infectious etiology, likely viral, or chronic interstitial lung disease.  
 Follow-up in ___ weeks for documentation of resolution is reccomended
