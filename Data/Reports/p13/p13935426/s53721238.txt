                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, headache.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 diffuse increased interstitial marking suggesting mild interstitial edema,
 atypical pneumonia not excluded.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse increased interstitial markings may be due to
 interstitial edema versus atypical infection, depending on the clinical
 scenario.
