                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively
 low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and some elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  More coalescent opacification with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm is seen in the left mid and lower zones. 
 Although this could reflect a central edema and volume loss in the lower lobe,
 in view of the clinical history, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 should be seriously considered.  
 
 Dialysis catheter remains in place.
