                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Single upright view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  Streaky bibasilar opacities are
 seen, which may be due to atelectasis, although infection or aspiration is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Right mid lung
 atelectasis/scarring is seen.  Blunting of the bilateral posterior
 costophrenic angles is seen, which could be due to trace bilateral effusions. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
