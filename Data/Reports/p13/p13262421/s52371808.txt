 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chronic kidney disease, septic shock, question acute
 cardiorespiratory process.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 Compared to the study from earlier the same day, there continues to be
 moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular re-distribution and a right
 lower lobe infiltrate.  There is volume loss/infiltrate in the left lower
 lung.  While much of the findings can be due to pulmonary edema, the dense
 consolidation in the right lower lung is concerning for infection.
