                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath.  Study
 requested for evaluation of an acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinum appears
 enlarged with an increased lucency which may be reflective of a fat pad.
 Today's examination is however, more lordotic. Findings are similar in
 appearance to prior chest radiograph from ___ but different from ___. A new opacity along the right mid lung is identified and could
 represent early pneumonia. There are bibasilar opacities which are likely
 reflective of atelectasis. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right mid lung opacity, concerning for early pneumonia.
 
 2.  Enlarged mediastinum with an increased lucency which may represent a fat
 pad. Given differences in positional technique, however, further evaluation is
 recommended with a true PA and lateral chest radiograph. If findings persist,
 further examination with chest CT should be considered.
