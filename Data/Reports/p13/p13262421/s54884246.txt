                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Crackles at the lung bases with fatigue, evaluate for atelectasis
 or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate cardiomegaly,
 unchanged from prior.  Obscuration of the right lung base could be infectious
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  There are tiny bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tubing from a gastric band is noted
 within the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity at of right lung base would be consistent with pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
