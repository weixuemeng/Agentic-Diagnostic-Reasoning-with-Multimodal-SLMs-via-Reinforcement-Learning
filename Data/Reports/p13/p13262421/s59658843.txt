                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Since the prior exam, mild pulmonary
 edema has increased.  A small right pleural effusion is not significantly
 changed.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacification, which given the
 chronicity is likely atelectasis, and less likely pneumonia.  No new opacities
 are identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is moderately enlarged, and unchanged.  A right-sided hemodialysis catheter in
 stable position with the tip in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increase in mild pulmonary edema.  Stable small right pleural effusion.
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity, which given the chronicity is likely
 atelectasis and less likely pneumonia.  No new opacities are identified.
