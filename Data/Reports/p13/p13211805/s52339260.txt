 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pleuritic chest pain, assess for pneumonia.

 are low with bronchovascular crowding likely accounting for subtle opacities
 in the medial lung bases.  No convincing signs of pneumonia, CHF, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is stable.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable
 and unchanged.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
