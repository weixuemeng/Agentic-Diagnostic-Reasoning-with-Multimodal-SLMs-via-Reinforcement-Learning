                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hip dislocation.  Preop.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is increased opacity at the left lung base which
 obscures the lateral costophrenic angle and lateral hemidiaphragm.  This could
 be due to overlying soft tissues or potentially due to projection given
 significant rotation to the left; however, underlying effusion is not
 completely excluded.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear of confluent
 consolidation or evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Increased density projects in the lumbar vertebra
 suggestive of prior vertebroplasty.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
