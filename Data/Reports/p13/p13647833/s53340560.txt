                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis,
 obstruction/stricture of left hepatic system, status post left hepatic
 lobectomy, presenting with fevers, abdominal pain, now with tachycardia,
 shortness of breath.  Study requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 an increased right lower lobe density, which obscures the right hemidiaphragm.
 Lung volumes remain low. Atelectasis of the left lung base is unchanged. There
 is no pneumothorax. A right PICC line tip terminates in the mid to low SVC,
 unchanged position. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right lower lobe density, which may represent a
 combination of pleural effusion and consolidation.  However, given the
 patient's clinical presentation, the possibility of a pulmonary embolus should
 also be considered and further followup is recommended with a chest CT.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via
 telephone on ___ at 4:15 p.m., at time of discovery.
