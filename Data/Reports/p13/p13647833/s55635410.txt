                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  A nonspecific opacity is present in the right
 lower lobe, predominantly involving the retrocardiac region.  Considering
 recent liver surgery, this most likely represents an area of atelectasis, but
 pneumonic consolidation may have a similar appearance.  Additionally, there is
 a questionable small right pleural effusion.
