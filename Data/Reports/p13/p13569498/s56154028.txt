                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Bibasilar
 and lingular opacities are seen, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.  Findings
 appear increased from the prior study, although there are lower lung volumes
 on the prior study.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There are air-distended loops of
 bowel in the upper abdomen, not well evaluated.  If clinical concern, suggest
 dedicated abdomen radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left greater than right bibasilar and lingular opacities
 worrisome for pneumonia, increased as compared to the prior study.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.  If findings persist four to six weeks after acute
 treatment, suggest chest CT to exclude underlying obstructive process.
