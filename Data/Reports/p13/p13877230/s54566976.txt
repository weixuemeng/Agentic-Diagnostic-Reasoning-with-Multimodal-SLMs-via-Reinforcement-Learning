                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ETT  // intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None previous BID MC radiographs on PACs record for comparison. 
 No made of outside scanned-in chest x-ray from ___ dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 0.8 cm above the carina and points toward the right
 mainstem bronchus
 
 There is hyperinflation suggestive of probable background COPD.  Probable mild
 cardiomegaly.  Aorta is mildly tortuous.  A 7.7 mm calcific density in the AP
 view window likely represents calcified lymph node.  Small calcified granuloma
 may be present in the right upper zone.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 No consolidation, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion detected.
 
 An ovoid density measuring ___.9 mm overlies the cardiac silhouette immediately
 to the left of the lower thoracic spine, not fully characterized on this
 examination. This is new compared with an outside scanned-in radiograph from
 ___ and may represent artifact.
 
 Hazy density adjacent to the right upper chest wall, below the edge of the
 scapula is noted, but may also represent artifact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube terminates 0.8 mm above the carina.  Consider pulling back the ET tube
 by approximately 3 cm.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  Suspect
 background COPD.
 
 No consolidation, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion detected.
 
 Calcified node and probable small calcified granulomas, raising the
 possibility of prior granulomatous disease.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider pulling back the ET tube by 3 cm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with Dr. ___, ___D. by
 ___, ___D. on the telephone on ___ at 1:___ PM, ___ minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
