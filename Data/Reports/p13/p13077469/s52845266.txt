                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for the past three days, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, which otherwise appears within normal limits. 
 Streaky opacities at the bilateral lung bases, greater on the left than the
 right, most likely represents atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The visualized upper abdomen is relatively
 gasless.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
