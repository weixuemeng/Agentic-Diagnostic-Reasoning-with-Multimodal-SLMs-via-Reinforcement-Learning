                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with new onset of dyspnea
 on exertion, and congestive heart failure.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re-demonstrated, unchanged.  There is evidence of
 interstitial pulmonary edema that appears to be similar or potentially
 minimally improved since the prior examination.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema most likely minimally improved since ___.  Interstitial lung disease is a possibility given the lack of
 pleural effusion and if clinically warranted correlation with chest CT should
 be considered.
