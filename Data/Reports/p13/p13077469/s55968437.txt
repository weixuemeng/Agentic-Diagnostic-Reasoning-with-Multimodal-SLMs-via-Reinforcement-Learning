                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with malaise, fevers and
 shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is interval development of increased interstitial
 pattern in both lungs in the slightly perihilar fashion.  Those findings
 although might potentially represent minimal interstitial engorgement due to
 volume overload/pulmonary edema , although infectious process can be present
 in such a diffuse manner as well. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Given the patient's symptoms as well as the longevity of the
 symptoms, chest CT might be considered.  Alternatively, re-evaluation after
 diuresis may be considered to exclude the possibility of interstitial edema.
