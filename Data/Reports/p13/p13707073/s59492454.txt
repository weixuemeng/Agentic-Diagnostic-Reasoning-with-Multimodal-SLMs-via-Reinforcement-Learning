                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Small-bowel obstruction status post NG tube placement,
 preop chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube,
 terminating in the left upper quadrant in the expected position of the
 stomach.  No pleural effusion is seen.  There are subtle opacities projecting
 over the right mid lung which have slightly increased in extent as compared to
 the prior study, which could be due to infectious process, although underlying
 pulmonary nodules are not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
