                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are severe, worsening, diffuse interstitial abnormalities,
 particularly in the right upper lobe and the left perihilar region compared to
 the most recent prior studies from ___; these changes may be due to worsening
 NSIP, superimposed infection or lower lung volumes (or a combination therein).
 
 Cardiac silhouette is unchanged in size.  The aortic knob is calcified.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of the patient's diffuse interstitial abnormalities
 compatible with worsening NSIP and/or superimposed infection both of which are
 potentially accentuated by lower lung volumes.
