 HISTORY:  Spontaneous SAH, status post ET tube placement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is an endotracheal tube in the expected position, terminating 4.1 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A focal airspace opacity at the right lung
 base and may reflect atelectasis versus aspiration.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. An orogastric tube is seen terminating
 within the stomach. No acute bony abnormality is detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ETT terminating 4.1 cm above the carina.  
 
 2.  Right lower lobe airspace opacity, likely atelectasis versus aspiration.
