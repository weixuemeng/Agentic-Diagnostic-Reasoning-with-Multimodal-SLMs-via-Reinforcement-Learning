                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large subarachnoid hemorrhage.  New fevers.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 3.5 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field
 of view.  An esophageal temperature probe is present with the tip in the mid
 esophagus.  A right subclavian central venous catheter is present with the tip
 in the mid SVC.  The left central venous catheter has been removed.
 
 Since prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is a linear opacity at
 the right base which likely represents atelectasis.  No other opacity is
 identified.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar atelectasis.  No definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
