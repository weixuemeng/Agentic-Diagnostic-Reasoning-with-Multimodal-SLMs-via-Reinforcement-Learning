                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place.  Right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Right basal opacity is
 re-demonstrated and potentially might be reflecting infectious process being
 the source of fever.  Overall, the rest of the lungs are essentially clear.
