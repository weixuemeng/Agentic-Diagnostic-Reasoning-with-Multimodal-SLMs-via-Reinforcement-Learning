                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 mild bibasilar and mid lung atelectasis.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Patchy
 medial right base retrocardiac opacity is seen to most likely represent
 atelectasis/scarring on subsequent abdomen/pelvis CT.  No definite focal
 consolidation is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
