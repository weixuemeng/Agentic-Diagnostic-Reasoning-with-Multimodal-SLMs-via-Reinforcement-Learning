                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new retrocardiac opacity on KUB  // please
 evaluate for pneumonia, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiographs from ___, there is little
 overall change.  Bibasilar and left retrocardiac opacities are stable, likely
 reflecting atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia cannot be definitively
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No new focal consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax.  Small bilateral effusions are stable.  There is mild central
 vascular congestion with overt pulmonary edema.  Gaseous distention of loop of
 bowel in the left upper quadrant, presumably stomach, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent bibasilar and retrocardiac opacities likely represent
 atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia cannot be definitively excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Unchanged probable small pleural effusions.
 3. Mild central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
