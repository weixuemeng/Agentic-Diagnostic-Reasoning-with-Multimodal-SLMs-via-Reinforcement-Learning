                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute pancreatitis, concern for seizure,
 now with increasing O2 requirement, evaluate for pulmonary edema, evidence of
 atelectasis vs effusion or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of an enteric tube.  Low lung volumes and
 bibasilar airspace opacities are unchanged, likely representing a combination
 of pleural effusions and atelectasis. A superimposed infectious process is
 difficult to exclude.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema
 having improved.  There is persistent moderate dextroscoliosis of the upper
 thoracic spine.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is largely obscured by the
 bibasilar airspace opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
 pulmonary edema.
 2. Persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar opacification likely representing
 a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Superimposed pneumonia or
 aspiration is difficult to exclude.
