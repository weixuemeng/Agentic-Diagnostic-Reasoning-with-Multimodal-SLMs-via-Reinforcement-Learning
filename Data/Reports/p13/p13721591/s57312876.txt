                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure of unknown etiology 
 // eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 03:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the lines and tubes have been removed. There are
 low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again
 seen is patchy opacity at the left base, with air bronchograms. This appears
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior study, with some interval
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and new opacity along the left chest
 wall. The right infrahilar patchy opacity is similar to the prior film. Mild
 vascular plethora is more pronounced.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval worsening of opacity at left lung base, consistent with collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 2. Probable slight increase in vascular plethora/CHF.
