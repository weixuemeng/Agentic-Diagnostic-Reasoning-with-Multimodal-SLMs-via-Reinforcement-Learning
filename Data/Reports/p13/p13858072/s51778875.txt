                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 left retrocardiac patchy opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis,
 although underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.
