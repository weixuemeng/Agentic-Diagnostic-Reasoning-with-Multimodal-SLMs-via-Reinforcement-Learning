                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, now hypoxia, question
 pneumonia, CHF.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Lateral view is limited by overlying materials and blurring due to respiratory
 motion.  
 
 On the AP view, there are low inspiratory volumes, with patchy opacities at
 both bases, including retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not frankly enlarged,
 though there is a left ventricular configuration.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes. Doubt gross effusion.
 
 Probable diffuse osteopenia of the spine, which is not well visualized on this
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low inspiratory volumes, worse than on ___.
 
 2.  Otherwise, the findings are similar, though with slightly worse left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Patchy right cardiophrenic opacity again
 noted.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution.  Allowing for low lung volumes, no definite
 evidence of more extensive volume overload.
