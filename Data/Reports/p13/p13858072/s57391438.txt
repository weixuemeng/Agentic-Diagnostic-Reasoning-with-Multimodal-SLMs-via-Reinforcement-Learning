                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:10 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia and chest discomfort after anesthesia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Right hilus has enlarged and a region of infrahilar opacity, perhaps
 consolidation has coalesced since ___.  There is also new atelectasis
 at the left lung base and greater distention of mediastinal veins.  The
 presumption is new pneumonia or pulmonary embolus with infarction in the right
 lower lobe, and possible bronchospasm responsible for the atelectasis on the
 left.  In the setting of mild cardiomegaly, cardiac decompensation may be
 contributory.
 
 Findings reported after review of subsequent chest radiograph reported
 separately, performed at 6:48 a.m.
