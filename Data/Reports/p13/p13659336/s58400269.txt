                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis with ERCP, to assess for cause of infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, some prominence of the hila is
 again seen, possibly reflecting some degree of congestion.  Poor definition of
 the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  No gross
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
