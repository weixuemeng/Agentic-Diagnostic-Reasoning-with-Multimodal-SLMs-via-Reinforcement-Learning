                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with SOB, pleuritic CP.  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to recent chest x-ray, the opacification in the lungs
 bilaterally has improved. There is however persistent hazy opacity projecting
 over the right mid lung on the frontal localizing posteriorly on the lateral.
 Additional component is seen anteriorly as well. In combination with findings
 on prior CT, these are likely due to loculated effusion, empyema would be
 possible. Component of layering pleural effusions are also noted bilaterally
 although smaller when compared to prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the right hemithorax with a configuration suggesting loculated
 effusions, empyemas are possible. Overall, bilateral parenchymal opacities
 have improved since recent chest x-ray from ___.
