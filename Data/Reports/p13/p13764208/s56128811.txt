 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R VATS decort  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No interval change from prior study.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 position. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged. Diffuse right lung opacity is a combination of effusion and
 atelectasis, probably unchanged from prior study allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.   Small left effusion with adjacent atelectasis
 has increased.
