  Right internal jugular central venous line terminates at the superior
  cavoatrial junction.  ET tube tip is 1.7cm above the carina.  The proximal
  side hole of the more medial right chest tube overlies the right lower lung
  field, however the inferior and lateral chest tube's proximal side hole is
  just within the lateral border of the thoracic cage, and may warrant
  advancement. Small amount of subcutaneous air adjacent to the right rib margin
  is new likely from new chest tube placement.  -___ discussed with Dr. ___

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new R chest tubes and R IJ CVL  // confirm
 position chest tubes and CVL
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed 8 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the SVC. ET tube tip is just 1.7 cm above the
 Carina. There is no pneumothorax. New second right chest tube is present.
 Previously seen right more basal chest tube has been pulled back several cm.
 proximal side hole is just within the lateral border of the thoracic cage, and
 may warrant advancement.  No other interval change from prior study.
