                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea and increased oxygen demand.  Recent appendectomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT abdomen and pelvis ___, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal with mild unfolding of the thoracic aortic arch.  Left
 hilar contour is normal. Right hilar contour is not well assessed due to
 presence of a moderate right pleural effusion which was partially visualized
 on the same day outside CT examination. This right pleural effusion appears
 partially loculated on CT from earlier today.  Increased adjacent densities
 may be secondary to compressive atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
 There is mild linear left base atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Partially loculated right pleural effusion.  Adjacent compressive atelectasis,
 cannot exclude pneumonia. Small pneumoperitoneum better assessed on CT.
