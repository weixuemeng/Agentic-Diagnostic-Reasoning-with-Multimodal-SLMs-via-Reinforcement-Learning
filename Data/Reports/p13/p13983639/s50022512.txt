                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities are demonstrated in the lung
 bases. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted. No pneumothorax is
 present. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis,
 aspiration or infection, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
