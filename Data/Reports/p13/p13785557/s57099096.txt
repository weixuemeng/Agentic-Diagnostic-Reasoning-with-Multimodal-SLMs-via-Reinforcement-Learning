 AP CHEST, 7:49 P.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever spike.  Positive PPD.  G-tube placed.  Is
 there pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to pre-operative chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Well-circumscribed geographic areas of opacification in the lower lungs are
 usually due to atelectasis rather than pneumonia.  Aspiration of course could
 be the cause, and would predispose to subsequent development of pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion.  Heart size top normal, unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
