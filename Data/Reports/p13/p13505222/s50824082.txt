                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change, history of breast cancer
 with persistent cough, hypoxia, and low-grade fevers and bilateral
 ground-glass opacities on CT, receiving steroids as part of chemo regimen.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 5:12.
 
 PA and lateral views are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian Port-A-Cath has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. 
 Although lung volumes are relatively low, the overall interstitium appears
 within normal limits.  No focal airspace consolidation is appreciated at this
 time.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.  Please note, however, that chest CT is far more sensitive to detect
 ground-glass opacity than a conventional plain film.
