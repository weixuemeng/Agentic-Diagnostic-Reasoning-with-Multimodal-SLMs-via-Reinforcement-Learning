                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with history of breast cancer, on Taxol,
 presenting with dyspnea, fever and ground-glass opacities on CT concerning for
 pneumonia, to assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 18:16.
 
 A portable semi-upright chest film, ___ at 5:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line with its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. 
 Interval improvement in aeration but a persistent bilateral interstitial
 airspace process is again seen, which could represent an atypical pneumonia or
 drug toxicity.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  There is slight prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery in this patient with known pulmonary hypertension.  No
 pneumothorax.
