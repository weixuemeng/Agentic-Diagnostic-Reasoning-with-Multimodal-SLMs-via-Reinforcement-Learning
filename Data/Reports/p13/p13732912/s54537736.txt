                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pleuritic left chest pain and history
 of effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus likely represents pleural scarring,
 but in the absence of prior imaging, a new tiny effusion cannot be excluded. 
 There is no right effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  No osseous abnormality is identified.  No free air
 under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus is likely scarring, but
 new tiny effusion cannot be excluded, particularly without the benefit of
 comparison to prior imaging.
