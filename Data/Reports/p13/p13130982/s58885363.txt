                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with crackles  // r/o consolidation      r/o
 consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval 's change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 09:21 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality with a suggestion of some
 peribronchial cuffing. Therefore, these findings are most consistent with mild
 interstitial edema rather than underlying interstitial lung disease or an
 atypical infection.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The heart is enlarged most likely
 reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. 
 The apices are obscured by the patient's mandible but no obvious pneumothorax
 is seen.  No large pleural effusions are evident.
