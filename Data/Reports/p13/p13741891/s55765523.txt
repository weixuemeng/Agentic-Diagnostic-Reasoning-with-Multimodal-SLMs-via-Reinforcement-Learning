                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever, shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are

 linear atelectasis/scarring.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, making evaluation of the lateral view
 suboptimal.  Given this, there is bibasilar linear atelectasis/scarring
 without definite focal consolidation.
