 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, shortness of breath, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided central
 venous access line has been removed and has been replaced by a left-sided PICC
 line.  The parenchymal opacities that preexisted bilaterally are now slightly
 more extensive.  This is particularly obvious at the bases of the right upper
 lobe as well as at the lung base on the left.  The left could display a
 minimal newly occurred pleural effusion.  Unchanged size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged minimal fluid overload.
