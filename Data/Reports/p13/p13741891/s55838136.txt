                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:06 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided crackles, hypotension, and elevated white count, raising
 concern for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Yesterday's chest radiograph showed mediastinal and pulmonary vascular
 congestion suggesting cardiac decompensation, and today, there is mild
 pulmonary edema in the right lung.  Therefore, greater opacification at the
 left base is more likely to be a combination of atelectasis and edema than
 pneumonia, although infection is not excluded.  The heart is normal size.  No
 pneumothorax.  Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC.
