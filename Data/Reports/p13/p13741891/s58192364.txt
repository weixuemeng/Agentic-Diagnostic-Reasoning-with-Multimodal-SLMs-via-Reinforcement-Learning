                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MS, septic shock, question blossoming pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The areas of bibasilar atelectasis are essentially unchanged.  No new focal
 opacity is detected on the frontal view.  No definite focal infiltrate on the
 lateral view, which is degraded by respiratory motion.  No effusion.  No CHF
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar opacities -- ? atelectasis and/or scarring -- are unchanged.  Due to
 respiratory motion, there is limited assessment for focal infiltrate on the
 lateral view.
