                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Leukocytosis with concern for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of chest were obtained.  A left arm PICC line
 is again seen with tip residing in the region of the superior vena cava. 
 Improved aeration in the lungs is noted compared with prior exam, though there
 is persistent small right pleural effusion and areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis.  A retrocardiac density could represent left lower lobe
 consolidation, though this is not clearly assessed on the lateral view.
 Mediastinal contour is stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right effusion and scattered lower lung atelectasis. 
 Retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
