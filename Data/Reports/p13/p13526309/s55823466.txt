                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present, but interstitial edema has nearly
 resolved.  Moderate right pleural effusion appears increased in size, with
 adjacent worsening atelectasis and/or consolidation in right middle and right
 lower lobes.  Left pleural effusion has decreased in size with associated
 improved atelectasis at the left base.
