                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation of pleural effusions in a patient status post below the
 knee amputation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___, 9
 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral upright views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  The patient is markedly rotated to the right which distorts
 the mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes that are likely unchanged.  Accounting
 for patient rotation, the large right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged
 and the small left pleural effusion is slightly increased.  A left PICC ends
 in the upper superior vena cava.  Right middle lobe, right lower lobe collapse
 and left basilar atelectasis are relatively unchanged there is no vascular
 engorgement, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Median sternotomy wire are
 intact and aligned.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Accounting for patient rotation, the large right pleural effusion is
 relatively unchanged in the small left pleural effusion has slightly
 increased.
