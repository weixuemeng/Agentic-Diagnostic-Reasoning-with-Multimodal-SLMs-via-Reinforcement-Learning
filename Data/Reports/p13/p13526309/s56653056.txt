                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with PICC line in place.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Left PICC is again seen.  On
 the current exam, the tip is not definitively identified, but is thought to be
 in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  Appearance of the lungs has not
 changed.  Persistent right basilar opacity is seen with blunting of the right
 lateral costophrenic angle with linear adjacent opacities, suggesting effusion
 and underlying atelectasis, noting infection cannot be excluded, similar to
 prior.  The left lung is grossly clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Multiple median sternotomy wires are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left PICC identified, noting that tip is not clearly seen but is
 likely in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  No change from prior.
