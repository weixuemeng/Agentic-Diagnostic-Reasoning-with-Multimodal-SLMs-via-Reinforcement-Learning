  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Interval
  increase in left lung base opacity, could be secondary to atelectasis, however
  an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pleurx catheter overlies the lower right hemithorax.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion has slightly changed in distribution but is overall
 similar in size.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Worsening atelectasis
 in the right middle and right lower lobes as well as development of a
 confluent opacity at the left base.  The latter may be due to aspiration and
 less likely asymmetrical edema.  Small pleural effusions are present
 bilaterally and note is made of multiple compression deformities in the spine,
 more fully evaluated by sagittal reformatted images from recent CTA of the
 chest of ___.
