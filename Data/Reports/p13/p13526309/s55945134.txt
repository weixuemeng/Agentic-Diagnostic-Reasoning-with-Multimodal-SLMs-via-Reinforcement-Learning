                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post exploratory laparotomy and
 right-sided colectomy.
 
 Several recent portable chest examinations demonstrated evidence of right
 lower lobe and middle lobe collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's condition required examination in sitting position
 using AP frontal and left lateral views.  There is status post sternotomy and
 evidence of bypass surgery with multiple metallic surgical clips in the
 anterior left-sided mediastinum and ring-shaped graft markers at the anterior
 wall of the ascending aorta.  Heart size cannot be assessed because of
 right-sided basal pulmonary densities concealing the cardiac contours.  Marked
 cardiomegaly is unlikely.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There
 is mild blunting of the left lateral and posterior pleural sinus, indicating
 small amount of pleural effusions on that side.  Lungs are clear in the left
 hemithorax.  On the right lung base, a diffuse density is observed obscuring
 completely the contour of the right-sided hemidiaphragm.  This finding is
 identified as lobe collapse and appears to be unchanged.  Comparison with a
 frontal chest examination of ___, demonstrates the findings prior
 to the collapse and showed normal diaphragmatic contours and well ventilated
 right lower lobe and middle lobe structures with absence of any pleural
 effusion.  Status post bypass surgery existed already at that time.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lung base findings consistent with right middle
 lobe and lower lobe collapse.  Additional thickening of lateral pleural space
 on right side, indicative of additional pleural effusion.  Cause of the
 collapse is not clear on the plain chest examinations. Unless airway
 exploration is performed to exclude central airway obstruction airway, a chest
 CT is recommended to diagnose the cause of the major lung collapse.
