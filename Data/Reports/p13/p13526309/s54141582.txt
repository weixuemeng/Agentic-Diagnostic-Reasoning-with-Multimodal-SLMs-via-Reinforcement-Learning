                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent Pleurx catheter worsening shortness of breath.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:08.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the right pleural drain
 in unchanged position with the pleural effusion now tracking superiorly likely
 related to positioning. Subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is unchanged.
 There is increased volume loss in the right lung with rightward shift of the
 mediastinum and worsening atelectasis. New opacities in the right upper and
 lower lung likely reflect atelectasis given the short interval time between
 the prior study.  No pneumothorax.
