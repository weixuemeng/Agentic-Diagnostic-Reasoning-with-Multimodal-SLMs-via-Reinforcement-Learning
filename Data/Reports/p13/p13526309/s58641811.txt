                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Malignant effusions, determine port placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Compared with chest x-ray from ___ at 8:47 a.m. , no gross change is
 identified.  
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with CABG clips and enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to prior.  
 
 There is a relatively small right effusion, possibly slightly decreased
 compared with the prior film.  Generalized increased density of the markings
 in the right lung compared to the left are noted, 
 ?due to unilateral vascular plethora. 
 
 Doubt left-sided CHF. The small left effusion has improved.  There is some
 persistent collapse and/or consolidation at the left base, which is also
 likely improved.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in left effusion.  Possible slight decrease in
 right effusion.  Asymmetry of the vascular markings, which appear more
 increased on the right, is similar to the prior film, ? asymmetric vascular
 plethora/CHF.
