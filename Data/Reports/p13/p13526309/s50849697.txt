                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rising white blood cell count, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation is seen on this limited portable AP view of the chest. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There is stable appearance of
 mild cardiomegaly.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Median sternotomy wires are unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia on this limited portable AP view; however, if
 clinical concern persists could consider a standard PA and lateral view if the
 patient is able to tolerate, as a retrocardiac opacity might not be
 appreciated on this view.
