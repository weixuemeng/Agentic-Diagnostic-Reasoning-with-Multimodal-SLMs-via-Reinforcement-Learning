                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion after chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially
 lower lung volumes.  There is a moderate right effusion with compressive
 atelectasis at the base.  The degree of effusion is difficult to assess
 considering the different inspiration level, though it is probably either
 quite similar or slightly increased.
 
 The left lung is essentially clear, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, and unchanged position of the central catheter.  The
 degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially reduced.
