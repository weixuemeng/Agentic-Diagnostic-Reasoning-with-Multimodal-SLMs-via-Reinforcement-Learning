                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleurx and pleural effusions, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ AT 15:02 PM.
 
 A catheter is seen at the right lung base.  Compared to the prior CXR, the
 right pleural effusion is slightly decreased.  The CHF findings, though still
 present, appear slightly less pronounced.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change. No gross pneumothorax.
