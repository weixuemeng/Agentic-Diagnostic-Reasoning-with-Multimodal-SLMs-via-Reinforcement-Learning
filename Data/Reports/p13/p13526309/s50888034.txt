                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds at the left base. 
 Question metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent chest CT and FDG PET imaging studies from ___
 and ___, respectively.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an increasing pleural effusion on the right, now at least
 moderate size, and probably a trace one on the left side.  Associated opacity
 can probably be explained by atelectasis in the right lower and middle lobes. 
 Projecting over the right mid lung is a rounded mass-like opacity measuring
 about 4 cm in diameter, possibly an increasing metastatic nodule.  Patchy
 opacity at the left lung base is probably due to minor atelectasis. 
 Compression deformities along the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spines are
 probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  Known metastases
 into the bones are not well demonstrated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing right-sided pleural effusion.  Right lung mass,
 probably increased substantially, although comparison of different modalities
 is not entirely reliable.  CT may be helpful to evaluate further if needed
 clinically.
