                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:46 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, pleural effusions
 and increasing shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have both
 increased.  Lung bases are obscured, but there appears to be opacification in
 both lower lungs, whether atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically
 indeterminate and a more discrete mass-like 22 mm wide lesion at the upper
 pole of the left hilus, which could be a metastasis, less likely, infection. 
 Cardiac silhouette is obscured.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right
 supraclavicular central venous infusion pump ends in the right atrium.
 
 Dr. ___ paged today at 8:20 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
