                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right PleurX catheter placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right pleural catheter which
 is extremely difficult to visualize but is likely present at the right lung
 base. There is a new right apical pneumothorax measuring 1.2 cm.  There has
 been interval slight decrease in the now moderately sized right pleural
 effusion.  Left pleural effusion is stable in size.  Cardiac size cannot be
 assessed due to these pleural effusions.  Increased interstitial markings
 bilaterally may represent worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New pleural catheter placement with resultant right apical
 pneumothorax.  No signs of tension.
