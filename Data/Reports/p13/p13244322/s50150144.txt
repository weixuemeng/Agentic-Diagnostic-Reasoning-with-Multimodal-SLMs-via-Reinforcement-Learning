                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxic resp failure likely ___ PNA. Has
 bloody secretions in trachea. ?diffuse alveolar hemorrhage? concern for DIC on
 labs  // placement of ET tube?     placement of ET tube?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive bilateral perihilar consolidative abnormalities developed between
 ___ and ___ they accompanied chronic moderate to severe cardiomegaly
 and were therefore attributed to pulmonary edema.  The lower lobe components
 have improved slightly, but the right upper lobe component is still quite
 severe.  I still believe most of the abnormality was due to pulmonary edema
 but there may be concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 
 Newly placed ET tube is in standard position, but its diameter, 11 mm, may be
 smaller than ideal for the caliber of the trachea, 29 mm.  Clinical
 correlation advised.
 
 Pleural effusions are small.  There is no pneumothorax.
