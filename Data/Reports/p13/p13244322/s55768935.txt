                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, bilateral crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The patient's chin obscures the lung apices.  Lordotic
 positioning of the patient slightly limits assessment.  Heart size is
 moderately enlarged, and accentuated due to low lung volumes.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged with re-
 demonstration of rightward deviation of the upper trachea.  There is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The patient is status post vertebroplasty of a lumbar vertebral body. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
