                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of central line placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been no significant interval change of the
 diffuse nodular and patchy bilateral airspace opacity compared to the prior
 exam performed at 4:35 p.m. on the same day.  The mediastinum overall appears
 widened.  There is a right-sided internal jugular line with the tip in the mid
 SVC.  The aortic knob again appears to be calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, no significant interval change of the bilateral nodular
 and patchy airspace opacities, likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the
 setting of congestive heart failure.  Right-sided IJ line terminates in the
 lower SVC.
