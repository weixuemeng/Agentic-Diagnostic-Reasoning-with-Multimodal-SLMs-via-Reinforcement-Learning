                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p arrest, ARDS ___ R asp PNA  // Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, moderate to large right
 pleural effusion is similar, but a moderate left pleural effusion has
 apparently increased in size.  Bilateral perihilar opacities appear more
 symmetrical than on the prior study and are likely due to pulmonary edema.
