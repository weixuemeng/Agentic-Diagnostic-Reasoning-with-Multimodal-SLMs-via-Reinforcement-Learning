                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M post arrest, bilateral infiltrates c/f ARDS vs alveolar
 hemorrhage  // Evaluate for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube terminates at the level of the upper clavicles, but could be
 advanced by 2-3 cm for more optimal ventilation. A right IJ central venous
 catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  A nasogastric tube coils in the
 stomach.  There has been marked improved aeration of the lung long, however
 substantial airspace opacification of the entire right lung and left perihilar
 location are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.  New moderate right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the left lung as compared to the study of 1 day prior.
 High-riding ET tube could be advanced by 2-3 cm from more optimal aeration.
 Persistent extensive right lung edema or hemorrhage may either be due to a
 continuation of the same process or new aspiration.
 Stable moderate right pleural effusion.
