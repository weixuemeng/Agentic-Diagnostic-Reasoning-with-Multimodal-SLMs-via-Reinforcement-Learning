 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable crackles.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort.  There is crowding of
 vascular and interstitial structures at the lung bases.  However, there is no
 focal parenchymal opacity that would suggest pneumonia.  Borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette.  No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
