                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Gram-positive cocci bacteremia with altered mental status. 
 Assess for pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  A mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality likely reflects mild interstitial pulmonary edema, not
 significantly changed.  There is minimal left retrocardiac atelectasis,
 increased.  There is no focal consolidation.  Moderate-to-severe enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is again noted with evidence of left atrial
 enlargement.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, not significantly changed.  No focal
 consolidation.
 
 2.  Unchanged moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 evidence of left atrial enlargement.
