                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post cardiac arrest, intubated into right mainstem
 bronchus, now endotracheal tube withdrawn, check position.
 
 CHEST:  The tip of the endotracheal tube lies 3 cm from the carinal angle. 
 Some atelectasis is present in the left lower lobe consistent with previous
 collapse but it does suggest re-expansion is occurring.  Some atelectasis and
 opacification in the right upper lobe is seen, probably also secondary to the
 malposition of the endotracheal tube.  Elsewhere, the lung fields are clear.
