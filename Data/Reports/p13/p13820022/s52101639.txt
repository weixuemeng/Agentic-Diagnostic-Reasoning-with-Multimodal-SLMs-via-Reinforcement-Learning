 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:00 PM
  Lung volumes are low.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm has increased. 
  Right IJ line terminates in right atrium.  An endotracheal tube terminates
  approximately 7 centimeters above the carina, at the lower margin of the
  clavicles.  Is the tip of the the orogastric tube is not well seen but appears
  to overlie the carina.  Advancement of the orogastric tube and repeat
  radiograph is suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE PLAIN FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post cardiac arrest, confirm tube
 placement.  Question aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 8:13 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina.  Right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial
 junction.  The orogastric tube is seen down to the level of the carina and the
 tip is not clearly seen, although there is a curvilinear opacity in the region
 of the stomach.  Follow-up imaging after advancement would be advised.  Lung
 volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting
 bibasilar atelectasis, although aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
