 1.  Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line and nasogastric
 tube are unchanged in position.  Lung volumes remain low, but there has been
 interval resolution of the pulmonary edema.  There are persistent streaky
 opacities in the right mid and left lower lung suggestive of subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given lordotic
 technique on the current examination.
