 There are continued low lung volumes.  Endotracheal tube has been removed and
 the right PICC line extends to the lower SVC.
 
 There is some asymmetry of opacification at the bases, more prominent on the
 left.  This could reflect technical artifact or atelectatic change.  However,
 if there are clinical findings suggestive of pneumonia, this would have to be
 considered.
