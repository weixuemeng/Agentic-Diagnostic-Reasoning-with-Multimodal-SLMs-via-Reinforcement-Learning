                                 FINAL REPORT
 Status post cardiac arrest, now intubated.
 
 CHEST
 
 The position of the various support lines and tubes is satisfactory and
 unchanged.
 
 Some opacities are now present in the right lower lobe and the perihilar
 markings appear somewhat more prominent.  This suggests the presence of some
 failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Early signs of cardiac failure.
