                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 750 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 751 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. 
 The nasogastric tube is now seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tube
 coiled within a non-distended stomach.  Lung volumes remain low with patchy
 bibasilar opacities likely representing bibasilar atelectasis, although
 aspiration cannot be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
