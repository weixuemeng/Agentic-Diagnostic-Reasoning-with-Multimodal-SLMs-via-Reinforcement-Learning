 INDICATION:   ___F with SBO and NGT  // confirm NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and ___ and CT
 abdomen pelvis from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without confluent consolidation or large effusion.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted, likely in part due to
 prominent mediastinal fat.  Enlarged left hilum is again seen, presumably due
 to enlargement of the pulmonary artery in the setting of pulmonary
 hypertension although possibility of adenopathy is not excluded.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.  Enteric tube seen passing the on the GE junction, tip
 not definitively identified.  No free air below the diaphragm.
