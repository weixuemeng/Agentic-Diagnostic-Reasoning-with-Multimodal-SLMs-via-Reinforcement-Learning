                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the abnormality on prior chest
 radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT of the abdomen from
 ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the proximal stomach. 
 Since the prior examination, there has been additional improvement of the left
 basal lung aeration.  Substantial prominence of the main pulmonary artery
 might be consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension.  Correlation with
 echocardiography if not previously obtained or cross-sectional chest imaging
 such as chest CT might be considered.  Minimal interstitial engorgement is
 present that might reflect mild interstitial edema, unchanged or improved
 since the prior study.  The patient was extubated in the meantime interval.
