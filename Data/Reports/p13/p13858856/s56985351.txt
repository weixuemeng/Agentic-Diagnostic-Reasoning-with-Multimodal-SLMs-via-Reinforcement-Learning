                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Follow-up of abnormal radiograph.  Patient with abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lung volumes remain low.  There are persistent patchy opacities in the lower
 lungs, but somewhat better aerated and expanded, suggesting partial resolution
 of what is probably, at least predominantly, atelectasis.  Background
 prominence of pulmonary vascularity with indistinct vessels suggests fluid
 overload.  A curvilinear shadow continues to project over the right upper
 lung.  Lung markings are clearly seen beyond it, but it is difficult to
 entirely exclude the possibility of a pneumothorax involving partial
 retraction of the right upper lobe, although doubted.  There is no free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial improvement in right basilar opacities.  Persistent
 findings suggesting fluid overload.  Persistent shadow projecting over the
 right upper thorax, which raises concern for the possibility of an unusual
 imaging appearance of pneumothorax; although doubted, chest CT are short-term
 followup radiograph should be considered to exclude the diagnosis, in addition
 to correlation with whether there has been any recent prior history of
 instrumentation.
