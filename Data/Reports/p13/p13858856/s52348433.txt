                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and hypotension.  Question free air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There are patchy new opacities in the
 lower lungs.  Most often these could be attributed to atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes, but not entirely specific.  In addition, the
 pulmonary vasculature appears indistinct and prominent suggesting fluid
 overload.  A curvilinear line projecting over the right upper hemithorax
 mimics pneumothorax, although the clear presence of lung markings beyond the
 edge of the shadow and the lack of medial delineation of the shadow make an
 artifact more likely than a real pneumothorax.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  The gastric bubble projects over the left upper quadrant, but there
 is no definite free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Curvilinear interface projecting over the right upper lung, which mimics a
 pneumothorax, although it is probably an artifact.  Repeat chest radiography
 is suggested to confirm.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Patchy lower lobe opacities, most suggestive of atelectasis in the setting
 of quite low lung volumes, although other etiologies such as pneumonia or
 aspiration are not excluded by this study.
 
 4.  No evidence for free intraperitoneal air.
