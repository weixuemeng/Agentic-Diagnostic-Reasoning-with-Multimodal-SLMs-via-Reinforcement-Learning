                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pseudomonas pneumonia, evaluate for
 evolving pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The patient remains intubated, the ETT in
 unchanged position terminating approximately 3 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Unchanged position of previously identified PICC line in mid portion
 of the SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Heart size is unchanged and no
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  The hazy right-sided basal density
 observed on the preceding examination is again noted and appears rather
 unchanged.  Thus, no radiographic evidence of progression of the previously
 identified pneumonia.  No other new pulmonary abnormalities.  A Dobbhoff line
 is now seen conclusively to be curled up in the fundus of the stomach.
