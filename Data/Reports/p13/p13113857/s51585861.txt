                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest ___, portable technique, earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post bilateral upper lobe wedge resection
 procedures, and fiducial seeds are also demonstated. A confluent opacity is
 present in the right suprahilar region projecting posteriorly in close
 proximity to surgical chain sutures.  
 
 Lungs are overinflated with evidence of bullous emphysema in the retrosternal
 region.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable for scattered areas of linear
 parenchymal scarring.  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral hilar enlargement is
 present, with persistent asymmetry, right greater than left.  Although
 possibly related to pulmonary hypertension, the presence of lymphadenopathy
 should be considered. Focal eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is present
 posteriorly.  No definite pleural effusions.  Diffuse osseous demineralization
 is noted as well as a wedge compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine
 which is of indeterminate age.  Healed rib fractures are present bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Confluent mass-like opacity adjacent to surgical chain sutures in
 the right suprahilar region. Although possibly due to a focal pneumonia in the
 setting of COPD exacerbation, a neoplastic mass is also an important
 consideration in this patient with history of lung malignancy.  
 
 In the absence of prior baseline CXR for comparison, CT of the chest ___ be
 helpful both to better characterize the focal lung abnormality, and to
 evaluate for possible right hilar lymphadenopathy.
 
 Findings communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 4:05 p.m. at the time of
 discovery on ___.
