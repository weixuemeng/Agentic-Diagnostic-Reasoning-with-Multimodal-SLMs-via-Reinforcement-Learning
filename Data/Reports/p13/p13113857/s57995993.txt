                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac contour is unremarkable.  Chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease is noted.  Chain sutures and surgical clips are
 seen in the upper lobes with associated volume loss and architectural
 distortion. Surgical clips are also noted in the mid right hemithorax.  Old
 right upper rib deformities are identified.  
 
 Both hila are enlarged and upwardly retracted. However, the right hilum is
 more dense and larger compared to the left. No focal consolidation,  or
 pneumothorax is noted. Bilateral costophrenic angle blunting is present and
 linear scarring atelectasis is noted in the right lung base. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Prominant right hilum. Recommend initial further evaluation with PA and
 lateral CXR to differentiate pulmonary artery enlargement from a hilar mass.
 Contrast-enhanced CT may also be considered, especially if the patient's prior
 surgeries were for lung malignancy.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:30 am on ___ via
 telephone. Critical finding was discovered at 7:20am on ___. 
 
 2. Small pleural effusions or pleural thickening.
