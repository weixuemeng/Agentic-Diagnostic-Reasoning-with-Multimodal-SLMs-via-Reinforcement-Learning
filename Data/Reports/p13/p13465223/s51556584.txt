 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe mass on chest CT, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison is available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The 1.5 cm left-sided nodular lesion adjacent to the chest wall,
 documented on the CT examination from ___, is seen partly projecting
 over the left scapula.  The lesion is less well defined than on the CT
 examination and better appreciated on the frontal than on the lateral
 radiograph.  There currently is no evidence of coexisting finding such as
 pleural effusions, pneumonia or other nodular lesions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
