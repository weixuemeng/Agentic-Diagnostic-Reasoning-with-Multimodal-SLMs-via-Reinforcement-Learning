                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC,
 similar from prior. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is borderline
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated, and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion may be present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are compatible
 with areas of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
