                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with seizure, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left basal opacity, minimal but new, potentially representing
 atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. No other focal consolidation is
 seen, and the lungs are clear of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe opacity, potentially pneumonia, but atelectasis is a
 possibility.
