                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Free intraperitoneal air is present, likely due to recent PEG
 placement.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Marked interval worsening in left retrocardiac
 opacity, likely a combination of moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Layering right pleural effusion with
 adjacent basilar atelectasis has slightly improved.  No visible pneumothorax.
