                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with persistent fevers, on hemodialysis,
 worsening cough, evaluate for possible acute pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two AP frontal images were obtained to cover the entire thorax on
 this portable bedside examination.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  Position of previously
 described dialysis catheter and central venous line unchanged.  The previously
 observed parenchymal densities occupying the right-sided cardio-diaphragmatic
 angle on this portable chest examination appears unchanged.  Improvement has
 occurred in a left upper lobe density which was described as a linearly
 oriented atelectasis in the left juxtahilar region.
 
 No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen, and no pulmonary vascular congestion
 is identified.  A chest CT of ___, i.e. obtained between these two
 portable chest examinations is reviewed.  It showed some plate atelectasis in
 the area, but no conclusive evidence for discrete pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of new pneumonic infiltrate. 
 No pneumothorax.
