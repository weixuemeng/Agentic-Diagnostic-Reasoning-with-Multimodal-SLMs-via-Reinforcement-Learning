  Single view demonstrates low lung volumes without detectable focal
  consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Linear
  opacity in the left mid lung likely represents atelectasis.

 HISTORY:  Productive cough and unexplained fever after transplant.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes. 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Cardiac silhouette is within

 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
 
 An incidental note is striking displacement of the stomach to the right,
 consistent with pronounced splenomegaly.
