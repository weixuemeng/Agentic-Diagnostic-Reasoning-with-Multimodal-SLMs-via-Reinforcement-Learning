 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, pleurocentesis.  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 left pleurocentesis.  There is a pleural drain projecting over the left
 costophrenic sinus.  No evidence of pneumothorax or left-sided pleural
 effusion.  Unchanged small right pneumothorax, unchanged bibasilar areas of
 plate-like atelectasis.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Overall,
 low lung volumes.
