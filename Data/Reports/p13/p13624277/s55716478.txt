                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, there is negligible interval change.  Again seen is an
 elevated right hemidiaphragm with increased opacity at both lung bases and
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.  Borderline upper zone
 redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.  Right-sided dual-lumen catheter,
 unchanged.
