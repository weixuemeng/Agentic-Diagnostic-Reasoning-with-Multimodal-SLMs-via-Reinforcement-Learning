                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cardiomyopathy and hip fracture, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, 7:49 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right upper extremity PICC terminates in the mid
 SVC.
 
 There is persistent moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  Mild pulmonary edema has
 increased slightly from 10 hours prior.  There has been minimal increase in
 the small right pleural effusion and persistence of the left pleural effusion.
 No pneumothorax.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacification which is
 likely atelectasis, however, pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
