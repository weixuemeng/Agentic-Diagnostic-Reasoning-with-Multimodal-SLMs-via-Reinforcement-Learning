  Moderate cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate
  to severe interstitial edema.  Probable small bilateral effusions.  Infection
  cannot be excluded in the appropriate circumstance.

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ WITH NO PRIOR STUDIES FOR COMPARISON
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged.  Aorta is diffusely
 tortuous and potentially mildly dilated in the ascending region, difficult to
 assess on this portable semi-upright study.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is
 accompanied by interstitial edema and asymmetrical perihilar haziness on the
 right.  The latter likely represents asymmetric edema but coexisting infection
 is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Patchy opacities are
 present at both lung bases, and there is also a small right pleural effusion
 present but no visible pneumothorax.  Followup radiographs after diuresis
 would be helpful to confirm resolution of the interstitial abnormalities and
 to exclude the possibility of a more chronic interstitial process.
