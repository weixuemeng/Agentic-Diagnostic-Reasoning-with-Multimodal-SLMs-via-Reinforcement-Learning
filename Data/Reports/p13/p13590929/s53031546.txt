                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with crackles.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single supine portable view of the chest.  There is increased opacity
 projecting over the left hilar region which could be due to parenchymal
 opacity or enlarged left hilum due nodes or enlarged pulmonary artery.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear of focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits for technique.  Mid thoracic
 dextroscoliosis is identified.  Rounded radiopaque density projects over the
 left upper quadrant.  There is also increased lucency projecting below the
 right hemidiaphragm, some of which may be within bowel however there may also
 be component of free intraperitoneal air.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Rounded radiopaque body projecting over the left upper quadrant.  As this was
 not external to the patient on exem, it may be internal.  Additional views may
 help further characterize.
 
 Increase lucency projecting over the right upper abdomen raising concern for
 free intraperitoneal air although some may be within interposed colonic loops
 additional imaging is suggested and can be performed with upright or lateral
 decubitus views va CT scan.  
 
 Increased density projecting over the left hilum could be within the lung and
 represent parenchymal opacity versus enlargement of the left hilum from
 adenopathy or pulmonary artery.  Additional imaging suggested when patient is
 amenable.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 18:18 over the phone by Dr. ___
 ___ min after time of discovery.
