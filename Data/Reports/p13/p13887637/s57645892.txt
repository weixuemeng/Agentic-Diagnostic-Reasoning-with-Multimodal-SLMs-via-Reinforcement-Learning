                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever in patient with Burkitt's lymphoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extremely lordotic view makes it difficult to evaluate the heart
 and lungs.  Nevertheless, there is no definite evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely represents atelectasis,
 though a supervening focus of infection in this region cannot be definitely
 excluded.
