                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Burkitt's lymphoma, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of bilateral basal opacities.  Their distribution and symmetry suggest
 atelectasis rather than infection.  No newly occurred parenchymal opacities. 
 Low lung volumes and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural
 effusions.  
 
 Unchanged right Port-A-Cath.
