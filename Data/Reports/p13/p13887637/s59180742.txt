 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:40 PM
  Bulkly right hilar adenopathy, as before.  Minimal heterogenous opacity at the
  right medial lung base could be projectional; a lateral radiograph could left
  exclude an infectious process in this region.  Otherwise, clear lungs.
  ___ d/w Dr. ___ at 9:40 p.m. via telephone on the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known Burkitt lymphoma, status post chemotherapy with febrile
 neutropenia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is right infrahilar density in the
 setting of known right hilar adenopathy, possibly slightly increased compared
 with ___.  There is minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity.  There is
 borderline upper zone redistribution.  No gross effusion.  Right-sided
 indwelling catheter, likely stable. Possible left hilar adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low inspiratory volumes.  Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic
 region may be projectional vs new infiltrate.  If clinically indicated,
 lateral view may help for further assessment.
