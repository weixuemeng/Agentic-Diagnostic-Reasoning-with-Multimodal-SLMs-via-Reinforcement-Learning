                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is widening of the superior mediastinum, though this may be due to low
 lung volumes and portable technique.  Otherwise the lungs are clear with no
 evidence of a consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widening of the superior mediastium which may be due to low lung volumes and
 portable technique. However, if there is concern for aortic dissection or
 aneurysmal dilatation, a dedicated Chest CTA is recommended for further
 evaluation.  
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
