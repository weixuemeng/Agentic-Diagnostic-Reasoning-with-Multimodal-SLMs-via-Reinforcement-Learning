                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with myeloma and low-grade fever, on
 Velcade and dexamethasone.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is present.  Thoracic aorta is mildly elongated
 but otherwise unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 There are some plate densities in the right base consistent with peripheral
 atelectasis, but otherwise there is no evidence of any acute parenchymal
 infiltrate.  Pleural spaces are free.  As shown on previous chest
 examinations, there is diffuse demineralization of the vertebral bodies in the
 thoracic spine with compression fractures in the lower-most region involving
 T10, ___, and ___.  These skeletal changes, rather typical for multiple myeloma,
 appear unchanged.  Clearly on previous examination identified bilateral basal
 parenchymal infiltrates have cleared up, and the chest findings are now within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of chest findings.  No evidence of persistent
 pneumonia.  Stable bone changes in the thoracic spine as described.
