  The mediastinum appears somewhat widened however this may be due to
  projection. Examination is somewhat limited due to the patient's body habitus.
  Given that there may be a small left pleural effusion and left basal opacity
  consistent with compressive atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary
  edema. The right lung appears clear. Consider PA and lateral chest radiographs
  for further evaluation when clinically appropriate.

 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION:
