                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight gain and CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with no vascular congestion apparent.  This raises the
 possibility of pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.
 
 Calcifications overlying the cardiac shadow suggest coronary artery
 involvement.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen on the lateral view.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
