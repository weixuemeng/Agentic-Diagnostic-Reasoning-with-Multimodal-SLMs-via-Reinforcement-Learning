 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  There
 are very low lung volumes.  Some engorgement of pulmonary vessels could
 reflect mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure, accentuated by the poor
 inspiration.  Retrocardiac opacification suggests some atelectatic changes in
 the left lower lobe.
