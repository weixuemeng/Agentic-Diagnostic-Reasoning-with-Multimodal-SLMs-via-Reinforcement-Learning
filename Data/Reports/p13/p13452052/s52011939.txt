                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rib pain after fall; history of cirrhosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear aside from streaky basilar
 atelectasis.  On limited views, noting that this is not a complete rib series,
 and that lung volumes are low with soft tissue structures obscuring lower
 ribs, there is no definite evidence for rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence for injury or acute disease.
