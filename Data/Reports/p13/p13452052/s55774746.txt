                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  A lateral view is also included which shows that there is no pleural
 effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, ascites and liver failure.  Patient presents also with
 confusion did and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Lung volumes are low, which could be a reflection of ascites. 
 This includes mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which makes it
 difficult to exclude a subpulmonic effusion although no definite pleural
 effusions are demonstrated.  Streaky opacities at the left base suggests minor
 atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.  Low lung volumes which may reflect ascites and
 minor atelectasis at the left lung base.
