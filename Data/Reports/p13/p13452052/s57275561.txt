  1. Large right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
  
  2. Right perihilar opacity may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia could
  be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS, known cirrhosis.  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the study.  Interval development
 of a large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Left-sided
 pleural effusion is small, also with adjacent atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by asymmetrical right perihilar haziness.  Heart is
 top-normal in size.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Large right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
 
 2.  Right perihilar opacity may represent asymmetrical edema, although
 aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia are additional considerations. 
 Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for complete
 assessment of this finding when the patient's condition allows.
