  1.  Left internal jugular central venous line ends at the confluence of the
  left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
  
  2.  Stable right infrahilar opacity which remains concerning for malignancy
  and/or pneumonia.
  
  3. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension s/p CVL  // Eval LIJ line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___, and CT
 of the torso dated ___, performed after this study.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent opacity
 in the right infrahilar region silhouetting the right hilus and right heart
 border, unchanged from the prior study.  This is better assessed on CT of the
 torso performed after the study, and is consistent with a large right hilar
 mass. Streaky opacities at the right lung base appears slightly improved on
 this study, and again may represent atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Mediastinal contours remain
 prominent.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated.  No pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Left internal jugular central venous line ends at the
 confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  Endotracheal tube ends
 4.3 cm from the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central venous line ends at the confluence of the
 left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
 
 2.  Stable right infrahilar opacity consistent with infiltrative mass.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
