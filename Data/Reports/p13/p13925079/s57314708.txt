 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet
 approximately 6 cm above the carina. There is a U rounded opacity in the right
 infrahilar region silhouetting the right hilus and right heart border. There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Streaky
 opacities at the right lung base may reflect atelectasis. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The mediastinal contours are prominent,
 likely due in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette
 is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ETT terminating 6 cm above the carina.
 2. Right infrahilar opacity for malignancy and/or pneumonia.
 3. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
