 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of bronchiectasis, upper back pain, rule out pulmonary
 pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apical
 parenchymal opacities, partly fibrotic and partly consolidative, with
 elevation of the right hilus and likely related to the known history of TB,
 are completely unchanged.  Also completely unchanged is a small right
 apicolateral calcified granuloma.  The minimal changes in the left lung apex
 are also constant.  No additional parenchymal changes, notably no interval
 appearance of infectious lung pathologies.  Normal and unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
