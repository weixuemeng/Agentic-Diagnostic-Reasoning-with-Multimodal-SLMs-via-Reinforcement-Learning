                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right upper back pain radiating to front,
 evaluate for aortic root dilation or acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been no significant interval change to the right apical parenchymal
 opacities, partly fibrotic and partly consolidative, with elevation of the
 right hilus likely related to known history of TB.  Small right apical lateral
 calcified granuloma is also noted.  The left lung is grossly clear.  There is
 no new focal consolidation to suggest acute infectious pathology.  The cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There
 is no dilation of the aortic root.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Stable right apical parenchymal changes related to known history of TB.
