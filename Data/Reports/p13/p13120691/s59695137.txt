                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a prominent left cardiac fat pad as before.  A round
 lingular nodule is again suspicious for malignancy.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although a slight new blunting of posterior
 costophrenic sulci is noted, possibly due to minor atelectasis or trace
 pleural effusion on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace left-sided pleural effusion, without other
 significant change, including a persistent suspicious lingular lung nodule.
