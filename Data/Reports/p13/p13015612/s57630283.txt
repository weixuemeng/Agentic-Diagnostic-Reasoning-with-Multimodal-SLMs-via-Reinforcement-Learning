                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pain and pancreatitis.  Rule out
 dissection from an EGD last week.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Specifically, no mediastinal air is noted. 
 Please note, however, that if esophageal perforation remains a clinical
 concern, then an esophagram is the study of choice, whereas if an aortic
 dissection is the clinical concern then a CT may be obtained.
