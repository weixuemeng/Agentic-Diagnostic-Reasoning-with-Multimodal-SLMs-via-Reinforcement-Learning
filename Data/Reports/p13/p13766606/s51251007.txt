 please Surg: ___ (TAVR)     pre operative eval please
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is mild
 prominence of interstitial markings at the bases, which could reflect chronic
 pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both. No evidence of
 vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 Areas of lucency air seen beneath the hemidiaphragms.  This is consistent with
 the appearance on the recent CT scan and would not suggest free
 intraperitoneal gas and less there are appropriate clinical symptoms.
