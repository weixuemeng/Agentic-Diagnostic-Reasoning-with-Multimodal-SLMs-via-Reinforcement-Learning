                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Headache and dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region could reflect
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Infection cannot be completely excluded.
