                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Lung volumes are
 low and evaluation is limited due to kyphotic deformity of the T-spine.  There
 is mild pulmonary edema.  Deformity of the left fifth, sixth, and seventh
 posterior ribs are of unclear chronicity.  No pneumothorax or large effusion
 is seen.  Given the low lung volumes, the possibility of a lower lobe
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The heart and mediastinal contour are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.  Left 5, 6, and seventh rib deformities, may
 represent acute fractures in the correct clinical setting.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
