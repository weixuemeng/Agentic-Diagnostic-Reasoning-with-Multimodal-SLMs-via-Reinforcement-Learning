                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Leftward shift of mediastinal structures with tenting of the left
 hemidiaphragm is compatible with left sided volume loss as a result of prior
 left upper lobectomy.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely reflects a small left pleural effusion.  Atelectatic
 changes are noted in the left lung base.  Right lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine with anterior osteophytes.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are
 present 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postsurgical changes in the left lung.  Small left pleural effusion and left
 basilar atelectasis.
