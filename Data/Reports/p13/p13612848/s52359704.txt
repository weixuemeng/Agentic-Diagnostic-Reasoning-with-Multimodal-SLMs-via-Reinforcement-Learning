                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for an acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from ___.  Chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low with bibasilar linear opacities, which are
 most likely atelectasis.  There is mild pulmonary edema with trace pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 The heart is enlarged, though not significantly changed from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild edema and trace pleural effusions.
 2.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Bibasilar opacities in the setting of low lung volumes, likely represent
 atelectasis.
