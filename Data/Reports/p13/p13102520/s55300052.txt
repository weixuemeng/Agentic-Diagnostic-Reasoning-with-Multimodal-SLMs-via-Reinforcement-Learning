                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  The heart size is top normal, exaggerated
 by low lung volumes.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Pulmonary vascular
 markings are indistinct, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  No substantial
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky linear retrocardiac left base
 opacity most likely represents atelectasis/scarring rather than consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema without substantial pleural effusion. Streaky linear
 retrocardiac left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis/scarring
 rather than consolidation.
