 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains moderately enlarged.  There is widening of the
 mediastinal contour, increased from prior, with a calcified aorta.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities
 most likely reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased medistinal widening for which chest CTA is recommended for further
 assessment. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable bibasilar
 atelectasis.
