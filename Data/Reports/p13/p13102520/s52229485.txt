                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, CHF.  Evaluate volume overload,
 location of ET tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube terminates 3.3 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm; however, the tip is not included in this
 examination.  Right IJ venous catheter terminates at least at the mid SVC.
 Large cardiomegaly remains unchanged.  Persistent presumably mild pulmonary
 edema with vascular engorgement. Persistent opacification of the right lung
 base could be related to moderate amount of pleural fluid, however underlying
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of continued cardiac decompensation.
