                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:40.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inferior thorax is not included on the image.  There has been
 interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 2.9 cm
 above the level of the carina.  There is persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema appears slightly increased.  There is left mid lung linear
 atelectasis/scarring.  Previously noted relative more confluent opacity at the
 right lung base is not fully imaged on the current study.  There appears to
 possibly be left retrocardiac opacity, although this is not fully imaged.
