                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.  Question infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.  CT dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right pectoral
 Port-A-Catheter with tip terminating in the lower SVC or upper atrium. 
 Multiple pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on prior cross-sectional
 studies.  A dominant left hilar mass has begun to grow after earlier
 remission.  Worse left hemidiaphragm elevation is explained by phrenic nerve
 impingement.  There is no confluent consolidation, pneumothorax, or large
 pleural effusion.  Prominent epicardial fat pad likely contributes to slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence for acute infection.
 2.  Growing left suprahilar mass and growing right lung nodules due to
 progressive metastatic lung cancer; probable left phrenic nerve dysfunction.
 3.  Right sided central infusion port ends at the superior cavoatrial junction
 as before.
