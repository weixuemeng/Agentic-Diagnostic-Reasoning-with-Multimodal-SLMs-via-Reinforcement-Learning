                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  S/p left central line placement, assessment for
 complications.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Portable AP radiograph was reviewed.
 
 No definitive evidence of pneumothorax is demonstrated on the left as well as
 on the right.  The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  Port-A-Cath catheter
 tip inserted through the right subclavian approach terminates at the level of
 cavoatrial junction/right atrium.  No change in mediastinal contour is
 demonstrated.  Left basal atelectasis is noted.  Multiple pulmonary nodules
 are better seen on CT, although still can be seen on the current radiograph.
