                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 6 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube heads into the stomach although its
 tip lies beyond the confines of the film.  A right internal jugular central
 venous catheter again terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is probably a
 small pleural effusion on the right, although not necessarily changed.  A
 diffuse interstitial abnormality is increased suggesting pulmonary edema.  In
 addition, there are nodular opacities and a possible developing focal opacity
 in the right lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pulmonary edema, but also with possible nodules and
 developing opacity at the right base, which if confirmed could represent
 developing pneumonia aspiration or atelectasis.  Follow-up chest radiograph
 are recommended.
