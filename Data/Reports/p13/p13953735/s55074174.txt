                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of traumatic
 pneumothorax on the left.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 Currently, the left chest tube is in place with subcutaneous air which appears
 to be slightly increased, but no definitive pneumothorax seen on the left.  On
 the right, there is a large skin fold demonstrated with its being unlikely to
 represent the pneumothorax.  To confirm that, repeated radiograph is
 recommended after removal of all the potential skinfolds.  Small amount of
 right pleural effusion is noted, most likely unchanged as compared to the
 prior study.
