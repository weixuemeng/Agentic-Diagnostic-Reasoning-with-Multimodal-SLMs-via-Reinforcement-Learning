                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Worsening respiratory distress.  Evaluate for new
 infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Evaluation of the lung fields is limited
 due to respiratory motion.  The right lung is well aerated.  New increased
 perihilar opacity and peribronchial cuffing in the left perihilar region is
 consistent with interval development of heart failure.  Retrocardiac opacities
 are compatible with the known hiatal hernia.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax are identified.  The heart size is difficult to determine, but
 likely mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified. Eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New peribronchial cuffing and perihilar opacity are consistent
 with interval development of heart failure.
