                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Black eye, pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 persistent elevation and eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.  Retrocardiac
 density with larger air-fluid level is consistent with a large hiatal hernia. 
 Right paratracheal opacity is stable and may represent prominent vascular
 structures.  No definite new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 There is persistent moderate-to-severe compression of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent elevation/eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Evidence of large hiatal hernia.
 
 Persistent moderate-to-severe compression of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
