                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right central catheter with
 the tip in the upper SVC and the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in
 proper position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Bilateral
 layering pleural effusions are noted. Given the change in patient position, it
 is difficult to tell if these effusions are new or increased. The area of
 pneumonia is substantially covered by the layering fluid and difficult to
 evaluate. There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral layering pleural effusions; it is difficult to tell if these are
 new or increased, versus unchanged and more prominent due to change in
 position. 
 
 2. The area of pneumonia is substantially covered by layering fluid, making it
 difficult to evaluate for interval change. 
 
 Upright and/or lateral views, if possible, would be helpful with evaluation.
