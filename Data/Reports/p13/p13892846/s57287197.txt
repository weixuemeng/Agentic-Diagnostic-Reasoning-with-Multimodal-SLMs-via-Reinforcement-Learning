                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute on chronic chronic SDH  // assess
 Lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is again seen in ET tube which terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. An
 enteric tube is seen with distal tip in the stomach.
 
 There is rightward rotation on the current radiograph.  Allowing for changes
 due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 There is increased interstitial prominence, and increased prominence of
 pulmonary vasculature with more indistinct margins, likely representing
 worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 There is new bibasilar linear atelectasis.  In the left upper lung, there are
 what appears to be pleural-based calcifications; it is recommended to
 correlate with previous studies if available.  If not, it is recommended to
 obtain non-emergent chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 There are no pneumothoraces or effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increasing pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema.
 2.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
 3.  Stable position of ET tube and enteric tube.
 4.  Possible left upper lung pleural-based calcifications. Correlate with
 prior radiographs. If prior radiographs are not available, we recommend
 non-emergent chest CT for further evaluation.
