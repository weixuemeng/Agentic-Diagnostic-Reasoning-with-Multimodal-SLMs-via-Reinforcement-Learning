                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated, transfer from outside institution
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.2 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach. Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal. Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  The lung apices are excluded from the field of view and
 therefore assessment for a pneumothorax is limited. No pleural effusion is
 identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Exclusion of the lung apices from this exam.
 3. Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflective of atelectasis.
