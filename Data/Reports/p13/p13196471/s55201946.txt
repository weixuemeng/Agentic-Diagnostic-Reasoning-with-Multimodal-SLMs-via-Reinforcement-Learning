                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with multiple rib fractures and pneumothorax. 
 Assess extent of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT and radiograph from___ earlier the same date.
 
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  No definite pneumothorax is seen
 on these films, suggesting that the pneumothorax previously seen is small and
 has not increased from previous examination. A suggestion of a pleural line in
 the right apex would reflect at most a small apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is seen with low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion is identified.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Please see the CT for better
 assessment of the fractures.
