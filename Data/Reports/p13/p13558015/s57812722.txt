                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of AICD firing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  A left-sided
 AICD is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus lead is
 possibly very minimally deeper in position when it is compared to the prior
 study.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Partially imaged is
 the inferior aspect of metallic cervical spine hardware.
