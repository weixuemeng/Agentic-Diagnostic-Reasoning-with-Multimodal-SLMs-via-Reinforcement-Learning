  Tip of the right Port-A-Cath terminates near the cavoatrial junction.
  
  Pulmonary edema is at least moderately severe.  However, since the prior chest
  radiograph performed 1 day earlier, opacities in the medial upper lobes have
  increased, which may represent worsening edema or multifocal infection.  No
  pneumothorax.  Probable tiny bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pnia  // eval status of pnia/fluid
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion and moderate ___ severe edema persists.  A more confluent
 asymmetrical focus of airspace disease in the right infrahilar region is
 concerning for superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Small right pleural effusion is again demonstrated.
