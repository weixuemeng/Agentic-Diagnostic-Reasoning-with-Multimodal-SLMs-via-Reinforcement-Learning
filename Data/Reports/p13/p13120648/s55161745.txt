 ?worsening edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 20:59
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath and left PICC line remain in place.  Interval removal
 of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.  There is increasing opacity
 throughout both lungs which likely represents superimposed pulmonary edema on
 a chronic airspace process which relatively spares a portion of the left lower
 lobe.  Moderate right effusion.  Mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due
 to patient positioning and obscuration by the airspace process.  No
 pneumothorax.
