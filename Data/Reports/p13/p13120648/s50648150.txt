                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypxoia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, right worse than left. 
 Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles is noted, potentially in part due
 to overlying soft tissues although small effusions are possible.  Cardiac
 silhouette is difficult to assess on background of parenchymal opacities. 
 Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip projecting over the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, right worse than left.  This could be
 due to edema, bilateral infection versus ARDS.  Followup after treatment
 suggested.
