                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of hypoxia, respiratory distress.  Please evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen, increased compared to the
 prior exam, right greater than left with blunting of the right costophrenic
 angles, likely secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. 
 The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess on the background of the
 parenchymal opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, which may be
 secondary to edema, infection or with ARDS.
