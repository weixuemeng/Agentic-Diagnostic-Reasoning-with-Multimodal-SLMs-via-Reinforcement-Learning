                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old woman with fever and cough, evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal in size, possibly mildly enlarged. The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable. Diffuse interstitial prominence likely relates to
 bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes and a sub-optimal
 inspiratory effort. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
