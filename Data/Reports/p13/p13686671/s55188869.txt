                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with alcohol withdrawal status post intubation. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiographs performed ___ and ___ at ___.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 passes into the distended stomach, tip off the inferior margin of the film.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Even accounting for this, there is cardiomegaly that
 appears worsened from one day prior.  Additionally, there is widening of the
 vascular pedicle, compatible with central vascular congestion, as well as
 small right and possible left pleural effusion.  In this setting, and given
 the relative normal appearance of the lungs on recent comparison studies,
 diffuse parenchymal opacities most likely reflect pulmonary edema.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There is no free air is seen in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Adequate positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. 
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly, small effusions, and moderate pulmonary edema are new from
 one day prior, all suggesting overhydration.
