 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT placement  // placement      placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the enteric tube coils in
 the mid to lower esophagus so that the tip lies at about the level of the
 thoracic inlet.  The Dobbhoff tube extends at least to the second portion of
 the duodenum where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
 The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
