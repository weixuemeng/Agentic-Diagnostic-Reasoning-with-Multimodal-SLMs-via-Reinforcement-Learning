                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p intubation ___ to aspiration pna  //
 eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 06:43
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, right subclavian PICC line and right internal
 jugular central line are unchanged.  Persistent low lung volumes with layering
 bilateral effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities consistent with partial
 lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration could also have this
 appearance.  Overall, there is no significant interval change.  No pulmonary
 edema or obvious pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 stable given differences in positioning and inspiration.
