                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with h/o HTN, ESRD s/p LURT renal tx in ___ on tacro/MMF,
 initially admitted for DKA, acute pancreatitis ___ triglycerides, ___ on CKD,
 c/b partial SMV thrombosis near occlusion of splenic vein, hemorraghic ascites
 with anticoagulation, and enterococcal bacteremia, admitted to MICU for
 hypoxemic respiratory failure ___ aspiration event, and hypotension concerning
 for septic shock on levophed.  // interval assessment and for NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm.  The
 configuration suggests that the NG tube is looped, probably within the
 stomach, with the extreme tip crossing itself to lie beneath the left
 hemidiaphragm, likely within the upper gastric fundus.
 
 The previously seen enteric tube is no longer visualized.
 
 The ET tube tip lies at the level of the lower clavicular heads, approximately
 6.1 cm above the carina.  A right IJ central line tip overlies the
 proximal/mid SVC.  A left IJ central line lies near the tip of the proximal
 SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary findings are similar to ___ at 04:06
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube passes below the diaphragm and likely loops within the stomach, with
 tip overlying the upper most gastric fundus.  The previously seen enteric tube
 has been removed.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
