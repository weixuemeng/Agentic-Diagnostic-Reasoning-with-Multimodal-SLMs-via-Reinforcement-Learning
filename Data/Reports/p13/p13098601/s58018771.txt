                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatitis  // intubated
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube approximately 6.8 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip over stomach. 
 Enteric type tube extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Right IJ central
 line over proximal SVC.  Left IJ central line near confluence of left
 innominate and right subclavian vessels.  No pneumothorax is detected .
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Hazy density at both lung
 bases could reflect presence of small layering effusions.  There is underlying
 bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and mild diffuse vascular blurring consistent with CHF.  This may be very
 slightly improved compared with the prior film as the confluent opacity in
 left mid zone is less apparent.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings similar to the prior study from ___ at 04:02 a.m.. 
 Possible slight interval improvement in CHF findings.
