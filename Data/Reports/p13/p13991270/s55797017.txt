                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Bradycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  The lung volumes are low.  Patchy opacity
 obscuring the left costophrenic angle is probably due to atelectasis rather
 than pneumonia or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Pulmonary
 vessels are relatively enlarged but well defined, perhaps with upper zone
 re-distribution, although probably unchanged and suggesting at most mild
 venous hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
