                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD, HTN, b/l pleural effusions p/w dyspnea
 // ?acute interval changes      ?acute interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the large left pleural effusion
 with underlying compressive atelectasis is unchanged.  Some hazy opacification
 at the right base is most likely reflecting a layering pleural effusion with
 some atelectatic changes.
 The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess but is probably enlarged.  There
 is increased indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 increase in the degree of pulmonary edema.
