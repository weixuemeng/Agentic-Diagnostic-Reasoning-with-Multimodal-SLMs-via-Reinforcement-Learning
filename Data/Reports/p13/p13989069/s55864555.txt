                                 FINAL REPORT
 
 
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The true heart size is difficult to assess as the patient has considerable
 mediastinal fat pads obscuring left apical heart area as well as the right
 cardiomediastinal angle.  True cardiac enlargement is unlikely as there is no
 evidence of any pulmonary vascular congestion.  Thoracic aorta is
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Moderate degree of
 degenerative changes is seen in the thoracic spine in the form of osteophytic
 bridging prominences at the vertebral bodies, anterior and lateral contours. 
 There is, however, no evidence of any vertebral body compression.  In
 comparison with the next previous chest examination of ___, no
 evidence of increasing heart size, pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates. 
 Noticed, however, by comparison is the progression of the mediastinal fat pads
 that obscure the heart shadows.
