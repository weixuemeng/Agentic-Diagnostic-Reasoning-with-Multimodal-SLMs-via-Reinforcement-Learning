                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lymph nodes on prior chest CT.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and CT of the chest, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is volume loss of the right hemithorax, status post right lower
 lobectomy.  There is mild scarring at the right lung base, with blunting of
 the costophrenic sulcus.  Diaphragms also appear flattened on the lateral
 view, suggesting underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is
 no parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are essentially
 unremarkable.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes and prominent pulmonary arteries
 are better evaluated on recent CT and not well seen radiographically.  There
 is moderate thoracic spondylosis.  No acute compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Postoperative change in the right hemithorax status post right
 lower lobectomy with underlying chronic obstruction pulmonary disease.  Small
 mediastinal lymph nodes and prominent pulmonary arteries were better evaluated
 on recent CT.  No radiographically apparent acute process.
