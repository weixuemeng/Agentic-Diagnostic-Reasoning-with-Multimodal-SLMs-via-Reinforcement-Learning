                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, NSCLC s/p resection in ___, follicular
 lymphoma p/w fever, cough  // pneumonia, adenopathy, mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chronic appearing changes are noted at the right lung with chronic volume
 loss.  There is chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be
 due to small pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  Subtle increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to minimal interstitial edema
 superimposed on COPD.  No lobar consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic volume loss of the right lung compared to the left.  Chronic blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle, trace pleural effusion versus pleural
 thickening.
 
 Subtle increase in interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally may be due to
 minimal interstitial edema superimposed on COPD.  No lobar consolidation.  If
 high clinical concern for mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, CT is more
 sensitive and should be considered.
