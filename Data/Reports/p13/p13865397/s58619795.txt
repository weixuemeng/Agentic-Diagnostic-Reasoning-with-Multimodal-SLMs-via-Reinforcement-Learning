                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD exacerbation.  Questionable
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains within normal
 limits.  Unchanged presentation of thoracic aorta, which is mildly widened and
 elongated but without local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  Irregular distribution of the pulmonary vessels in the
 periphery is consistent with COPD.  Furthermore, one can identify the surgical
 clips in the lower portion of the right hilum as the patient is status post
 right lower lobectomy in the past.  Mild degree of pleural adhesion on the
 right lung base, but no evidence of pleural effusion as the posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  Comparison with the next preceding examination does not
 disclose the presence of new acute infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged status compatible with COPD but no evidence of new
 acute discrete pulmonary infiltrates during this phase of suspicious
 exacerbation.
