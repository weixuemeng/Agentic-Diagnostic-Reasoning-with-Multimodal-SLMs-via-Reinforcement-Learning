                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and shortness of breath  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as well as
 CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly low lung volumes. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Increased opacity
 projecting over a lower thoracic vertebral body on lateral view likely
 corresponds to increased opacity in the region of the right heart border. 
 Allowing for differences in inspiratory phase, this likely corresponds to a
 right upper lobe pneumonia seen on CT from ___.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Right hilar clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia, similar to CT from ___.
