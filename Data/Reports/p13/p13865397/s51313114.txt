                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post segmentectomy procedure in the right
 lower lobe for previous history of lung cancer.  Surgical clips are present in
 the right infrahilar region with associated expected volume loss and scarring
 in this region.  New since prior postoperative radiographs are poorly defined,
 relatively symmetrical nodular opacities in the periphery of the lower lobes
 just above the diaphragm level.  Otherwise, the appearance of the lungs and
 pleura are similar to the prior postoperative chest radiographs. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  No acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar poorly defined nodular opacities, possibly due to an
 atypical radiographic appearance of nipple shadows. The differential diagnosis
 includes focal infectious pneumonia.  
 
 Followup chest radiographs with nipple markers would be helpful in this
 regard.  Information has been entered into the radiology communications
 dashboard on ___ with the above recommendation.
