                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe acute chest pain radiating to the back 
 
 COMPARISON:  None available 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal chest radiographs demonstrate well expanded lungs.  Heart appears
 mildly enlarged.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Chest radiograph is not sensitive for detection of pulmonary embolism or
 aortic dissection and CTA should be considered if there is high clinical
 suspicion.
