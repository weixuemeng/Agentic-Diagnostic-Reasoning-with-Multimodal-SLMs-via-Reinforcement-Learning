                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal image of the chest.  Retrocardiac opacity, possibly
 representing atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the
 right clinical setting.  The left costophrenic angle not well visualized,
 likely representing a small pleural effusion.  The lungs are otherwise
 hyperexpanded but clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Retrocardiac opacity and a probable small left pleural effusion.  Findings
 could represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the
 right clinical setting.
