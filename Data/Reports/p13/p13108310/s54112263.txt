                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient has lung hyperinflation compatible with COPD.  Mild pulmonary vessel
 cephalization with new minimal bilateral pleural effusion is compatible with
 new pulmonary edema.  The heart contour is mildly enlarged and unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities are also new and could be
 compatible with dependent edema, infectious process, or aspiration or even
 atelectasis.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema is new.
 2.  New bibasilar opacities could be dependent edema, atelectasis, aspiration,
 or pneumonia in appropriate clinical settings.
