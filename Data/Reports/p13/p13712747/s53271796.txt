                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, rales at the lung
 bases, evaluate for pneumonia or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  The
 bilateral hila are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.  Subtle opacity at the
 right cardiophrenic angle is most compatible with crowding of bronchovascular
 structures and/or mild atelectasis in the setting of a suboptimal inspiratory
 effort.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
