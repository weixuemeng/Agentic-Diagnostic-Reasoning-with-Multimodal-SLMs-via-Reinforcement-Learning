 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:42 PM
  Interval development of patchy right sided opacity which may reflect
  asymmetric pulmonary edema though accompanying pneumonia may also be present.
  Increased density of left basal opacity is likely at least in part atelectasis
  but again pneumonia remains possible particularly given the clinical history.
  PICC is in satisfactory position with pacer/ICD leads and moderate to severe
  cardiomegaly unchanged. Low lung volumes and accompanying pulmonary edema
  limit evaluation. ___ d/w ___-___ at ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, multiple ICD shocks.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pacemaker leads are in standard
 position.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There has been interval worsening of moderate
 pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities.  Bibasilar opacities could be due to
 a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions, larger on the left
 side, though superimposed pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. Asymmetric
 opacity at the periphery of the right upper lobe, is also worrisome for
 pneumonia.
