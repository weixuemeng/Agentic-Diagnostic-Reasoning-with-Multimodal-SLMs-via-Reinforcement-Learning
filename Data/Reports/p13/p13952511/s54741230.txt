                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ as well as PICC placement report
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  A PICC line has been
 retracted and now terminates over the right brachiocephalic vein, probably at
 the point where it separates into subclavian and right internal jugular veins.
 There are patchy opacities at both lung bases most compatible with
 atelectasis, noting low lung volumes.  Streaky right basilar atelectasis
 persists.  Mild increased interstitial opacification and perihilar fullness
 suggest mild vascular congestion.  There is no definite pleural effusion,
 although the left lateral lower chest is obscured by the pacemaker device,
 making one difficult to exclude.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.  
 
 2.  Interval retraction of right-sided PICC line, now terminating likely at
 the confluence of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins.
