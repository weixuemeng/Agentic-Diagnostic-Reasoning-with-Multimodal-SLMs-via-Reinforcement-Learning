                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status, dyspnea and abdominal
 pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Lung volumes are again noted which could accentuate
 the pulmonary bronchovascular markings.  There are indistinct pulmonary
 vascular markings raising possibility of underlying edema.  There is no large
 effusion or large confluent consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable in configuration.  Triple-lead pacing device is again seen with lead
 tips within the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. 
 Compression deformities in the mid-to-lower thoracic spine are noted similar
 to prior chest x-ray from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.  No new
 confluent consolidation.
