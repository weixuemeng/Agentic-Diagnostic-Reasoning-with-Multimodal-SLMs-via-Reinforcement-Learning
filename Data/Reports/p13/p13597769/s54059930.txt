                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tightness and bilateral leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a moderate new pleural effusion on the right.  A small to moderate
 pleural effusion is new on the left.  In each case, there are patchy
 associated opacities, not specific but compatible with atelectasis. 
 Associated infection cannot be excluded, however, although pleural effusions
 are seen most likely to represent the primary abnormality.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Substantial bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 opacities, probably attributable atelectasis; an infectious process is
 difficult to completely exclude, however.
