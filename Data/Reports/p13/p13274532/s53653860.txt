                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and wheeze. ?pneumonia or pulm edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, of ___, ___, ___, and ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly smaller with unchanged calcification of the
 aortic knob.  Compared with the prior radiograph, the pulmonary edema has
 improved, if not completely resolved. The severity of pulmonary vascular
 congestion is improved, with a persistent left pleural effusion. Greater
 opacification of the right lower lobe is apparent. However, prior episodes of
 asymmetric pulmonary edema have shown collection is specifically in the right
 lower lobe. Therefore while pneumonia cannot be excluded, we do not have to
 invoke its presence to explain these findings. A fractured, undisplaced
 sternal wire is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Improved pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Greater opacification of the right lower lobe correlates with prior
 episodes of asymmetric pulmonary edema in this region.  Therefore, while
 pneumonia cannot be excluded, this pattern can be used it explain these
 findings.
