                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including
 evidence for prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mild cardiomegaly.
 Dishiscence of the third highest sternal wire appears unchanged. Small pleural
 effusions are difficult to exclude.  In addition to mild vascular congestion,
 which appears unchanged, there are patchy increased opacities at the lung
 bases.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded although these may be seen with volume
 loss and atelectasis.  Lung volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases, although greater on the left than
 right.  Although pneumonia is not excluded by this examination, findings could
 also be seen with atelectasis.
