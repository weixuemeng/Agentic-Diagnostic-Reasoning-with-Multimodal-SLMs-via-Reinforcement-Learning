                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of dizziness, now with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  Central pulmonary vascularity is prominent, with upper zone
 redistribution and indistinct appearance suggesting mild vascular congestion. 
 In addition, there is a widespread new focal opacity projecting over the right
 lower lung, obscuring the right heart border and likely within the right
 middle lobe.  There are also streaky left infrahilar opacities with air
 bronchograms. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacities, right greater than left, worrisome for
 pneumonia, noting that these are fairly focal and confluent.  Background
 increased pulmonary vascular congestion is also suggested by diffuse vascular
 prominence and indistinctness, however.
