                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough for two days, now with low
 oxygen saturation, evaluate for pneumonia versus consolidation/collection of
 pleural effusion versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  There is status post sternotomy.  Multiple surgical clips
 in the left-sided mediastinal structures are indicative of previous bypass
 surgery.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  Thoracic aorta is of ordinary
 ___ but rather elongated and shows advanced walled calcifications at
 the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature shows an upper zone
 re-distribution pattern.  No evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.  No
 acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified, and the lateral pleural
 sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Comparison is made with the
 next preceding chest examination obtained ___ month ago.  Cardiovascular
 findings are grossly unchanged; however, bilateral basal patchy parenchyma on
 the bases indicated the presence of bronchopneumonic infiltrates.  These
 parenchymal changes are not present anymore.
 
 IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiac enlargement with evidence of mild degree of
 chronic pulmonary congestion status post bypass surgery.  No evidence of acute
 parenchymal infiltrates or pleural effusion as can be identified on single AP
 chest view.
