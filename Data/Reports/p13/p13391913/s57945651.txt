                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with wheezing on left base.  Evaluate
 for any possible pulmonary abnormalities on the left lung base.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size appears at the upper limit of
 normal variation.  There is a relative prominence of the left ventricular
 contour to the left posteriorly, but there is no sign of left atrial
 enlargement.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated, but does
 not demonstrate any local contour abnormality.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No
 pneumothorax in apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.  When comparison is made with the next preceding chest
 examination of ___, findings are unchanged.  General widening of
 the thoracic aorta, absence of significant cardiac enlargement or pulmonary
 congestion existed already at that time.
