                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p thoracoabdominal esophagectomy and a
 eshopagojejnostomy  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 NG type tube and left chest tube remain visible.  The tip of the NG tube lies
 at the level of the GE junction, probably just above it.  A side-port, if
 present, overlies the lower esophagus.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  Patchy opacity in the
 right cardiophrenic region is more pronounced, but could reflect the presence
 of the neo esophagus.  The possibility of some associated atelectasis cannot
 be excluded.  Retro cardiac opacity is very slightly more pronounced than on
 the prior study.
 
 Extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  Small effusions
 would be difficult to exclude, but no gross effusion is identified.
 
 Possible extremely tiny left apical pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube lies proximal to the level of the GE junction.  Clinical correlation
 requested.
 
 Changes in the right cardiophrenic region could relate to the esophageal
 surgery.  Bibasilar atelectasis is likely present, with slight interval
 progression at the left base.
 
 No overt CHF or gross effusion.
 
 Tiny left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
