                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with AML receiving induction chemotherapy, now
 with severe cough and question of volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates an increase in right
 perihilar vascular opacity, likely reflecting an increase in vascular
 congestion or possibly a perihilar consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  There appears to be some interval obscuring of the left
 hemidiaphragm, which could be consistent with a retrocardiac atelectasis
 versus consolidation.  This would be better visualized on a lateral image. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged, although portions
 of the heart border are less clearly visualized on this exam due to adjacent
 opacities.  There has been interval placement of an NG tube, which is seen
 with the tip at least in the proximal stomach, though whether it continues to
 pass beyond this point is not clearly seen on this image.  A followup
 abdominal x-ray to verify the location and the tip of the NG tube is
 recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of right perihilar opacity that could be
 consistent with worsening vascular congestion or consolidation.  Possible
 development of a left lung base retrocardiac opacity, which could represent
 atelectasis or possibly consolidation.
