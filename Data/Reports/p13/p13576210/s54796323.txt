                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Febrile neutropenia with acute worsening of shortness of
 breath.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT.  Allowing the
 difference in technique, multifocal opacities with larger consolidation in the
 right lower lobe are grossly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Right upper lobe fibrosis is better
 evaluated in prior CT.
