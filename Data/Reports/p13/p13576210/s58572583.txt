 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fungal pneumonia and volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate substantial
 worsening in pulmonary vascular congestion since previous imaging.  There are
 small pleural effusions bilaterally and bibasilar atelectatic changes. 
 Lateral view demonstrates a spine sign indicating a retrocardiac opacity
 which, in the appropriate clinical setting, could represent pneumonia.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Retrocardiac opacity suspicious for pneumonia.
