                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT scan performed at___ the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  Left-sided pleural effusion is seen both
 clearing inferiorly and projecting over the mid to upper thoracic cavity.  The
 enlarged mediastinal contour is compatible with mediastinal, para-aortic
 hematoma identified on CT scan.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left-sided pleural effusion likely hemorrhagic as well as significant
 mediastinal hematoma, all better assessed on earlier CT scan and worrisome for
 aortic rupture.  
 
 Vascular team had already been aware of patient's diagnosis at time of
 interpretation.
