                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with aortic stenosis, dyspnea  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widespread bilateral interstitial opacities are new since the prior exam and
 consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. A small right pleural
 effusion is present with bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The heart size is mildly enlarged and
 there is calcification of the aortic knob. Right rib deformities are
 consistent with chronic fractures. Osseous structures are diffusely
 demineralized with multiple thoracic and lumbar spine compression deformities,
 of indeterminate age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small right pleural effusion.
 
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3. Multiple thoracolumbar spine compression deformities of indeterminate age.
