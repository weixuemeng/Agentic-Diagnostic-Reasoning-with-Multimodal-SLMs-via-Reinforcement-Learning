 HISTORY:  Seizures and respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric
 tube has been pushed forward so that tip lies at least in the lower body of
 the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image.  The endotracheal
 tube tip lies well above the clavicles, approximately 10 cm above the carina. 
 Right basilar consolidation persists.
