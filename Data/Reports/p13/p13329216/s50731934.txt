                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman with critical AS status post AVR.  Assess
 line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube, mediastinal drains/chest tube and Swan-Ganz
 catheter in satisfactory position.  Nasogastric tube terminates with tip just
 beyond the GE junction with sidehole in the distal esophagus.  The lungs are
 low in volume with likely mild pulmonary edema and trace right-sided pleural
 effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  Heart is top normal in size with
 postoperative mediastinal widening as expected.
 
 Rectangular lucency projecting over the upper abdomen is of uncertain
 significance and could reflect unusual projection of free intraperitoneal air
 or shadow created by external objects.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild pulmonary edema with nasogastric tube sidehole in the distal esophagus
 which can be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.  Findings were
 discussed with ___, NP, at 14:50, at the time of discovery by Dr.
 ___ by phone.
 
 2. Lucency in the upper abdomen could reflect intraperitoneal air or external
 objects, evaluation by left lateral decubitus radiograph to evaluate for
 intraperitoneal air is suggested. Finding was discussed with ___ ___,
 NP, at ___, 5 minutes after discovery by Dr. ___ on ___ by phone.
