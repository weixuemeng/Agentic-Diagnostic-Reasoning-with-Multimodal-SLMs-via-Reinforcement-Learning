                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated, and there is
 a large AP diameter to the chest, consistent with chronic obstructive lung
 disease.  Prominence of the perihilar vessels and vascular congestion is
 noted. Despite technique, the cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.    The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Dense
 calcifications are seen within the aortic arch.  Mild loss of height
 anteriorly of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.
