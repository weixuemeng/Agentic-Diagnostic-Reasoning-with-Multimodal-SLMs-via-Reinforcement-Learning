 HISTORY:  Fever.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Patchy ill-defined
 opacity is noted within the periphery of the left lower lobe.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in
 the thoracic spine.  Partially imaged is a inferior vena cava filter.

 Peripheral left lower lobe opacity is concerning for pneumonia.  Follow up
 radiographs are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
