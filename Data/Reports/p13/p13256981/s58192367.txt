                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post laparoscopic Nissen,
 hiatal hernia repair on ___, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient upright
 position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  The configuration suggests
 a left ventricular prominence to the left and posteriorly.  In addition, the
 thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated.  No local aortic abnormal
 contours are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No
 signs of acute infiltrates and the pleural spaces are free.  No pneumothorax
 in the apical area.  Skeletal structures grossly within normal limits.
 
 When comparison is made with the preceding portable chest examination of
 ___, the that time existing local chest wall emphysema in the
 lower neck area has resolved.  The previously present NG tube has been
 withdrawn.  The retrocardiac area appears now unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement mostly involving left ventricle. 
 Consider possibility of previous myocardial injury of the left ventricular
 wall or aortic valve incompetence.  Absence of significant pulmonary
 congestion.
