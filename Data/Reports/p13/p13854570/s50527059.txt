                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper sharp chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Increased interstitial opacities are
 noted predominantly within the lung bases, not significantly changed from
 prior, with an area of linear atelectasis noted in the right lower lobe.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings within the lung bases which
 appear relatively similar when compared to the prior study, and may reflect
 chronic changes.  Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
