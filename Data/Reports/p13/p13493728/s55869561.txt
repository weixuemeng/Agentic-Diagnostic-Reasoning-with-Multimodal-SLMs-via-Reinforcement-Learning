  1. Low lung volumes and AP technique exaggerate the already enlarged cardiac
  silhouette.  Further evaluation for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
  could be performed with PA technique and full inspiratory effort.  Underlying
  pericardial effusion not excluded.
  2.  Moderate size left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying
  consolidation not excluded.  .
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 5:53 PM
  1. Low lung volumes and AP technique exaggerate the already enlarged cardiac
  silhouette, which is likely grossly stable from prior.  Further evaluation for
  enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be performed with PA technique and
  full inspiratory effort.
  2.  Moderate size left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.

 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB aND ? pleural and pericardial effusion pls
 eval edema  // History: ___M with SOB aND ? pleural and pericardial effusion
 pls eval edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi upright technique and low lung volumes exaggerate the already
 enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Allowing for technique, cardiomediastinal
 contours appear grossly unchanged.  Opacity of the left lung base is most
 consistent with a combination of moderate size pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation not entirely excluded.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  No pneumothorax.  A pacemaker device is present.  Extensive
 degenerative changes are seen in the right glenohumeral joint.  The left
 glenohumeral joint is not well seen due to overlying pacemaker device.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and AP technique exaggerate the already enlarged cardiac
 silhouette.  Further evaluation for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 could be performed with PA technique and full inspiratory effort.  Underlying
 pericardial effusion not excluded.
 2.  Moderate size left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation not excluded.  .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Low lung volumes and AP technique exaggerate the already
 enlarged cardiac silhouette, which is likely grossly stable from prior. 
 Further evaluation for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be
 performed with PA technique and full inspiratory effort.
