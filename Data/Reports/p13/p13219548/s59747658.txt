 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly
 unfolded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Remainder of the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
