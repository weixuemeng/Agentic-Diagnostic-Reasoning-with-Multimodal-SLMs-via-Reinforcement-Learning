                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 basilar opacity seen posteriorly over the spine on the lateral view inferiorly
 may be due to atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
