                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with altered mental status  // Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Lung volumes are low.  There is retrocardiac opacity which
 partially silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  There is right basilar opacity,
 likely atelectasis.  Superiorly, lungs are grossly clear besides linear left
 mid lung likely atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is likely within normal
 limits but accentuated due to AP technique and low lung volumes.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
