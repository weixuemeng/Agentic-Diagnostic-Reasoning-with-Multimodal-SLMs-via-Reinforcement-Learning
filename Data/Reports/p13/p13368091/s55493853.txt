                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with delirium
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Cardiac silhouette size remains mild to
 moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively similar. 
 There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary edema
 noted, new in the interval.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 areas of atelectasis, but infection, particularly in the right lung base, is
 not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar atelectasis with
 infection in the right lung base not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
