                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female smoker with a cough for a month.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 There is some asymmetry of prominent nipple shadows.  At the upper outer
 quadrant of the right nipple is the suggestion of a second, 9-mm wide nodular
 opacity that could be a lung nodule.  Therefore, I recommended shallow oblique
 views with nipple markers to see if this is a genuine abnormality.  Lateral
 view shows a very prominent 3 mm wide nodule projecting over the pulmonary
 outflow tract, almost certainly a calcified granuloma.  There is no pneumonia
 or atelectasis, no pulmonary edema, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is normal.  Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure.
 
 Findings were posted to the online record of critical radiology findings for
 direct notification of the referring physician.
