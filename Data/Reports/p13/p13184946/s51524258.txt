                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with pleuritic chest pain  // evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal in size and appears minimally increased in size from
 the prior study, which may in part be due to differences in inspiration.  The
 mediastinal contours are mildly widened when compared to prior study .  Lung
 volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study. The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly low lung volumes. Clear lungs.  Cardiac size appears minimally
 increased from the prior examination, which may be due to decreases in
 inspiration however if there is clinical concern for mediastinal pathology or
 pericardial effusion, consider CT.
