 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are normal. A subtle opacity obscures the left cardiac border, could reflect
 an early infectious process.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle opacity overlying the left cardiac border could reflect an early
 infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting. Short interval
 followup is advised to document resolution.
