                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re- demonstrated linear opacity extending laterally from the left hilum, most
 consistent with atelectasis and/or scarring.  Patchy left base opacity has
 improved in the interval with small residua remaining.  The right lung base
 also appears improved.  Subtle reticular nodular opacities in the right mid
 lung, right perihilar region again seen, possibly related to small airways
 disease.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Prominence of the left
 hilum persists which could relate to underlying lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities improved in the interval with possible slight
 residual remaining.  Persistent reticular nodular subtle opacity the right
 midlung, perihilar region could be due to small airways disease.
 
 Again seen prominent left hilum could relate to underlying lymphadenopathy.
