                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, shortness of breath, and fever, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased density in the right hilar region and streaky
 opacification at the right lung base.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  Eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The left lung is
 relatively clear with minimal atelectasis.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and left hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right hilar opacity, potentially enlarged pulmonary
 artery, adenopathay or technical.  Subtle right basilar opacity may represent
 a atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  PA and lateral suggested when patient
 is amenable.
