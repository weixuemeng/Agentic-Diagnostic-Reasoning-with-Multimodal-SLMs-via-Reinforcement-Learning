                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AVR.  Status post chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, 11:25 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior study, ET tube, NG tube and Swan-Ganz catheter have
 been removed.  The chest tube and mediastinal drain have also been removed. 
 Tubing over the right upper quadrant lies below the inferior edge of these
 films.  
 
 There is an equivocal tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Possible slight upper
 zone re-distribution, but no overt CHF.  Bibasilar patchy opacities similar to
 the prior film, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal
 blunting of left costophrenic angle is probably also without gross change.  
 
 There is a vague focal opacity at the right base laterally overlying the
 seventh rib.  This lies at the site of the chest tube and could represent
 small associated area of pulmonary contusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of right chest tube, with suspected tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.  
 
 2. New small focal opacity at the right lung base laterally could represent
 some residual pulmonary parenchymal change at the chest tube site. Attention
 to this area on followup films is requested.
