                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Apparent opacity at the right heart border on the frontal view
 without a correlate on the lateral view is due to pectus excavatum of the
 chest.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  No osseous abnormality is identified.  There is no free air under the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
