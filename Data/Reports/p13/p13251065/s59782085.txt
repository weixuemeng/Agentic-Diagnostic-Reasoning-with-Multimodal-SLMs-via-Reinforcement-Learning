                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT
 torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with known history of right pleural
 effusion status post multiple drainages, with temperature to 102, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A prominent
 epicardial fat pad accounts for the effacement of the left heart border. 
 There is mild blunting of the right CP angle which could reflect a tiny
 effusion or pleural thickening.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia or
 CHF.  Overall, heart size appears stable and within normal limits. 
 Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting at the right CP angle likely indicates a tiny effusion
 or pleural thickening.  No signs of pneumonia or CHF.
