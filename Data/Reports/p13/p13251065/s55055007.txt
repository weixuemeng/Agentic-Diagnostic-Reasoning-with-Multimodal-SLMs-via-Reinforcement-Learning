                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Left PICC has been removed.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm persists.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Patchy
 opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not
 excluded.  Linear opacities in the left mid lung field likely reflects
 scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
