 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right sided porta-cath is seen, distal aspect not well seen but
 likely terminating in the right atrium/cavoatrial junction.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is right middle lobe opacity worrisome for
 pneumonia.  Subtle left perihilar opacity is seen, which could be due to
 additional site of infection versus mild fluid overload.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  Left
 perihilar opacity which could be due to mild edema versus additional site of
 infection.
