                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:08 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man, postop day 7 after Whipple procedure with new chest
 pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has been extubated but lung volumes remain quite low, presumably due
 to bibasilar atelectasis, a nonspecific finding that can be seen with but is
 not diagnostic of pulmonary embolism.  Small right pleural effusion is
 presumed.  The heart size top normal, unchanged.  Minimal engorgement of
 mediastinal veins suggests some mild elevation of central venous pressure. 
 Left subclavian line ends in mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:50 a.m., at the time the findings were recognized.
