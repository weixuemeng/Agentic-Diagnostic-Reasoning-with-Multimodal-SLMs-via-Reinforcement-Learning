                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cholangitis, question evidence of infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
  An NG-type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. 
 Indwelling right subclavian catheter is present, tip over right atrium,
 unchanged.  
 
 Lordotic positioning with low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone
 redistribution, more pronounced than on the prior.  There is new increased
 retrocardiac density as well as some hazy opacity at the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Probable mild CHF.  
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  
 3) Hazy opacity at right base could reflect some layering pleural fluid.  
 4) If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to further characterize
 these findings.
