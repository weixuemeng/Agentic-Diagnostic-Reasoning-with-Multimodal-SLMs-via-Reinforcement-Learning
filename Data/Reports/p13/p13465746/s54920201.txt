                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath with known chest mass.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is biapical scarring and mild atelectasis, with superior
 retraction of the minor fissure due to right upper lobe volume loss, all of
 which is similar in appearance compared to prior CT from ___. 
 Tenting of the left hemidiaphragm relates to left lung volume loss and
 associated upward tension on the inferior ligament.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  The heart is normal in size.  Bulging of the left superior
 mediastinal contour with associated rightward displacement of the trachea is
 secondary to a known mediastinal mass, better evaluated on prior CT from ___.  The only change is reduced left apical thickening suggesting
 decreased pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 3.  Mediastinal mass, fully evaluated on recent CT from ___.
