                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Neutropenic fever and shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates in the expected location of the right
 atrium, unchanged.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Reduction in the
 upper lobe volume appears to be unchanged as compared to prior studies.  No
 new consolidations to suggest interval development of infectious process or
 pleural effusion demonstrated.  No new masses seen.  Post-radiation
 paramediastinal changes are stable.
