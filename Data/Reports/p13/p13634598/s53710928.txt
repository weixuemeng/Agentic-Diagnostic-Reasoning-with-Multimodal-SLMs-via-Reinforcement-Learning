  Hyperexpanded lungs are compatible with emphysema.  No large radiopaque masses
  are seen, however CT is far more sensitive for the detection of metastatic
  disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of bladder cancer, smoking history 
 // please evaluate for suspicious nodules concerning for metastatic disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs and vascular deficiency, mostly in the upper lobe zones,
 due to emphysema.  Greater radiodensity in lower lungs is likely due to
 physiologic redistribution of blood.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Specifically, there is no evidence of
 intrathoracic metastatic disease.  Scarring in the left suprahilar area
 accounts for elevation of left hilus compared to the right.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac silhouettes are normal.  Old rib fractures on right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease.
 2. Hyperinflated lungs and vascular deficiency in the upper lobes suggest
 obstructive disease.  Greater radiodensity in the lower lungs is likely due to
 physiologic redistribution of blood.
