                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with rhonchi
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  And aortic core valve device is seen.  The mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the
 aortic knob.  Hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is seen.  Lungs are hyperinflated with findings suggestive
 of emphysema.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a trace
 left pleural effusion.  Streaky atelectasis is noted in the retrocardiac
 region without focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis with trace left pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
