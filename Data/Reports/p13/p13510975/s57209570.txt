                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New leukocytosis, intubated, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:17 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present.  The carina is not optimally visualized but appears to
 lie in satisfactory position approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  An NG
 tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, including the superior mediastinum and biapical
 pleural thickening, an unusual finding in someone of this age.  This
 appearance is grossly stable compared with ___.  Allowing for low
 inspiratory volumes, no CHF or effusion is detected.  No supine film evidence
 of pneumothorax is detected.
 
 However, there is increased retrocardiac density, slightly increased compared
 with ___, but similar to ___, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, probably unchanged.  Otherwise, no focal infiltrate
 identified.
 
 2. Stable mild prominence of the mediastinum, with biapical pleural
 thickening.  Clinical correlation is requested for full assessment.
