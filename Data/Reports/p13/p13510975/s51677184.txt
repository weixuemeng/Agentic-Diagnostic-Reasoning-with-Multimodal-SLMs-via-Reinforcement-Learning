                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  V-fib arrest due to hyperkalemia.
 
 Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.3 cm
 above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off
 film.  Right IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  
 
 Compared with the prior film, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  Upper zone re-distribution and vascular plethora is unchanged. 
 Hazy opacity, right greater than left lung bases, likely reflects atelectasis,
 possibly with a small amount of layering pleural fluid -- this appears
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior film.  Biapical pleural fluid
 and/or thickening is again noted, unchanged.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes essentially unchanged.  Mild vascular plethora. 
 Atelectasis and ? minimal pleural fluid at both lung bases is slightly more
 pronounced.
