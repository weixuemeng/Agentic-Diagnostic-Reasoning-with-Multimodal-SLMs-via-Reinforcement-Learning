                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma with hypotension and renal failure.  Concern for
 ventilator-assisted pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  Tracheostomy tube, right-sided
 tunneled HD catheter, and left-sided PICC are all in stable position. 
 Pulmonary edema has continued to improve and now is minimal.  However,
 retrocardiac opacification persists.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving pulmonary edema with persistent retrocardiac
 opacification which again raises concern for pneumonia.
