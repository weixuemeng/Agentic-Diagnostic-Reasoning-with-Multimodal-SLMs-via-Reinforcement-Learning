                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, low O2 saturation, question pneumonia or pleural
 effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Compared with the
 prior exam there is slight increase in left pleural effusion and left basilar
 consolidation which likely represents compressive atelectasis.  There is mild
 right basilar plate-like atelectasis.  Upper lungs appear well aerated.  Heart
 size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in left pleural effusion and left basilar
 consolidation.  Recommend followup to resolution.
