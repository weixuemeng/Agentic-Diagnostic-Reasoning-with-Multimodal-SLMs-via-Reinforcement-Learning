                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There has been interval increase in size of the
 left pleural effusion which is now large in extent, and appears to be
 partially loculated over the left apex.  There is concomitant left basilar
 atelectasis.  Patchy opacity in the right lung base also likely reflects an
 area of atelectasis.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult
 to assess given the presence of a pleural effusion.  No vascular engorgement
 is present.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased size of left pleural effusion which is now large with
 bibasilar atelectasis.
