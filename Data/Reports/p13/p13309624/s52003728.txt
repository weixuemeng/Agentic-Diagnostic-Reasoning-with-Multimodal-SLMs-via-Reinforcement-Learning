                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, status post Pleurx tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is now a moderate left basilar
 pneumothorax status post Pleurx tube placement within the left basilar pleural
 space.  There has been a decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion
 which appears small in size.  Left mid lung field opacification may represent
 some loculation of the pleural fluid with atelectasis, though infection cannot
 be excluded. Nodular lobulations are noted within the left basilar pleura and
 along the left cardiac border.  Patchy opacities at the right lung base
 continue to reflect atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged,
 wihtout significant shift of mediastinal structures. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate left basilar pneumothorax status post Pleurx tube placement with
 no signs of tension. Small residual left pleural effusion.
 2.  Irregular nodular lobulations within the left basilar pleura. Further
 evaluation with a chest CT is recommended.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by ___ via telephone
 at 4:55 pm on the date of the study.
