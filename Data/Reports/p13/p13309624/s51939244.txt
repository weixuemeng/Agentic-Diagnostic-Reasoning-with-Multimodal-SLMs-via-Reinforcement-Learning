                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 again noted to be a large left pleural effusion with underlying consolidation
 which could in part reflect atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 Overall, there may be slight increase in the effusion from prior exam.  There
 is right basilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion impossible
 to exclude.  The bony structures appear intact.  Heart and mediastinal contour
 cannot be assessed due to adjacent consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left pleural effusion and left lower lung
 consolidation, likely atelectasis though cannot exclude pneumonia.
