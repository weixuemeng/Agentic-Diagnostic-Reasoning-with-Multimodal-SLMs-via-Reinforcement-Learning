                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath, question interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal AP view of the chest provided with patient
 positioned upright.  A dialysis catheter is again seen extending into the
 right atrium.  The heart remains markedly enlarged.  Pulmonary edema persists
 with increase in confluent opacity at the right lower lung which could
 represent a superimposed pneumonia.  No effusion or pneumothorax seen. 
 Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary edema with increased confluence of opacity in
 the right lower lung, raising potential concern for a superimposed pneumonia.
