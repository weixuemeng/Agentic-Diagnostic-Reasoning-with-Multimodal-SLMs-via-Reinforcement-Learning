                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate right lung opacities seen in prior study.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 7 hours earlier.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Pulmonary edema has markedly improved.  There
 is only mild vascular congestion.  Right lower lobe paracardiac opacity has
 markedly improved.  There are no lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or large
 effusions.  Large-bore right catheter is in standard position.
