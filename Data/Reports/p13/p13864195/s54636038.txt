                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with hepatitis.  Now with cough and
 decreased saturation, especially with walking.  Evaluate for possible
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Heart size remains normal.  Thoracic aorta as before of normal
 ___ but some calcium deposits are seen in the wall at the level of the
 arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of new pulmonary
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  No interval change
 since next preceding study three days ago.  Previous comment about mild
 bibasilar atelectasis and possible bronchial wall thickening is questioned as
 patient is rather adipose.  Definition of subtle bronchial changes would
 require high definition CT examination if such examination is clinically
 indicated.
