                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of fever for six days,
 status post NSVD.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is a linear lucency
 projecting over the posterior elements of a lower thoracic vertebra on the
 lateral view, could be artifactual, but a fracture is not excluded.  No prior
 for comparison.  Correlate clincally and additional imaging if warranted. 
 There is questionable mild prominence of the main pulmonary artery.
