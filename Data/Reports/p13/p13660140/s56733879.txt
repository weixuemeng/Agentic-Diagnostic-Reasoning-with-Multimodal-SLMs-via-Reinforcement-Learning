 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the feeding tube has been removed. 
 The transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation. Better appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph are bilateral small pleural effusions, restricted to the dorsal
 aspect of the costophrenic sinuses, and subsequent areas of bilateral basal
 atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Minimal paramediastinal scarring at the right lung apex.
