 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 09:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sick sinus syndrome, pacemaker, check
 position.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral view of ___ at 9:49 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of a dual-lead left-sided pacer with the leads
 terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively.  The heart remains enlarged.  There are layering
 bilateral effusions, left greater than right.  Retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis, though an evolving aspiration or pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  Calcification in the aorta is seen consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
