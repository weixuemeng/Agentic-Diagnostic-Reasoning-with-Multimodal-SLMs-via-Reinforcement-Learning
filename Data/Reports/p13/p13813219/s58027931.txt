                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The
 left atrial appendage appears enlarged.  There is persistent moderate blunting
 of the left costophrenic sulcus, suggestive of an effusion and unchanged. 
 There is no evidence for effusion on the right side.  Alternatively, this may
 be due to chronic pleural thickening.  Patchy right basilar density is similar
 to the earlier radiographs.  On this study, the lateral view suggests new
 posterior density, probably in the left lower lobe, not specific but
 suggestive of developing pneumonia, however.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing posterior density in the left lower lobe raising
 concern for developing pneumonia, although the area is difficult to assess.
