                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pleuritic chest pain for several weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The exam is
 suboptimal due to underpenetration due to patient's overlying body habitus. 
 No pleural effusion is seen.  No large focal consolidation is seen, although a
 small consolidation could be missed.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  There may be minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
