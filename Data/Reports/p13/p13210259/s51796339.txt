 right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities are
 potentially atelectasis. Correlate clinically for infection.  There are mildly
 increased interstitial markings.  A tortuous, calcified descending aorta is
 noted. Calcified apical scarring is seen.

 Unchanged left pleural effusion with new right pleural effusion and biasilar
 atelectasis. Correlate clinically for infection.
