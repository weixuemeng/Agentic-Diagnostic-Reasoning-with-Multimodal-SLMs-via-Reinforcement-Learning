                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sepsis recent ureteral stenting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___:06
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe dextroscoliosis and low lung volumes somewhat limits assessment. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Deformity of the sixth posterior right rib is unchanged, and could reflect the
 sequela of prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study without gross evidence for pneumonia.
