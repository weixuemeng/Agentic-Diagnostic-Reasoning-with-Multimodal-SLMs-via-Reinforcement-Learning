                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  HCC, ascites, evaluation for aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The current radiograph is compared to a portable x-ray from
 ___.
 
 There are differences in technique and a different projection angle of the
 x-ray beam.  The aortic contour is sharply delineated.  The calcific patterns
 of the aortic wall are comparable.  There is no apical cap.  Nevertheless,
 given the different techniques, the aortic knob projects in a different way
 than it did before, extending slightly more laterally and cranially than on
 the previous exam.  If the presence of an aortic aneurysm continues to be
 suspected based on the clinical presentation, the patient should proceed to
 CT, given the superior sensitivity of this technique.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions continue to be present and are better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal film.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild fluid overload.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 9:02 a.m., on ___, the
 referring physician ___. ___ was paged for notification. Findings
 were discussed a minute later over the telephone.
