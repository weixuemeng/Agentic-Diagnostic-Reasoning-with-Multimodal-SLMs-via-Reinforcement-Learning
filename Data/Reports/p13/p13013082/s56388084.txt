 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph provided.  A left arm PICC
 line is seen with its tip near the proximal SVC.  The orogastric tube
 terminates in the left upper quadrant.  There are bilateral lower lobe
 consolidations concerning for pneumonia.  A left pleural effusion is likely
 present, small.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable, though
 the left heart border is partially lost.  Bony structures appear grossly
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lobe consolidations, compatible with pneumonia with
 probable small left effusion.  Endogastric tube and PICC line appear
 positioned appropriately.
