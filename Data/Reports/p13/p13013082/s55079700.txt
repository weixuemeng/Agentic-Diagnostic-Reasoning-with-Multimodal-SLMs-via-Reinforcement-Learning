                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with metastaic cancer. has left arm PICC.  //
 please confirm location of PICC
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.  An orogastric tube terminates in the
 left upper quadrant. There is a left arm PICC line with its tip residing in
 the low SVC. Hazy lower lung opacities likely reflect layering effusions with
 probable subjacent atelectasis. There has been slight improvement in aeration
 compared with the prior exam with previously noted airspace consolidations
 appearing less conspicuous. The mid-upper lungs appear well-aerated. There is
 no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 PICC line and orogastric tubes in appropriate position. Improving aeration in
 the lower lungs with persistent layering effusions and adjacent lower lobe
 atelectasis.
