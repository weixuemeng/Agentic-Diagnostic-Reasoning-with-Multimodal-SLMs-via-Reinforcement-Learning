                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsened hypoxia, recent pigtail on R  //
 eval for pneumothorax, worsened edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right basal opacity appears to be slightly more pronounced than expected
 for E expanding the lung edema although still might reflect that process but
 attention to this area to exclude the possibility of developing infection is
 recommended. There is no change in left pleural effusion, large, a adjacent
 lung atelectasis, left PICC line and NG tube.
