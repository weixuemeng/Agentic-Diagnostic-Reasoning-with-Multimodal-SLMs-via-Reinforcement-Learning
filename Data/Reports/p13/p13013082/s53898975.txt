                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:15 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with abdominal CA, with increasing oxygen
 requirement, tachycardia and central chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed.  Moderately severe bibasilar
 consolidation is also worsened, now accompanied by new small left pleural
 effusion.  There is an enough pulmonary vascular congestion to suggest that
 this could be edema and atelectasis, but my first consideration would be
 pneumonia due to aspiration.
