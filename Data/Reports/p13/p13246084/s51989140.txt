                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe COPD here with R ptx sp bullectomy,
 volume overload, now with worsening hypoxemia  // ?ptx, flash pulm edema    
 ?ptx, flash pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 There has been little interval change since ___ except perhaps in a
 decrease in small to moderate right pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Lung volumes are lower now than on ___.  At least moderately severe edema
 at the lung bases is probably chronic, and because of the severe emphysema, at
 least in the left upper lobe, and atelectasis at the base of the right lower,
 pneumonia would be impossible to distinguish.  Chronic volume loss in the
 right hemi thorax is considerable, reflected in rightward mediastinal shift
 and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 
 Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
