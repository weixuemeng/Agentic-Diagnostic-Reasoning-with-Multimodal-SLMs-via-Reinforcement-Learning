                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o man with severe COPD (2L home O2) and AF on xarelto who
 presented on ___ with a spontaneous R pneumothorax now s/p RUL bullectomy c/b
 a fib RVR, normocytic anemia, pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTI s/p treatment, and
 now by likely aspiration PNA vs recurrent HCAP. Currently stable on 4L NC,
 followed by pulmonary and on Vanc/Cef. New hypoxia and hypotension  // eval
 for PTX  eval for PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacities are again seen, possibly slightly worse on the left.  Postsurgical
 changes from previous colectomy are again seen on the right.  More focal
 opacification at the left base could well reflect the aspiration pneumonia
 suggested clinically.
