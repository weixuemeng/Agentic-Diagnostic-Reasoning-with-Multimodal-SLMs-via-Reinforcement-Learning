                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe abdominal pain, history of colon
 cancer.  Evaluation for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  The study is read in conjunction with CT of the abdomen and
 pelvis, obtained two hours after this radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates a nasogastric tube
 coursing through the esophagus, below the diaphragm, with tip terminating in
 the fundus of the stomach.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates a
 tortuous aorta, but is otherwise unremarkable.  The lung volumes are
 relatively low, but demonstrate no focal opacity, pleural effusion, or
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is present.  Cholecystectomy clips are seen
 projecting over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube in appropriate position, with tip terminating in the
 fundus of the stomach.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of
 subdiaphragmatic free air.
