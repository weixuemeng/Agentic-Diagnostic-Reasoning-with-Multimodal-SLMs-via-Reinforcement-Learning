                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia and EKG changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Within the limitations of technique, although the heart has a left ventricular
 configuration, it is probably normal in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 There is a retrocardiac nodular density which is probably due to summation
 shadow of converging ribs and pulmonary markings; otherwise lung fields appear
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  When clinically feasible repeat
 standard PA and lateral radiography is suggested in order to reassess the left
 lung base regarding artifact versus, less likely, nodular density.
