                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intoxicated patient, status post trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Heart size is normal.  There is a tubular opacity in the left
 mid lung at the ___ posterior rib level.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes.  Tubular opacity in the left mid lung very likely represents
 superimposition of normal vessels and less likely a vascular malformation of
 mucous plugging.  Repeat radiographs with shallow oblique views may be helpful
 for further assessment.
