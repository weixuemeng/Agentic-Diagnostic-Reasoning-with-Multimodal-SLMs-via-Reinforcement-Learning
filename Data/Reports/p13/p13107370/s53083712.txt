                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right-sided rib pain after fall, evaluate
 for fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 are normal.  Both lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  A catheter is seen extending from the neck into
 the peritoneum on the right side and likely represents a VP shunt.
 
 No acute rib fractures are identified; however, if there is continued concern
 for rib fractures, then a dedicated rib series should be obtained.
