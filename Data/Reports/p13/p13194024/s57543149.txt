                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain and tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis
 without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There are mild degenerative changes seen in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
