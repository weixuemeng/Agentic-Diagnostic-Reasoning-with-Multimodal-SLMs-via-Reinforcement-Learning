                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for infiltrate or pneumonia in a patient with chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a heart which is top-normal
 in size.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Con for loss over the left ventricle and anterior to the heart on lateral view
 is likely related to insufficient inspiration.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Contour loss over the left
 ventricle and anterior to the heart on lateral view is likely related to
 insufficient inspiration.  If the patient's symptoms continue, repeat
 radiograph in 48 hours can be obtained.
