                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent hospitalization for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the low SVC.  The heart size appears moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours unremarkable.  Low lung volumes resulting
 crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities are seen in the lung bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis,
 but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are likely present.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but aspiration or
 infection cannot be excluded.  Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions.
