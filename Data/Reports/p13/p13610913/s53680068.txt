                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  MRSA bacteremia with question cavitary lesion seen on outside chest
 CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  The outside chest CT is not available, the most recent chest image
 from ___ is from ___.  There is a left-sided PICC line with tip
 in the right atrium.  There are patchy areas of increased opacity and areas of
 peripheral lucency that may be due to some bullous change.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged and there is minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution, but no
 overt pulmonary edema.  Compared to the study from ___, the appearance of
 the lungs is slightly improved.  It would be helpful to obtain the outside CT
 in order to direct the investigation to the area of suspected acute disease.
