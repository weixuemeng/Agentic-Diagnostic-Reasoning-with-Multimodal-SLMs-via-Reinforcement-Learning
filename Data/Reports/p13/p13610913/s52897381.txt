                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with an outside hospital study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  There is peripheral
 reticular opacities which appear stable from prior exam which could indicate
 underlying interstitial lung disease.  There is vague opacity at the left CP
 angle which is stable and is suggestive of scarring.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite signs of CHF.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 appear stable.  Bony structures are intact with old deformity of the left mid
 clavicular shaft.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peripheral reticular opacities raise concern for underlying
 interstitial lung disease.  No acute findings.
