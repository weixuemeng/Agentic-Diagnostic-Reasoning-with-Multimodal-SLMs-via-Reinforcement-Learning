                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta is
 tortuous.  Bilateral diffuse interstitial abnormalities are present,
 characterized by coarse reticular opacities and minimal adjacent ground-glass
 opacities.  These findings are most prominent in the lung periphery and have a
 slightly basilar predominance as well.  Although similar coarse reticular
 interstitial opacities have been present since outside chest x-ray of ___, on the lateral view, confluent increased opacity overlying the lower
 thoracic spine is new since the most recent lateral chest x-ray of ___.  No acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Confluent opacity overlying lower thoracic spine on lateral view,
 concerning for basilar pneumonia.
 
 2.  Widespread coarse reticular opacities favor chronic lung disease, but
 superimposed atypical/interstitial pneumonia is also possible.
