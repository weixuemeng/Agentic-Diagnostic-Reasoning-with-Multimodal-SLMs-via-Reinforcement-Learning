 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:30 PM
  No evidence of acute process.  Newly apparent rounded nodular density
  projecting over the right lung apex; although maybe bony in origin or due to
  scarring, when clinically appropriate, evaluation in follow-up with chest CT
  is suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and cervical spine CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is at the upper limits of
 normal size.  Patchy left lateral basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis
 that is unchanged.  There is a newly apparent round nodular opacity projecting
 over the right lung apex measuring about 7 mm in diameter.  Although the area
 is difficult to evaluate due to overlapping bony structures, and it is known
 that scarring is present in the area from a prior CT of the cervical spine,
 the possibility of superimposed pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded by this
 study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are
 similar along the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  However, there is a newly apparent
 nodular focus projecting over the right lung apex, potentially a true
 pulmonary nodule, although a bone island or scarring depicted in a somewhat
 different fashion could potentially explain the finding.  When clinically
 appropriate, chest CT is suggested to evaluate further in followup.
