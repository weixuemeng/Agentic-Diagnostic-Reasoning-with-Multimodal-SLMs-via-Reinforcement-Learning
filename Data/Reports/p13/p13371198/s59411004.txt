                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size cannot be assessed as sizable left-sided pleural
 effusion conceals left-sided diaphragm and cardiac contours.  The pleural
 effusion reaches up to the hilar level along the lateral chest wall.  Just in
 the hilar region and somewhat below, a few centimeters of spontaneous air
 bronchogram can be identified, but the periphery of the left lower parenchyma
 is concealed.  The remaining upper portion of the left hemithorax demonstrates
 pulmonary vasculature, with unremarkable appearance.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 The right hemithorax shows grossly normal findings.  Right lateral and
 posterior pleural sinus is free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Sizable left-sided pleural effusion.  Left lower lung tissue
 concealed.  If course of pleural effusion has not been determined, evaluation
 of lung by CT is recommended.
