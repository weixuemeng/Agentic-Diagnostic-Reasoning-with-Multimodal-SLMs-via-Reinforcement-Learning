                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a
 thoracentesis performed with removal of substantial amount of free pleural
 fluid.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 There is a vague area of increased opacification overlying the anterior
 portion of the fourth posterior rib on the right laterally.  This could
 represent a combination of small calcifications.  Comparison with prior images
 from an outside hospital would be helpful.
