                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and some shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.  Widening
 of the mediastinum without obscuration of the right hilum is of unclear
 clinical significance. A tortuous aorta is present.  The cardiac contour is
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Apparent mediastinal widening of unclear clinical significance
 but likely due to unfolding aorta. However, given that there is no prior study
 for comparison, PA and lateral chest radiographs should be performed for more
 detailed assessment.
