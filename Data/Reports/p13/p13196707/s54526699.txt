                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a history of recently diagnosedmetastatic adenocarcinoma
 of unknown primary with brain, bone,liver metastases, SVC syndrome s/p
 stenting and multiple UEthrombosis on lovenox, with hospital course notable
 for pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis, tx for PNA, and altered
 mental status. Significant family meeting ___ -> pt is DNR/DNI.  // ?Pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian line has its tip in projected over the cavoatrial junction,
 unchanged from prior.  Dobbhoff tube has its tip projecting over the stomach. 
 There are  small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left, unchanged from prior.  There has been interval improvement in the
 diffuse haziness throughout both lungs likely represent improving pulmonary
 edema.  There is persistent consolidative opacities in both lower lobes, that
 could represent atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be excluded. Mildly
 enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

 3.  Unchanged small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left, unchanged from prior.
 3. Interval improvement in  diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema.
 4. Persistent consolidative opacities in both lower lobes, that could
