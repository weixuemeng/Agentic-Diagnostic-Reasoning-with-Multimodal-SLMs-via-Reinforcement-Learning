                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  Subtle area of increased opacity has developed in the
 right retrocardiac region, correlating to the posterior basilar segment of the
 right lower lobe on the lateral view.  Lungs are otherwise grossly clear, and
 there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of right lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs in four weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy may be
 helpful to document resolution, as entered in radiology communications
 dashboard on date of the study.
