                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Asymmetric opacification of the right lung base with respect to the
 left could be due to basilar pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is moderately engorged, but there is
 no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely
 enlarged with left atrial and ventricular enlargement particularly striking on
 the lateral view.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable right lower lobe pneumonia. Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly chronic, vascular engorgement of uncertain chronicity; whether
 there is acute on chronic cardiac decompensation is radiographically
 indeterminate without prior imaging for comparison.
