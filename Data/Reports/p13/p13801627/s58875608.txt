                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 view is suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Additionally, on the
 frontal view, the patient is rotated to the left.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  Patchy left basilar opacity is seen, which most
 likely relates to atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is
 moderate compression of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction which
 is likely grossly stable as compared to ___ thoracic spine radiograph
 from outside institution.  The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable.  There
 may be minimal vascular congestion, although pulmonary vasculature may be
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
