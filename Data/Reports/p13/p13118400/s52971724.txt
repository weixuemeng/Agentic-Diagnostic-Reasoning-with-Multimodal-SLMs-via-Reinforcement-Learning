                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema;
 evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The tip of the right PICC line ends at lower SVC/cavoatrial
 junction. Over last 3 days, asymmetrically improved pulmonary opacities can be
 simply explained by improving asymmetric pulmonary edema (right side more than
 left). However,  concurrent infection cannot be ruled out. Mildly enlarged
 heart and mediastinal congestion is unchanged.
