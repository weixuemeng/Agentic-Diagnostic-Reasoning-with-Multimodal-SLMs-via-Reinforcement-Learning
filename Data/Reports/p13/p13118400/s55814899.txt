                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with weakness and fatigue.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lungs are somewhat low in volume with bibasilar left
 greater than right atelectasis, at least in part owing to chronic elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm, which is slightly increased on the current study.  No
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is seen.  Mild vascular
 redistribution is seen, suggesting vascular congestion without overt edema
 identified on this study.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged with a tortuous
 aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion without evidence of pneumonia.
