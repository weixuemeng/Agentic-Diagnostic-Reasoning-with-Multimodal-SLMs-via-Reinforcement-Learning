                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal carcinoma status post esophageal stent
 placement.  Fistula has now formed between the esophagus and lung.
 
 CHEST COMPARISON FILM:  ___.
 
 Bilateral effusions present on the prior chest x-ray have resolved with only
 small bilateral effusions now present.  The left lung is essentially clear. 
 The lateral film shows the position of the esophageal stent.  Small air-filled
 cavity is present in the right mid zone and opacification posteriorly on the
 right side is seen, probably representing a loculated effusion in this area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considerable improvement over prior chest x-ray.
