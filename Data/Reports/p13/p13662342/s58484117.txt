                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is slight unfolding of the
 lower descending thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable.  There is a patchy opacity in the medial lower and
 right mid lung, most consistent with pneumonia.  Since the cardiac border can
 mostly be discerned, the abnormality is suspected to at least predominantly
 reside in the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pneumonia in the right lower lobe. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended following treatment in order to ensure
 resolution.
