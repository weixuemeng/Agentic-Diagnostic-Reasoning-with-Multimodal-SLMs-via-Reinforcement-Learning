                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough and change in respiratory status.  Assess for
 aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Left lower lobe opacities have increased worrisome for aspiration. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right lower lobe and right mid lung
 opacities are more chronic and stable.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  A catheter projects in the left upper quadrant.
