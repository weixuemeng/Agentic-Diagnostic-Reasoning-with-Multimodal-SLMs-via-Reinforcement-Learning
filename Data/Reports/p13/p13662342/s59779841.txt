                                 FINAL REPORT
 ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph and CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Homogeneous opacity extends from the minor fissure to a partially
 obscured right hemidiaphragm, with associated signs of volume loss.  Observed
 findings likely represent collapse of the right middle lobe and partial
 atelectasis of the right lower lobe, the latter coexisting with known complex
 fluid collection and consolidation based on review of recent CT.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion has increased in size in the interval.  New bilateral
 asymmetrical perihilar opacities worse on the left than the right could
 reflect pulmonary edema or new sites of aspiration or infection.  Dense left
 retrocardiac opacity and a small left pleural effusion are also new.  Since
 the prior study, esophageal stent has been placed, and the patient has been
 intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating at the level of the
 medial clavicles, about 7.7 cm above the carina.  This could be advanced a few
 centimeters for standard positioning.  Dr.___ has been telephoned with
 these results at 4:15 on ___.
