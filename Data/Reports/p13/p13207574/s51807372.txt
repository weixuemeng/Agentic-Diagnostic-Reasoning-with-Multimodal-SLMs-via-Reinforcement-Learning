                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, vomiting common diarrhea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung volumes
 crowd the central pulmonary vasculature.  In addition, prominence of the upper
 lobe vasculature may suggest a mild degree of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are mild.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes.  There may be mild central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 2.  No pneumoperitoneum.
