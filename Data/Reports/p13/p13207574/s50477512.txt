                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Weakness, respiratory complaints.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Patchy medial right basilar opacity most likely
 represents overlap of structures and atelectasis rather than consolidation. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.
