                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same day.
 
 New right internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the right
 brachiocephalic vein just below the right medial clavicle.  There is no
 visible pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study, with
 resultant accentuation of cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities have developed, more prominent in the left lower
 lobe than the right.  Given the rapid development, this may be due to either
 aspiration or atelectasis.
