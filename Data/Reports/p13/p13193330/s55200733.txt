  1.  Limited examination secondary to patient positioning, overlying soft
  tissues and low lung volumes.  However, there appears to be a new ill-defined
  right perihilar opacity which raises concern for a new focal consolidation.
  Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further assessment.  2.
  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is likely secondary to pleural
  fluid and atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath  // ___ ___ pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Limited examination secondary to patient positioning and overlying soft
 tissues.
 
 As compared to prior examination, lung volumes are decreased causing crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures.  There appears to be an ill-defined right
 perihilar opacity which is difficult to evaluate on this examination, but
 raises concern for a new focal opacity.  Blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles is likely secondary to atelectasis and pleural fluid.
