                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is kyphotic in position and rotated to the right.  Basilar
 atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation.  There are multiple
 left-sided old-appearing rib fractures with some associated opacity along the
 left pleura which may be due to pleural thickening from prior trauma.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to
 mildly enlarged.  Aorta is unfolded.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
