                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with productive cough for 3 days.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again, relatively low lung volumes are seen. 
 There is retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view which correlates with
 increased density projecting over the right hemidiaphragm on the lateral view.
 This is not significantly changed however and may represent atelectasis noting
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Left lower lung calcified granuloma and
 bilateral hilar calcified nodes suggest previous granulomatous infection.  No
 acute osseous abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left basilar opacity potentially due to atelectasis in setting of low
 lung volumes, however pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Repeat exam with better
 inspiratory effort can be attempted if desired.
