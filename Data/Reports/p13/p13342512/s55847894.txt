                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia after bronchoscopy and endobronchial
 ultrasound.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT chest
 from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal width is unremarkable.  Severe emphysema is
 present.  Prominent azygos lobe level is consistent with large lymphadenopathy
 in this location.  Right upper lobe posterior segment nodule can be also seen
 on the chest radiograph.  Minimal bibasilar linear opacities are consistent
 with atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
