                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___.  PET-CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous. 
 Fullness of the right hilum is unchanged, compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  Previously noted enlargement of the right mediastinal
 contour at the level of the azygos is less pronounced on the current study
 suggesting somewhat improved lymphadenopathy.  The lungs are hyperinflated. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Extensive emphysematous changes
 are again noted, most pronounced within the lung apices.  Nodular opacity
 within the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe is not as clearly
 visualized on the current study.  There is no new focal consolidation.  Linear
 atelectasis or scarring is seen within the lung bases.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Previously noted mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be slightly improved. 
 Fullness of the right hilum is unchanged and reflective of known
 lymphadenopathy.
 
 2. Emphysema.
 
 3. Known nodule within the right upper lobe is better seen on the prior exams.
