 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Left mid lung opacity is
 seen worrisome for consolidation which could be due to infection or infarct
 depending on the clinical scenario.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 persistent slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be due
 to pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lateral right chest opacity could be due to infection. 
 Differential diagnosis also includes pulmonary infarct depending on the
 clinical scenario.
