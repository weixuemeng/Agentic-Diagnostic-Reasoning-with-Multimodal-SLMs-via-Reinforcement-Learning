                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits allowing for low lung
 volumes.  Dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
