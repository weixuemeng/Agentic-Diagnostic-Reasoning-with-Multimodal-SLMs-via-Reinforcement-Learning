  ETT terminates approximately 6.5-cm above the carina. OGT terminates within
  the body of the stomach. There has been interval progression of the
  consolidation in the left lung, presumably secondary to aspiration pneumonia,
  which is severe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are persistent.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with OGT and intubated, pls assess for OGT and
 ETT placement  // ___ year old man with OGT and intubated, pls assess for OGT
 and ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe left lung pneumonia has probably worsened since ___. There may also
 be a small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacification could be progressive
 pneumonia or concurrent atelectasis. Only the right upper lobe is entirely
 clear. Heart borderline enlarged, unchanged. Right pleural effusion small if
 any. Lines and tubes unchanged in their expected positions. Right internal
 jugular line ends at a level nearly 7 cm below the carina and would need to be
 withdrawn 3 cm to reposition it in the low SVC, if that is desired. ,
