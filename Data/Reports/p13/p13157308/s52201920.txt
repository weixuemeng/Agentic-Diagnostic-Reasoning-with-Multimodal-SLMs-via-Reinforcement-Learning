                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Lungs are low in volume but
 clear aside from minimal basal scarring/atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic sulci bilaterally could reflect trace pleural effusions or
 pleural thickening.  The heart is top-normal in size with normal mediastinal
 and hilar contours aside from a tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without acute intrathoracic process.
