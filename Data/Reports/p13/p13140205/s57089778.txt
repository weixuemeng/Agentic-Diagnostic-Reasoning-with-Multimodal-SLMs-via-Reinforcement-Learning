                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax; follow up after chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new small caliber chest tube has been placed, terminating at the
 right lung apex.  A right-sided pneumothorax is dramatically smaller and
 perhaps fully resolved, although potentially with trace lucency near the tip
 of the tube.  The right lung is reexpanded with mild residual atelectasis of
 the right upper lobe.  Mediastinal shift has resolved.  The left lung remains
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially resolved pneumothorax with chest tube placement.
