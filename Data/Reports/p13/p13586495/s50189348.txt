                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up abnormality in the left lower lobe seen in prior
 chest x-ray from ___.
 
 Rounded opacity in the left lower lobe has markedly increased.  This is
 associated with more peripheral ill-defined posterior opacities.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated.  The hemidiaphragms are flattened, consistent with COPD. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Wedge-shaped deformities of mid thoracic vertebral bodies are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening rounded opacity in the left lower lobe.  Differential
 diagnosis is broad and includes malignancy. Should be evaluated with CT.
