                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with COPD and known lung mass, now
 with low oxygen saturation, hemoptysis and dyspnea, infiltrates.  Evaluate for
 progression of lung mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged
 and is within normal limits.  Also unchanged appearance of thoracic aorta.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  The right-sided hemithorax is
 unchanged and does not demonstrate any new infiltrates, masses or pleural
 effusion.  On the left side, the previously identified mass lesion in the
 proximal portion of the left lower lobe has increased in size.  It involves
 now also the periphery of the left lower lobe and reaches the pleural space. 
 On the lateral view, one can identify a moderate amount of pleural effusion
 surrounding the mass.  There is no evidence of any secondary metastases and no
 pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of left lower lobe mass into periphery and now having
 contact with pleural space with moderate amount of pleural effusion.
