                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD and known left lower lobe
 lung mass.  Patient is now presenting with hypoxia and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Consolidation within the left lung base
 appears slightly increased on the frontal view as compared to recent prior
 examination from ___.  However, on the lateral view, the opacity
 appears severity.  A small amount of pleural fluid is likely associated with
 this opacity.  The probable slight increase in the opacity may be due to
 either progression of underlying tumor or possibly due to superimposed
 infection.  The remainder of the lungs appear clear.  There is evidence of
 emphysema. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval increase in known left lower lobe opacity, more
 obvious on the frontal projection as compared to the lateral view.  Findings
 could reflect progression of known tumor or superimposed infection.
