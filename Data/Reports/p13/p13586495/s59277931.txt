                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with severe COPD and worsening dyspnea
 for the past week.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged and remains within normal limits. 
 Thoracic aorta mildly widened and elongated with calcium deposit in the wall,
 but no evidence of local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  As before, however, a rather prominent central pulmonary
 vessel in irregular peripheral distribution, which coincides with low
 positioned diaphragms that are flattened, is suggestive of rather prominent
 COPD.  Comparison with the next preceding examination demonstrates that a
 local new infiltrate has developed on the left lung base partially located in
 retrocardiac position.  The infiltrate overlies also the anterior contours of
 the lowermost thoracic spine on the lateral view.  Thus, the present
 examination identifies a new acute infiltrate in the left lower lobe posterior
 segment area in this patient with known rather advanced COPD.  It is
 recommended to perform a followup chest examination after treatment in about
 one to two weeks.  At this time, it will have to be decided if patient
 requires a chest CT examination if findings are not regressing.
