                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, for further evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison to prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously appreciated mild and diffuse increase in the lung parenchymal
 density in the lower lobes causing a so-called spine sign is no more
 appreciated on the today's radiograph.  Lungs are clear without any new
 opacities of concern.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Both pleural spaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION
 
 Previously appreciated very ill-defined increased parenchymal density in the
 lower lung leading to a spine sign and concerning for an early infection has
 resolved.
