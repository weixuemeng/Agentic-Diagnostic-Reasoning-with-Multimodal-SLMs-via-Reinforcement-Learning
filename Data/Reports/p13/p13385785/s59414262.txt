                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, left basilar crackles, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.  On
 the frontal image, no abnormality in the lung parenchyma is noted.  On the
 lateral image, however, there is a so called spine sign, with an increase in
 density of the lung parenchyma at the level of the lower lobes.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, this can potentially indicate the presence of an
 infectious process at the level of the lower lobes.
 
 There are no pleural effusions.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
 pneumothorax.
