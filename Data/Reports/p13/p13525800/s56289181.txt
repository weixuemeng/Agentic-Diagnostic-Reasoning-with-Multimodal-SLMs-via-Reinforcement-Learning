                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sharp left-sided chest pain, most present at
 the left lateral costal margin.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits; the mediastinal contours
 demonstrate a tortuous aorta, exaggerated by patient rotation.  The lungs
 demonstrate left basilar consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  No
 displaced rib fracture is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation, in the appropriate clinical
 setting is compatible with pneumonia; an additional consideration is pulmonary
 infarct; follow-up imaging to document resolution would be recommended.
