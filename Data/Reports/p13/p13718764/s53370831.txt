 pulmonary vascular congestion and edema.  Blunting at the right costophrenic
 angle is new from the most recent prior study suggesting a small right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion/edema and small right pleural effusion
 suggest acute moderate congestive heart failure.
 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
