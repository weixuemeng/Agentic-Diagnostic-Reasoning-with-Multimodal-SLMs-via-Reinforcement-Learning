                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient arm/soft tissue overlies the upper half of the chest on the
 lateral view, partially obscuring the view.  Given this, the cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Prominence and indistinctness of the hila
 suggest mild to moderate vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Vascular congestion, similar to prior.  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette.
