                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever cough  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are apparent on the lateral view. There is no pneumothorax. The
 lungs are well-expanded. There is a new partly ill-defined density in the
 right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia.  This area appears confluent with
 the previously noted right upper lobe partly solid lesion, best assessed on
 the prior chest CT. A more subtle opacity along the right upper mediastinum is
 again noted, consistent with the patient's known malignancy. The upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right upper lobe density concerning for pneumonia.  Enlarging mass is
 in the differential diagnosis.
 2.  Known right upper lobe masses consistent with malignancy are better
 assessed on the recent chest CT.
