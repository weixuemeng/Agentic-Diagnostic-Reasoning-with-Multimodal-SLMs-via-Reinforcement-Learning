                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP upright AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with stage IV lung adeno p/w cough, fatigue, fevers
 and SOB.  // please assess for post-obstructive pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___. CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is the ill-defined
 opacity in the right upper lobe which is somewhat different appearance
 compared with prior chest radiograph suggesting resolution of previously noted
 right upper lobe pneumonia. There is apparent collapse of the posterior
 segment of the right upper lobe on the lateral projection. The left lung is
 clear. No effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe opacity, slightly different in appearance from prior
 radiograph of the chest with collapse of the posterior segment of the right
 upper lobe. Given patient's history of malignancy, a CT may be performed to
 further assess if needed.
