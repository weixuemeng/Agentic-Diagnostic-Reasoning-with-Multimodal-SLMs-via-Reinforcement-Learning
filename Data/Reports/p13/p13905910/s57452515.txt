                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with closed loop obstruction, s/p exlap, LOA,
 has NGT  // check NGT position
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is present, tip overlies the gastric fundus/ proximal stomach.  The
 sideport lies in the region of the GE junction, not definitely beyond it.
 
 Again seen is a a left-sided dual lead pacemaker with lead tips over the right
 atrium right ventricle.  Thin wirelike density in may represent an epidural
 catheter.
 
 There is linear somewhat patchy opacity at the left lung base, new compared
 with ___.  No CHF.
 Long was are otherwise grossly clear, without CHF, other opacities, or gross
 effusion.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is present.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.
 There is curvilinear lucency below the right hemidiaphragm
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. NG tube tip over gastric fundus/proximal stomach.  The side port lies in
 the region of the GE junction, but does not definitely extend beyond the GE
 junction.
 2. Patchy opacity at left lung base, new compared with ___ chest
 x-ray hand apparently new compared with abdominal CT from ___. 
 Question atelectasis.  In appropriate clinical setting, the differential
 diagnosis could include an pneumonic infiltrate or changes due to aspiration.
 3. Unusual curvilinear lucency immediately below the right hemidiaphragm.  The
 appearance is not typical for intraperitoneal air.  Question unusual artifact
 due to overlying bowel or superimposed diaphragmatic shadows.  However, the
 possibility of free intra-abdominal air cannot be entirely excluded.  If
 clinically indicated, a lateral view could help for further assessment.
