                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with coronary artery disease with recurrent chest
 pain, cough, fevers and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes are seen on
 the current exam, particularly on the lateral view.  The lungs, however, are
 grossly clear without consolidation or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits, noting a tortuous descending thoracic
 aorta.  Surgical clips are identified in the right upper quadrant suggesting
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
