                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with liver dz, bibasilar crackles  // atlectasis
 vs. edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate overinflation.  Areas of bilateral scarring at the lung bases. 
 Minimal scars in the right lung apex.  The findings are consistent with
 relatively advanced COPD.  There is no evidence, however, of acute lung
 disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Nonetheless, CT could be
 performed to further clarify lung morphology and to evaluate potential
 morphological reasons for the clinical presentation of the patient.
