                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of right-sided chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available for comparison.  Reference
 made to PET-CT performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Pulmonary
 emphysematous changes are better assessed on CT.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings may be related to patient's underlying emphysema.  There
 is mild bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of interstitial markings most likely relates to
 pulmonary emphysema seen on prior PET-CT.  Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis/scarring.  No definite consolidation or opacities to suggest mass,
 however, CT is more sensitive and if this is of concern, should be considered.
