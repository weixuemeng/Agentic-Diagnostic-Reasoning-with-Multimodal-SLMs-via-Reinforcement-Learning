                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Significant asthma with influenza and pneumonia per imaging at
 outside hospital.  Please assess for resolution.  The patient is wheezing
 currently, but no fever or productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ and CTA chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with a prominent left hilar density corresponding with minimally
 enlarged left pulmonary artery (with preservation of normal diameter
 centrally), better evident on CTA performed ___.  Lungs are clear. 
 Moderate peribronchial cuffing identified consistent with reported history of
 asthma and upper respiratory infection.  No focal pulmonary opacification
 identified. Multilevel degenerative change detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Peribronchial thickening may represent
 asthma or bronchitis.
