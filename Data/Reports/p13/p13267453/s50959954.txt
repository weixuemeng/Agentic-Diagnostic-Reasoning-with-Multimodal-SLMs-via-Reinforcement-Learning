                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are very low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected on this single view.  A calcified left upper lobe
 granuloma is noted. The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Heart size is
 difficult to evaluate in the setting of very low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation of the mid and lower lungs.
