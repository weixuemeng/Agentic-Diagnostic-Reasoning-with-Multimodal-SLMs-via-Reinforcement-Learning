                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS v. pneumonia. desat to ___% while
 turning  // eval for interval change, lobar collapse      eval for interval
 change, lobar collapse
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  There is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure that may have
 improved since the prior study.  The hemidiaphragm on the right is better
 seen, suggesting some improved pleural effusion, though this could merely be a
 reflection of a more upright position of the patient.  Opacification at the
 left base is consistent with atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
