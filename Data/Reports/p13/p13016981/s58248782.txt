  Left lower lobe opacity persists. given left hemidiaphragm elevation, this may
  be due to atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded given fever. tiny free
  intraperitoneal air may be related to recent PTBD placement but if there is
  concern for intra-abdominal process, CT could be performed

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bacteremia with possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 the suggestion of a subtle area of increased opacification at the left base. 
 This could well represent merely atelectatic streaks, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting a developing focus of pneumonia could be
 considered.  Otherwise, the study is within normal limits.  There is a small
 amount of gas beneath the right hemidiaphragm, related to recent catheter
 placement.  A more ominous cause of free intraperitoneal gas, CT could be
 obtained.
