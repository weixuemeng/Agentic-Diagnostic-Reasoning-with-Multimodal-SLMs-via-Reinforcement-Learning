  Subtle left lower lung opacity.  This could represent pneumonia given this
  patient's clinical picture.  Consider obtaining PA and lateral chest
  radiographs for better characterization.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever with bacteremia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is a subtle area of increased
 opacification at the left base which, in view of the clinical history, could
 represent a focus of pneumonia.  A lateral view would be most helpful if the
 clinical condition of the patient would permit.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
