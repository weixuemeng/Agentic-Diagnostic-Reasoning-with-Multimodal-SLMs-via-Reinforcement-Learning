                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a subdural hematoma after falling, now with
 cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside facility cervical spine CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lungs are
 generally hyperinflated.  The left lower lobe is completely collapsed, and the
 atelectatic lobe is of small volume suggesting chronicity.  Convexity of left
 infrahilar contour raises the possibility of an obstructing mass.  There is an
 ill-defined opacity in the right apex that projects over the right second and
 third ribs, likely related to scarring as seen on the outside facility
 cervical spine CT performed on ___.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion.  No pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse.  Recommend chest CT to exclude an underlying
 malignancy.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Contrast-enhanced chest CT to evaluate for possible
 obstructing neoplasm has a cause of complete left lower lobe collapse
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The recommendation for a chest CT represents a update to the
 initial wet read, which was emailed to the ED QA nurses on ___ at
 09:51.
