                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p exlap, LOA, ventral hernia repair  // NGT
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Radiograph centered at the upper abdomen was obtained for assessment of a
 nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach.  Low lying endotracheal
 tube is also demonstrated, with tip terminating within 2 cm of the carina. 
 This could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning.  As compared to
 recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, note is made of worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion and increasing left lower lobe atelectasis with adjacent
 small pleural effusion.  No other relevant change.
