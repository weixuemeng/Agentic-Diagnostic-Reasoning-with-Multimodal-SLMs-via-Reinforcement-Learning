 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with morbid obesity, post-op; acute desat  //
 acute desaturation      acute desaturation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes with
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette.  There has been increase in engorgement and
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests pleural fluid.
 Areas of increased opacification are seen at both bases.  Although most likely
 representing a combination of pulmonary edema and atelectasis, in the
 appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude
 superimposed pneumonia.  Especially in the absence of a lateral view.
