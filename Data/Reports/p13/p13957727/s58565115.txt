                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Calcified lymph nodes are again demonstrated
 in the right paratracheal region.  Previously present areas of atelectasis
 involving the bases have nearly completely resolved with small amount of
 residual linear atelectasis remaining on the right.  Small calcified granuloma
 in right upper lobe is incidentally noted.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and
 there are no pleural effusions.  Healing right anterior rib fractures are only
 faintly visible, and chest radiography is not ideal for evaluating the
 anterior aspects of the ribs.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Known manubrial fracture is likely obscured by overlying soft tissues of the
 patient's arms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Healing right anterior rib fractures.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
