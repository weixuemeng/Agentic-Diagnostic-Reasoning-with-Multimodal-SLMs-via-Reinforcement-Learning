                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  A ~1 cm nodular opacity is identified just superior to the
 right hilus.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  A convex
 contour arising from the descending and ascending thoracic aorta appears
 unchanged compared to prior and corresponds with known aneurysmal dilatation
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.  Known aortic valvular
 calcifications are not well seen on this radiographic examination, though may
 reflect underlying aortic stenosis. The remainder of the mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. ~1 cm nodular opacity in the medial right upper lobe.  Findings may reflect
 parenchymal nodule or overlapping vasculature. Repeat PA and lateral should be
 completed for further assessment if CT is not done
 
 2.  Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. 
 Dedicated chest CT should be completed to assess stability since prior CT was
 from ___ year prior.
