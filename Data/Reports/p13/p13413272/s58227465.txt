 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with chronic pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Despite the basal pleural drains in the right hemithorax, there has been a
 substantial increase in the right pleural effusion, largely basal, with a
 small lateral component, relative to ___.  The right bronchial tree is
 obliterated at the level of the upper lobe takeoff, whether by extrinsic
 compression, invasion, or retained secretions would require CT scanning.  Left
 lung clear.  Small left pleural effusion is new.  Cardiac silhouette is
 obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in the right hemithorax and
 shifted ipsilaterally, but does not appear to be enlarged.
