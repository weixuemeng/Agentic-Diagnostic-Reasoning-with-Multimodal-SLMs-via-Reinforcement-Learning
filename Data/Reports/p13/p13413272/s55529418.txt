 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pleural catheters remain in place in the right hemithorax, with
 persistent moderate right apical pneumothorax and slight increase in size of a
 moderate loculated right basilar hydropneumothorax.  Persistent volume loss in
 the right hemithorax with associated collapse of the right middle lobe and
 partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  Slight improved aeration in the
 left lower lobe with a small residual pleural effusion and adjacent minor left
 basilar atelectasis.  Unchanged widening of mediastinal contours, likely due
 to known lymphadenopathy on prior chest CT of ___.
