                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue with decreased p.o. intake, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Dual-lead pacer
 is unchanged with aortic endograft again seen with unchanged positions.  Lung
 volumes are low.  There is a similar appearance of bilateral reticulonodular
 opacities as compared with the prior radiograph, which may represent mild
 edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change with bilateral reticulonodular
 opacities, possibly reflective of edema, though consideration may be given to
 benefit of a chest CT for further characterization.
