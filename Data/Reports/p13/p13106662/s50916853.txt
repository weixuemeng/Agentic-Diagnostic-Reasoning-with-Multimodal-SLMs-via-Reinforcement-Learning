                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior studies, including chest
 radiographs from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperinflation of the
 lungs, with no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  There is relative paucity of lung
 markings in the bilateral upper lobes, compatible with underlying emphysema. 
 Bibasilar insterstitial abnormality is again seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  Tracheal narrowing is again seen at the level of
 the aortic arch, unchanged compared to prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION: Severe emphysema. Bibasilar interstitial abnormality, possibly due
 to mild superimposed edema.  This finding may be chronic, as it is not
 significantly changed from prior studies, although this could be acute
 exacerbation seen at multiple time points.
