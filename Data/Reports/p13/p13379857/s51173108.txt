                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Upper abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 The right lung base appears elevated, which may represent subpulmonic pleural
 effusion or alternatively ascites.  Right lung base opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged, increased from prior.  Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates
 paucity of gas.  Surgical clips project over right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly, increased from prior exam, may represent pericardial
 effusion.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  
 
 2.Elevation of the right lung base is new from ___ exam, which may
 represent a subpulmonic pleural effusion, or subphrenic pathology, such as
 ascites.  Right lung base opacity likely represents atelectasis.
