                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 23:38
 .
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with two chest tubes removed, one still in
 place.  Assess for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study ___ at 12:53.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 23:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of two left chest tubes with one remaining in place
 having its tip at the left apex.  There is increasing opacification in the
 left mid to lower lung with some residual aerated lung at the left apex. 
 These findings most likely reflect increasing partial lobar atelectasis,
 although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  The
 right lung has somewhat decreased in volume, but is grossly clear.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged given patient rotation
 on the current exam.  There is a stable small left apical pneumothorax. 
 Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
