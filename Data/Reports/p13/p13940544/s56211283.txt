 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube remains
 in situ.  The diameter of the mediastinum and the size of the cardiac
 silhouette have markedly decreased.  The apical portion of the left lung is
 substantially better ventilated.  A small millimetric post-procedural
 pneumothorax persists.  No change in appearance of the right lung.
