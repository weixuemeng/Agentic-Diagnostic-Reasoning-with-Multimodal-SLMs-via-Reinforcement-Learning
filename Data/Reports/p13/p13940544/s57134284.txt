                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___ AT 2:01 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post thoracotomy and decortication on
 left now status post removal of two of three chest tubes, assess for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 23:38 and ___
 at 12:53.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest are submitted, ___ at 2:00
 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A single left pleural catheter remains in place.  There continues to be
 near complete opacification of the left mid and lower lung with some aerated
 lung at the left apex.  Given the interval change since ___ at 12:53,
 this most likely represents lobar collapse, although superimposed pneumonia,
 pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration should also be considered.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably
 enlarged.  Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Degenerative changes in the mid thoracic spine with no acute bony
 abnormality appreciated.
