                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is chronic left-sided volume loss from prior left upper lobe
 resection with associated leftward shift of mediastinal structures and
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, unchanged from prior examination.  Heart
 size is difficult to evaluate due to shift of mediastinal structures; however,
 appears within normal limits.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A moderate-sized hiatal
 hernia is again noted, best identified on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic left-sided volume loss from prior upper lobe resection.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality given chronic post-operative changes.
 2.  Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
