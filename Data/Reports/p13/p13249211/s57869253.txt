                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath 
 
 COMPARISON:  CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest.  
 
 Once again identified is left-sided volume loss from the prior left upper
 lobectomy.  There is a leftward shift of the mediastinal structures.  The
 previously seen area of ground-glass with peribronchiolar consolidation on the
 CT appears to be relatively stable given differences in modality from ___.  
 
 A nodular opacity at the right lung base is likely nipple shadow, but can be
 followed on a subsequent exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Given differences in modality, stable findings of left lower lobe
 consolidations since ___. Continued follow up is recommended.
