                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothorax s/p fall. Please perform at 9AM
 // ?interval change, please perform at 9AM
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistence of a small left apical pneumothorax.  The right pleural surfaces
 are normal.  The lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to prior. 
 Increased bibasilar opacities, right > left.  A moderate amount of
 peribronchial coughing likely consistent with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild interstitial edema.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  The mildly displaced lateral left sixth rib fracture is
 not as well visualized as on prior chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistence of small left apical pneumothorax.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.
 3. Worsening bibasilar atelectasis with possible secondary superimposed
 process the in the right lower lobe such as aspiration or developing
 infectious pneumonia.
