                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell cancer with persistent dry cough.  Rule out
 acute process, worsening disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ in conjunction with chest
 CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Compared with the most recent prior radiograph, there is worsening of
 bilateral hilar opacities, consistent with lymphadenopathy seen on prior CT;
 however, more pronounced.  Multiple nodules in the left lower lobe are seen,
 the largest measuring 1.2 x 2.3 cm was not clearly visible on prior chest
 radiograph.  On prior CT, in coronal view, it measured approximately 1.4 x 2.4
 cm in ___.  Other nodules are seen in the left lower lobe which were also
 not seen on prior radiograph, likely corresponding to nodules seen on CT.  The
 left superior mediastinal mass now measures 4.8 x 3 cm, previously on ___, measuring 3.9 x 2.5 cm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute pneumonia.
 2.  Interval progression of disease with increased hilar opacities consistent
 with lymphadenopathy and more prominent pulmonary nodules and left superior
 mediastinal mass.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Telephone notification to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:50
