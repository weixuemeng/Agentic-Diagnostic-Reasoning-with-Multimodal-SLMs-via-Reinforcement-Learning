                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Please evaluate
 for infectious process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated. In addition to basal bronchial wall thickening,
 possibly bronchiectasis, there is the suggestion of developing peribronchial
 inflammation in the right mid lung. The aortic knob is newly obscured, perhaps
 by new mediastinal adenopathy, aortic dissection or consolidation in the
 adjacent lung.  Nipple shadows are prominent and asymmetrically placed,
 perhaps due to chest wall underdevelopment associated with the hypoplastic
 right humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Uncertain findings regarding pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and possible aortic
 dissection or aggressive mediastinal adenopathy warrant prompt CT scanning.
