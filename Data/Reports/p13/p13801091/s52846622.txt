                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 without appreciable vascular congestion.
 
 There has been interval development of a soft tissue collection with air-fluid
 level anteriorly and to the left at the level of the hilum.  This was
 discussed with Dr. ___.  The patient has no symptoms to suggest abscess,
 and this most likely represents a post-surgical benign collection.  If
 clinically necessary, cross-sectional imaging will be obtained.
 
 There is some increased opacification in the right cardiophrenic angle. 
 Although this may well represent merely atelectasis, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
