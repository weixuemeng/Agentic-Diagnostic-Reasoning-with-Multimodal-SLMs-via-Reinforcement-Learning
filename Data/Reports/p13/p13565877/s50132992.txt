                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, now resolved.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Evidence of bilateral pleural and
 diaphragmatic plaques are again seen consistent with prior asbestos exposure. 
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques again seen, consistent with
 the prior asbestos exposure.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
