                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea and epigastric pain  // evaluate heart
 and lungs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior study. This accentuates the size
 of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged. The aorta is
 slightly tortuous. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with
 mild possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement likely present. Diffuse
 calcified pleural plaques limits assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma. There
 are likely patchy opacities in the lung bases reflective of atelectasis.
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears new compared to the
 prior study and may be due to a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques compatible with prior asbestos
 exposure.
 2. Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggests a trace pleural effusion.
