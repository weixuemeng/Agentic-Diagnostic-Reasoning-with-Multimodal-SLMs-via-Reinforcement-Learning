                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate position of central venous line.  The patient has a
 history of ischemic heart disease, chronic renal failure, on hemodialysis,
 baseline right pleural effusion, and congestive heart failure.  The patient is
 presenting from the nursing home with two days of intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest.  There is a right lower
 lobe consolidation and pleural effusion.  There is also likely a component of
 atelectasis given evidence of volume loss.  Severe cardiomegaly is present. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a
 double-lumen left internal jugular hemodialysis catheter terminating within
 the right atrium.  There are multiple left subclavian and axillary arterial
 stents.  Median sternotomy wires are present with surgical clips projecting
 over the spine.  There is an IVC filter which is incompletely imaged in the
 lower aspect of the radiograph.  Bilateral severe degenerative changes of the
 shoulders are present with sclerosis of the left humeral head and near
 bone-on-bone appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Double-lumen central venous line terminates in the right atrium.
 2.  Right lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis with right pleural effusion.
 3.  Severe cardiomegaly.
 4.  No evidence of decompensated congestive heart failure.
