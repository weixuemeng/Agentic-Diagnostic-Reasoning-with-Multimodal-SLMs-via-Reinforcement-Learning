                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous
 with calcification noted along the arch.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  A
 small pleural effusion is suspected on the right, no definite one on the left.
 Streaky opacity along the left costophrenic angle suggests minor atelectasis
 or scarring.  No parenchymal edema is convincingly detected. The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Trace pleural effusion on the right; otherwise unremarkable study.
