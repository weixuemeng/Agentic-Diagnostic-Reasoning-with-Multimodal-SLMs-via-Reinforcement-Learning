                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is evidence of volume loss in the right chest with right apical
 pleuroparenchymal scarring. Suture chained material and multiple surgical
 clips are noted along the right upper mediastinal border suggesting prior lung
 resection. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is mild calcification of
 the aortic knob. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes, predominantly in the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Evidence of prior right lung resection with right apical pleuroparenchymal
 scarring but no prior studies available for comparison.
 2. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
