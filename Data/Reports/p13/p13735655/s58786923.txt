                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough, status post
 adrenalectomy.
 
 STUDY:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size continues to be enlarged, exaggerated by AP
 projection, but similar to most recent prior exam; progressed since more
 remote prior exams.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable.  The
 lungs demonstrate subtle increased interstitial markings, possibly
 representing mild interstitial edema or chronic changes.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion but no pneumothorax.  There is no pulmonary
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with minimal interstitial edema vs. chronic
 interstitial changes; small right pleural effusion.
