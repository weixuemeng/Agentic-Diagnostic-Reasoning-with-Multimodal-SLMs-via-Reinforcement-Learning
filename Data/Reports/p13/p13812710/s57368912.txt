                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history of "walking PNA", has had
 productive cough x2 months.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower causing bronchovascular crowding.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise normal.  On lateral view, increased opacity posterior
 lower lungs may be due to the patient's body habitus.  No correlate is present
 on the frontal view.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity of the posterior lower lungs on lateral view usually
 indicates underlying pathology such as infection, as the classic radiological
 "spine sign."  However, in this case, it may be due to underpenetration of the
 x-ray due to the patient's body habitus.  Oblique radiographic views may be
 helpful for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The above findings were entered by Dr. ___ ___ the
 ___ Imaging Findings Dashboard for communication to the ordering
 clinician at 16:11 on ___.
