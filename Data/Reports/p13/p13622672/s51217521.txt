                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of abdominal distention and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ at 19:56.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is moderate to severely enlarged.  Rightward deviation of the
 trachea due to a large thyroid goiter is noted.  Lung volumes are low.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted, with a focal area fluid loculated in the left major fissure.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large thyroid goiter with rightward deviation of the trachea.  Low lung
 volumes with cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions, mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis
 or infection.
