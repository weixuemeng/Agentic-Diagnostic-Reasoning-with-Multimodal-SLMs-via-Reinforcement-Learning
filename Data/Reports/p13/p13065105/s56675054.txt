                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest demonstrate mild interstitial abnormality
 and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, but no overt pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, and coronary artery
 calcifications and stents are noted.  Median sternotomy wires are noted from
 prior CABG, and there is a single-lead pacemaker superimposed over the left
 chest with lead terminating in the right ventricle.  The left pulmonary artery
 appears enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal
 consolidation is noted. No definite displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Left pulmonary arterial enlargement, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
 3.  No definite displaced rib fracture. If there is continued clinical
 concern, then a dedicated rib series is recommended.
