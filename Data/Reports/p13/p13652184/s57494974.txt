                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:50 P.M. ON ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with bilateral pneumothorax, multiple rib
 fractures.  Evaluate change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 8:20 a.m.:
 
 Small left pleural effusion is larger, left pneumothorax is minimal, if any.
 No right pleural abnormality.  Multiple fractures of posterolateral left
 middle ribs are substantially displaced, perhaps more so now than on the
 earlier examination, putting the patient at risk for lung trauma and bleeding.
 New midline catheter is presumably an epidural infusion device, but the tip is
 not visible.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are normal.
