                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post NG tube placement.  Please assess
 placement of NG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from earlier today
 at 8:00 a.m. and 9:14 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval change in
 position of NG tube which is now seen in standard position along the expected
 course of the esophagus with distal tip projecting towards the fundus of the
 stomach overlying the gastric air bubble.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of
 complication, notably no pneumothorax.  The remainder of the study is
 unchanged from the prior radiographs.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Repositioning of NG tube which is now in appropriate position
 with distal tip in the stomach.  The above findings were communicated to Dr.
