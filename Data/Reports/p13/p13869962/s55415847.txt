                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis with concern for infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views were obtained of the chest.  Bi-apical opacities, which on prior CT
 torso contained calcification, are again seen, with the right apical opacity
 less conspicuous than on the  previous examination because it is either
 resolving or cavitating, best determined by Chest CT.  No new focal opacity is
 identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suggest Chest CT to distinguish resolving from cavitating right
 apical infection.
