                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with acute shortness of
 breath with history of C1-C2 fracture.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Most likely pleural calcifications are
 projecting over the left mid and lower lung in the vertical fashion.  Mild
 vascular engorgement is noted but no overall new consolidation to suggest
 infectious process currently demonstrated, although it potentially might be
 obscured on the left by the pleural abnormalities.
