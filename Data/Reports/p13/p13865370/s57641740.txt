 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:19 PM
  Extremely low lung volumes accentuating the pulmonary vasculature.  Small
  right-sided pleural effusion.  Suggestion of increased retrocardiac density
  could correspond to left base atelectasis or possibly infection.  There is a
  suggestion of increased density projecting over the costovertebral sulcus on
  the lateral view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative hypoxemia.  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis,
 pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes
 and improvement of pulmonary edema.  Again seen is right middle and lower lobe
 collapse which has progressively worsened over the past three days.  A new
 left lower lobe opacity is suspicious for pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Also noted is distension of the stomach and small bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable small left lower lobe pneumonia, less likely atelectasis, new
 over the past three days.
 2.  Right middle lobe and lower lobe collapse, worse over the past three days.
 3.  Improvement of pulmonary edema.
 4.  Distention of the stomach and small bowel warrants clinical evaluation
 and, if necessary,  additional imaging. 
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
