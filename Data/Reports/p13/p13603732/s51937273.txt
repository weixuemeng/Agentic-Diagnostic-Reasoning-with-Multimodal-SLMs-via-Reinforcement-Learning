 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left IJ catheter has been
 removed.  The endotracheal tube and enteric tube are stable.
 Continued opacification at the left base with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm.  This suggests layering pleural fluid with some volume loss in
 the left lower lobe.  The opacification at the right base is decreasing and
 the hemidiaphragm is sharply seen on this side.  No evidence of vascular
 congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
