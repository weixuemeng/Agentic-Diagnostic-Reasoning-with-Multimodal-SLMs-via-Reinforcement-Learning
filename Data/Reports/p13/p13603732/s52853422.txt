                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD and hypoxia  // Pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14 21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right IJ catheter with tip overlying the right atrium.
 
 As before, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.
 
 Compared with the prior study, there is much more pronounced hazy confluent
 opacity in both lungs, consistent with alveolar opacities, with air
 bronchograms noted.  There is new obscuration of the right and left
 costophrenic angles consistent with right-greater-than-left layering pleural
 effusions.  There is probable underlying bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rapid evolution of diffuse bilateral confluent opacities with air
 bronchograms, consistent with an alveolar process.  Given time course, this
 most likely represents pulmonary edema.
 
 Probable small right greater left effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 Cardiomegaly again noted.
