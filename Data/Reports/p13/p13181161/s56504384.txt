 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiogenic shock, IABP on pressors.  //
 evaluate IABP placement (pulled back 1 cm), CVL placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the intraaortic balloon pump has been
 pulled back by approximately 1 cm. The pump is now in correct position. The
 other monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, potentially as a result of decreased ventilatory pressure.
 No evidence of new parenchymal changes, pre-existing pulmonary edema and basal
 areas of atelectasis are unchanged.
