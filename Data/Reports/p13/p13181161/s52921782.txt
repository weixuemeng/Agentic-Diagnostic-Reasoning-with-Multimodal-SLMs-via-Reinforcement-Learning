                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated transfer with right internal jugular
 central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube
 courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach.  Right subclavian
 central venous catheter appears to be malpositioned coursing cephalad into the
 right internal jugular vein. Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter is
 demonstrated with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 unchanged. Heart size is mildly enlarged, increased compared to the previous
 exam. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Widening of the superior mediastinum
 is likely due to supine positioning. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Streaky
 atelectasis is noted in both lung bases, more pronounced on the left. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present, though hazy opacities bilaterally
 in the lungs may suggest small layering pleural effusions. No large
 pneumothorax is identified on this supine image. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Malpositioned central venous catheter with tip coursing cephalad into the
 right internal jugular vein.
 2. Standard position of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 3. Increased size of the cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary edema with
 likely layering bilateral pleural effusions indicate congestive heart failure.
 4. Bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 10:53 AM.
