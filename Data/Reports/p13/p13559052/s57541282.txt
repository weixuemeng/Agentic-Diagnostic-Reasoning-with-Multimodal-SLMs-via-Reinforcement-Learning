                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  External chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 Heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Linear density
 projecting over midline neck is noted, likely reflecting a safety pin which is
 external to the patient.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
