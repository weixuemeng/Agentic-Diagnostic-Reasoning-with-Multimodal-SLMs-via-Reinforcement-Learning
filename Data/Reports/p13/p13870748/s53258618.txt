 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is engorgement of the left central
 vasculature and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings.  Small- moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are seen, increased from prior.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but difficult to fully assess given adjacent basilar
 opacities.  Superiorly there is no confluent consolidation.  Pleural-based
 lesion superiorly on the left is unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.  Dual lead pacing device is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings suggestive of congestive failure with edema and small to moderate
 bilateral effusions.
