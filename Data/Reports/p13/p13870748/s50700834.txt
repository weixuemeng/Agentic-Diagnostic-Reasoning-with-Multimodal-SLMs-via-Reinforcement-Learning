                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___ with SOB  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to patient positioning.  Dual lead
 left-sided pacer device is stable in position.  Bibasilar opacities are seen
 which may be due to pleural effusions and overlying atelectasis but
 consolidations are not excluded.  There is prominence indistinctness of the
 central pulmonary vasculature suggesting congestion.  The cardiac silhouette
 is not well assessed but appears enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.
