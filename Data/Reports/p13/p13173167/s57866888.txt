                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for percutaneous nephrostomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an
 endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach.
 
 Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Bibasilar
 opacification is consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis, more prominent
 on the left.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  No definite pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 There is some increased opacification in the left suprahilar region that could
 represent a developing consolidation.
 
 Dense opacification behind the heart with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm
 is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
