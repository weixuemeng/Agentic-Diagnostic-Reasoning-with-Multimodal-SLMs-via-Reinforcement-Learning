 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. Small hiatal
 hernia is noted. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal peripheral
 opacity is seen within the left mid lung field, a nonspecific finding.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are degenerative changes
 noted in the thoracic spine.

 Nonspecific focal peripheral opacity within the left mid lung field.  This
 could reflect an area of infection or potentially infarction in the correct
 clinical setting.
