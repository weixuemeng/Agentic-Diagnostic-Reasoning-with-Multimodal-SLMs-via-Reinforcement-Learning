                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, stroke, assess tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest provided.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube resides approximately 1.9 cm above the carina.  NG tube
 courses into the left upper quadrant.  Left basal retrocardiac linear density
 is most compatible with atelectasis, though a small component of aspiration is
 not excluded.  Right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unremarkable.  No bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube positioned 1.9 cm above the carina.  Consider slight
 retraction by approximately 1 cm for more optimal positioning.  Left lower
 lobe atelectasis versus small volume aspiration.
