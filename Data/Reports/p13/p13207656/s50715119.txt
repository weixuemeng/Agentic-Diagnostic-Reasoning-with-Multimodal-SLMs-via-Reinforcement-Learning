                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma (unknown
 primary) with pleural effusion.  Assess degree of effusion based on outside
 hospital CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size cannot be assessed with certainty because of overlying pleural and
 pulmonary densities on the right side.  Probably no significant cardiac
 enlargement is present.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  A rounded density with
 an average diameter of close to 5 cm is seen in the right-sided
 paramediastinal position similar as noted on a preceding outside chest
 examination of ___.  Noteworthy is that at that time existing minor
 amount of pleural effusion that just blunted the lateral pleural sinus on the
 right side has now increased and reaches into the minor fissure and is
 increased along the right-sided lateral chest wall.  The lateral view confirms
 this assessment.  The left-sided hemithorax remains unremarkable and that
 includes the normal-appearing pleural space.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Estimate of pleural effusion suggests 500 to 600 mL, provided that the
 densities are only caused by fluid, which in this patient with history of
 metastatic malignancy is questionable..
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderately sized right-sided pleural density that has increased considerably
 since the next preceding outside chest examination dated ___.
