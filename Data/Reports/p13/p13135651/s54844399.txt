 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma after port placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to only prior chest radiograph ___.
 
 Previously less well-defined consolidation in the right lung has grown larger
 in the mid lung, more mass-like and extensive in the lower lung and cavitated
 in the upper lung, all consistent with progressive necrotizing pneumonia. 
 Fullness in the right paratracheal station is most readily explained by
 adenopathy.  The left upper lung is grossly clear, the lower lung may contain
 small cavities.  Heart is normal size but increased since ___.  Small
 right pleural effusion is presumed.  No pneumothorax.  Left subclavian
 infusion port ends in the upper SVC, right IJ line in the lower.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 10 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
