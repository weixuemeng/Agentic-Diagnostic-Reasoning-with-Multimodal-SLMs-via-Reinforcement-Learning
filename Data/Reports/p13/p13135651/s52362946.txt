 supine film.  Multifocal regions of consolidation are seen throughout the
 right lung.  The left lung is grossly clear noting costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.

 of consolidation in the right lung which may represent infection in the proper
 clinical setting, follow up will be necessary.
