                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Unresponsive.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The azygos contour is prominent,
 which may indicate some degree of fluid overload.  The left hemidiaphragm
 appears elevated, which may be a more chronic finding, but possibly due to
 atelectasis and volume loss, otherwise not well assessed.  Small pleural
 effusions are difficult to exclude.  A mild interstitial abnormality suggests
 pulmonary vascular congestion, but not severe.  There is moderate-to-severe
 S-shaped curvature to the thoracolumbar spine.  A large bubble-like lucency
 projecting over the epigastrium may be due to gastric or colonic distention. 
 Bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.  Possible gastric
 or colonic dilatation.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Scoliosis.
