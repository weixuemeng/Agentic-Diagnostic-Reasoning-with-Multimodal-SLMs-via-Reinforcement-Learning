                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 6.4 cm
 from the carina. An enteric tube is new in the interval, which appears to
 course to the level of the diaphragm, though the distal aspect is not well
 assessed. Remainder of the exam is unchanged with continued low lung volumes.
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is again noted. There is unchanged
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded in the left lung base. Small left
 pleural effusion is likely present. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Standard position of the endotracheal tube.  Enteric tube appears to reach the
 level of the diaphragm, though the location of these tip is difficult to
 visualize.  Remainder of the exam is unchanged.
