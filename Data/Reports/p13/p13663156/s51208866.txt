 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Persistent cardiomegaly.  Rapidly improving airspace opacity in the right
 lower lobe, which may have reflected an acute aspiration event given its rapid
 development and improvement.  Worsening area of consolidation in the left
 retrocardiac region may be due to a similar process.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema.
