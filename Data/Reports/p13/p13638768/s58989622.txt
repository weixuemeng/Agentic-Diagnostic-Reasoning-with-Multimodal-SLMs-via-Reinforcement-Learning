                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with right basilar crackles and fever, evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart is normal
 in size and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Lungs are
 symmetrically expanded. There is increased density in the posterior basal
 segment of the left lower lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A nodular
 density projecting over the lateral aspect of the left 3rd rib may be external
 to the patient as a similar density is present on the opposite side. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Increased opacification in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe
 may represent early pneumonia. Follow up radiographs are recommended 4 to 6
 weeks after treatment to assess for resolution. Nodular opacities in upper
 lungs, possibly external to the patient, can also be re-evaluated at that
 time.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:15 am on
 ___ via telephone.
