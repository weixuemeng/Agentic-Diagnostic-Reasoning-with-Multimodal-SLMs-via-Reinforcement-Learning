                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman immunosuppressed from chemo and new hypoxia. 
 Evaluate for hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, semi upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath tip projects over the expected region of the SVC chest right
 junction, unchanged.  Left subclavian approach catheterization tip projects
 over the expected region of the upper-mid SVC, unchanged.  Lung volumes are
 improved in the interim.  The edema is mild.  Hazy opacification of the lower
 lungs suggest basilar atelectasis.  However, subtle increased opacity in the
 right lower lung could reflect a concurrent pneumonia or aspiration, but this
 has been unchanged since ___.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle asymmetric increased opacity in the right lower lobe could reflect
 concurrent pneumonia or aspiration in the appropriate clinical situation,
 however, this has been present and stable since ___
