                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sudden onset of chest pain  // r/o pneumothorax
 or acute pulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates no focal opacity convincing
 for pneumonia.  Streaky peribronchiolar opacities at the bases may reflect
 atelectasis or alternatively possibly atypical pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Left hemidiaphragm is mildly
 elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality. Streaky peribronchiolar opacities at the
 bases may reflect atelectasis or alternatively possibly an atypical pneumonia.
 Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted
 clinically.
