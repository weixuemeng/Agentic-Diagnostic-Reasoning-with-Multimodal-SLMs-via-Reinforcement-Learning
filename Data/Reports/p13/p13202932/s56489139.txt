 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Patchy and linear opacities in the bases
 probably reflect atelectasis, but pneumonia is also possible and followup PA
 and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation when the
 patient's condition allows.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  Tip of vascular catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava
 just above the junction with the right atrium.
