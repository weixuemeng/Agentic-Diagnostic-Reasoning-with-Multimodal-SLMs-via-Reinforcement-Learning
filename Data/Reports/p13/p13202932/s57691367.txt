                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  HIV on HAART, also on chemo with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again there
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Minimal
 basilar atelectasis is seen.  There is no focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
 and unremarkable.  Hilar contours are stable.  Mild basilar atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change.
