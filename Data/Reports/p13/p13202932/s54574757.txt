 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Low lung

 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for lung volumes.  No osseous
 abnormality is identified.  There is no free air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.
