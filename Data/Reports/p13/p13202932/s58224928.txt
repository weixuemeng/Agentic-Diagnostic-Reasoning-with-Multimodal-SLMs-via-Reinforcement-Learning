                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lymphoma status post chemotherapy, not
 neutropenic and now with cough, question infection.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.  
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval improvement in linear opacity within the right middle lobe
 suggestive of resolving atelectasis. There continue to be some streaky
 opacities at both bases, likely reflecting bibasalar atelectasis, although an
 early infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Multiple nodular opacities seen on a recent chest CT of ___
 are not well seen on the plain film study.  Slight prominence of the hilar
 shadows is stable but likely reflects known hilar lymphadenopathy.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
 contour is stable.
