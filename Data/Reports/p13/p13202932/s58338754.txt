                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lymphoma with hypoxia and fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ as well
 as chest CT from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes with
 bilateral multifocal opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones, which
 were seen on PET-CT from ___, but have intervally increased.   There
 is atelectasis of the right middle lobe, with associated volume loss in the
 right lung.  There is a right-sided PICC line, which terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral consolidations predominantly in the lower lungs,
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia, along with right middle lobe atelectasis.
 Follow up radiographs are recommended after treatment to ensure resolution.
