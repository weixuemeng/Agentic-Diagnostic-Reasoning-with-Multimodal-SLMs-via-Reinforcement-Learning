                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with HIV, cough, fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities are most suggestive of consistent with atelectasis in
 the setting of low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 accentuated.  The hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacities probably due to atelectasis in the lower lungs; however an
 infectious etiology cannot be excluded by this study and short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be helpful to assess further if clinically indicated. 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:20 pm on ___.
