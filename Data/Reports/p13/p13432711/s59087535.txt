                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval pulm edeam      eval pulm
 edeam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. As compared to outside chest radiograph
 performed earlier today, there has been interval improvement of linear and
 hazy opacities involving the right hemi thorax.  Given the this rapid interval
 change, findings could be secondary to improving pulmonary edema. There still
 remains pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema,
 right worse than left, and this can be seen in the setting of asymmetric
 pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rapid interval improvement of linear and hazy opacities involving the right
 hemithorax, as compared to outside chest radiograph performed earlier today,
 findings could be secondary to improving pulmonary edema. Pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema still remain, right worse than
 left, this can be seen in the setting of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
