 FINDINGS: 
 
 As on prior, there is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated
 atelectasis at the left lung base. The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation. Slight blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle
 suggests tiny pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. No acute
 osseous abnormalities. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible tiny right pleural effusion. Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
