                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w/ gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP with
 tachycardia and mild hypoxia  // ___ year old woman w/ gallstone pancreatitis
 s/p ERCP with tachycardia and mild hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 A small amount of left pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but the heart does not
 appear frankly enlarged. The mediastinum remains midline. There is platelike
 atelectasis in the right mid zone.
 
 A small (4.3 mm) rounded density in the right upper zone laterally overlying
 the right third anterior most likely represents a calcified granuloma.
 
 The lungs are otherwise clear, without focal infiltrate, CHF, or right pleural
 effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with possible small left
 effusion. Minimal atelectasis right base.
 2. No CHF .
 3. Probable small granuloma right upper zone laterally.
