                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with outside NG tube placement, here for
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CT of same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an enteric tube in
 hairpin loop configuration with tip directed upwards at the level of the
 carina, compatible with malpositioning.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 prominent, likely accentuated by AP technique.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the
 aortic arch.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  An apparent concavity along the
 superolateral aspect of the right humeral head may represent a Hill-___
 deformity due to prior injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Malpositioning of enteric tube, which was subsequently removed
 prior to same day CT performed later in the evening.
