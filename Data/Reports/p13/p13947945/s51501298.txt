                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of uterine cancer now with AMS and
 hypotension  // rule out infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest. Portable semi-erect AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is somewhat rotated in position. Obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm and haziness of the left hemithorax are worrisome for a layering
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation not
 excluded. Patchy right basilar opacity is seen, could be due to atelectasis,
 infection, aspiration, metastatic disease not excluded. There is prominence of
 the interstitial markings bilaterally, unclear whether related to fluid
 overload or chronic disease. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged. The
 aorta likely tortuous.  No pneumothorax is seen. The bones are diffusely
 osteopenic with suggestion of chronic deformities of several left-sided ribs,
 possibly due to prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left pleural effusion, underlying consolidation not excluded. Patchy right
 basilar opacity could be due to pneumonia, aspiration, atelectasis, metastatic
 disease not excluded. Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for
 further evaluation.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Several rib
 deformities may be due to prior trauma.  Suggest comparison with prior
 imaging. Also, suggest repeat when/if patient able, with better patient
 positioning.
