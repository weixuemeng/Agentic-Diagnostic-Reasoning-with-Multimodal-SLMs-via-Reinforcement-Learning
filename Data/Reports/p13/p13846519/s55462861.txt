                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with cough  // r/o acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CT torso from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal opacity seen in the left midlung laterally with fiducial markers
 compatible with known left upper lobe mass and is slightly more conspicuous on
 the current exam. The lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings. No new region of consolidation nor effusion. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications seen at the aortic arch. Chronic deformity of the right humeral
 head is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Known left upper lobe mass with
 fiducial markers is slightly more conspicuous within limitation of differences
 in technique.  CT would offer better detail if desired.
