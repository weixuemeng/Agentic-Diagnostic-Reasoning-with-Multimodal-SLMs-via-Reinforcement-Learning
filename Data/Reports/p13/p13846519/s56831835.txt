                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The aorta is partly calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Patchy right basilar opacity
 suggests minor atelectasis that is similar to perhaps minimally increased. 
 Areas of slight pleural thickening at the right apex appear similar,
 suggesting prior scarring or perhaps minimal pleural plaque formation.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes along the
 thoracic spine are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
