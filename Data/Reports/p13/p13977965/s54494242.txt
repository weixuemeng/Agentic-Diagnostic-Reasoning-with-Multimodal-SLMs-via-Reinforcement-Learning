 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of chronic heart failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, predominating in the middle parts of the lung, persist.  The lung
 volumes remain low.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is within the normal
 range.  There is no evidence of pleural effusions or widening of the vascular
 pedicle, potentially indicative for lung edema.
