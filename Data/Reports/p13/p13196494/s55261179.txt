                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever with left upper and left lower extremity joint pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Further worsening of the previously noted diffuse pulmonary edema
 has ensued consistent with cardiac decompensation.  The cardiomediastinal size
 and configuration remain markedly stable with evidence of prior CABG.  No
 definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of the diffuse pulmonary edema, presumed
 cardiogenic in etiology.  Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate
 diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
