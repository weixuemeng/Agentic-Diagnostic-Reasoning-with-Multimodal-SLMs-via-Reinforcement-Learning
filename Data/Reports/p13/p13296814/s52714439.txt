 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y M with recent diagnosis of laryngeal SCC causing partial
 airway obstruction requiring a tracheostomy by on ___, who was brought
 to the ED from rehab after his trach become dislodged. Trach was replaced by
 ENT in the ED. Transferred to ___ for hypotension, fevers.  // interval

 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously asymmetrically distributed opacification in the right lung base and
 upper lobe has improved, but interstitial abnormality has become considerably
 more extensive in the left lung and there is new consolidation at the base. 
 The findings could be explained by asymmetric distribution of edema, but I
 favor aspiration, clearing from the right lung, now worsening on the left. 
 Generalized hyperinflation is due to obstructive airways disease.  Borderline
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Pleural effusions if present are not large.
