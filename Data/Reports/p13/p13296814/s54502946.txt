                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, COPD, lung and laryngeal masses
 presenting with shortness of breath and cough.  // Please evaluate for
 aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Marked cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and
 diffuse interstitial edema. More confluent areas of opacification overlie the
 lower spine on the lateral view and or also present to a lesser extent in the
 right upper lobe. Small pleural effusions are present, left greater than
 right. Hyper expansion of the lungs is in keeping with history of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Observed findings likely representing combination of congestive heart failure
 and aspiration pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful
 in distinguishing the contribution of each process to the observed
 abnormalities.
