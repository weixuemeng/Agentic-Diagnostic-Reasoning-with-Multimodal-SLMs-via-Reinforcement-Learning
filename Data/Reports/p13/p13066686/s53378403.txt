 INDICATION:   ___M with dyspnea  // pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Irregular interstitial markings and increased
 lucency projecting over the upper lungs suggest underlying COPD.  Blunting of
 the posterior costophrenic angles may be due to small effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities, hypertrophic changes are seen the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation with changes suggestive of COPD as well as probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
