                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A rounded nodular
 opacity projects over the left upper lung on the first of four images, which
 measures ___ x 15 mm.  There is poorly defined increased peribronchovascular
 opacity in the lower lungs bilaterally which could represent an early
 bronchopneumonia.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  There is convex bulge
 along the right mediastinal border concerning for lymphadenopathy.  Mild hilar
 prominence is also noted which could be due to bronchovascular crowding.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mediastinal prominence, concerning for lymphadenopathy.  Left upper lobe
 pulmonary nodule measuring 16 mm.  Findings are concerning for possible
 malignancy and therefore CT is recommended to further assess.
 
 2. Subtle bronchovascular opacities in the lower lungs could represent
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  This can also be further assessed
 at the time of CT.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ at the time of
 this dictation.
