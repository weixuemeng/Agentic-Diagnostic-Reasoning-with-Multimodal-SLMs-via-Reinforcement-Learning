                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with tracheobronchial malacia, initially noted
 ___ but with symptoms since age ___m, s/p recent tracheobronchoplasty, with
 chest tubes now removed; evaluate for interval changes in lungs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior exam, the linear lucency along the apex of the right
 lung appears similar in size but now demonstrates an air-fluid level, which is
 consistent with a hydropneumothorax. Mild, linear opacity consistent with
 atelectasis at the right lung base. Otherwise, the lungs are expanded and
 clear. There is no pleural effusion or focal consolidation. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. The supraclavicular
 subcutaneous emphysema is slightly improved from the prior exam. Multiple old
 left-sided rib fractures with callus formation and mild, multi-level
 degenerative changes in the visualized thoracic spine are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right apicolateral hydropneumothorax.
 
 Slight interval improvement in right supraclavicular subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 Mild right basilar atelectasis.
