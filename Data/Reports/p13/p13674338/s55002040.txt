                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ventricular ectopy, on amiodarone, assess for toxicity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest.  The lungs are well expanded with bilateral
 basal left greater than right linear opacities consistent with bronchial wall
 thickening and bronchiectasis seen on the prior CT, likely reflecting
 chronic/recurrent aspiration.  Left mid lung nodule is better depicted on the
 prior CT from ___.  Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable with
 post-CABG changes noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process or finding to suggest amiodarone
 toxicity.  Basal linear opacities are consistent with bronchiectasis
 suggesting recurrent aspiration.
 
 Left mid lung nodule, better seen on prior CT which previously recommended
 followup CT evaluation in ___.
