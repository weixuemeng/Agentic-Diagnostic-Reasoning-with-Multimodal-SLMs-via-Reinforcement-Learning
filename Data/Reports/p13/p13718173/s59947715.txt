                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe AF from leukocytosis, question pulmonary edema, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, there has been a marked change in the radiographic
 appearance.  There are now diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both
 lungs, with upper zone redistribution.  No gross right and no definite left
 effusion.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen.  
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with cardiomegaly and a left
 ventricular configuration as well as a prosthetic valve.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette may be very slightly more prominent, though
 likely also accentuated by differences in technique. 
 
 A right-sided central line is present, tip over proximal SVC, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development (over one day) of increased interstitial and alveolar
 opacities in both lungs with upper zone redistribution.  This most likely
 represents CHF, given the rapidity of development.
 
 2.  Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The possibility
 of a pneumonic infiltrate associated with this cannot be excluded.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at
 2:50 p.m. on the day of the exam (___, phone).
