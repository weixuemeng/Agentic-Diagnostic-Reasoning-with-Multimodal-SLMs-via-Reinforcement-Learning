 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post redo sternotomy.  Evaluation for nasogastric tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:10 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 Dobbhoff catheter.  The Dobbhoff catheter is in correct position.  The tip is
 pointed towards the gastroesophageal junction and projects over the proximal
 parts of the stomach.  The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged
 in appearance.  The pre-described small left pneumothorax is not visible on
 the current image, given that the lung apices are not included.
