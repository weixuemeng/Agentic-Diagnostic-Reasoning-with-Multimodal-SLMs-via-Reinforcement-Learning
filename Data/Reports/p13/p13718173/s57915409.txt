                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mechanical AVR, left apical
 pneumothorax with chest tube on waterseal.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 8:23 and ___ at 10:10.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A right internal jugular large-bore catheter and feeding tube are unchanged in
 position.  A left basilar chest tube remains in place.  A left subclavian
 introducer is also unchanged.  There is a stable small left apicolateral
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post
 median sternotomy with CABG.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely reflecting a small effusion and/or pleural thickening.  Streaky patchy
 opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects resolving partial lower
 lobe atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
