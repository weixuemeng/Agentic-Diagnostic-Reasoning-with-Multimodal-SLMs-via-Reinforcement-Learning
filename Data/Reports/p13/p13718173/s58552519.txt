                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with new hypoxia and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with radiograph performed approximately 9 days ago there has been
 interval development of a right lower lobe opacity, with obscuration of the
 right heart border. There is a small amount of layering pleural effusion with
 some fluid within the minor fissure.  On the left there is a small pleural
 effusion. A vague small opacity is seen in the left upper lung which appears
 new from prior. There is increased vascular congestion and interstitial
 markings bilaterally. Right-sided central line ends in the right atrium as
 before. Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle and potentially lower lobe pneumonia on the background of
 worsening vascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema.  Followup
 after treatment is suggested.
