                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed since the prior study.
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of the mid SVC and
 unchanged.  The right lung is clear. There is a retrocardiac opacity at the
 base of the left lung, which is similar in appearance to the prior study. The
 heart is enlarged and the hilar contours are normal.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax. There is a very small left pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left lower lobe consolidation, persistent over 3 days, could represent
 pneumonia or lobar collapse.
