 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis with small residual pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the small right apical pneumothorax.  However, there is
 increasing opacification at the right base, which could reflect any
 combination of increasing effusion, volume loss, or even supervening
 pneumonia.
