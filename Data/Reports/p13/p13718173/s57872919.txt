                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomegaly is accompanied by persistent widespread interstitial
 edema.  More confluent opacities at the lung bases are present, and have
 markedly progressed in the left lower lobe in the interval.  It is uncertain
 whether this represents dependent pulmonary edema or a superimposed process
 such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.  Followup radiographs
 after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.  Moderate left pleural effusion
 has increased in size since the prior study.  There is no visible
 pneumothorax.
