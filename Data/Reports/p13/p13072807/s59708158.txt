                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with intubation, assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was read in comparison with the prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube ends approximately 1.7 cm above the carina with
 the patient's neck in flexed position.  Consider retracting the endotracheal
 tube for additional 2 cm for better seating.  An orogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm and ends into the stomach with the loop with its
 tip pointing towards the fundus.  A right internal jugular line tip lies at
 lower SVC.  Both lung volumes are low.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 unchanged.  Bilateral lower lung opacities, left side more than right reflects
 right lower lung atelectasis and a combination of mild-to-moderate pleural
 effusion and left lower lung atelectasis, unchanged over last 24 hours.
