 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY: Difficult mechanical ventilation.  
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-upright AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is again high-lying, lying about 9 cm above
 the carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Superimposed on bibasilar
 opacities, left greater than right, as seen previously, is an increasing hazy
 perihilar abnormality with peribronchial cuffing, suggestive of fluid
 overload, but etiologies such as rapidly developing infection or acute
 respiratory distress syndrome could also be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increasing predominantly perihilar opacification, suggesting
 pulmonary congestion versus other etiologies such as diffuse rapidly
 progressive infection or respiratory distress syndrome.  High-lying
 endotracheal tube, which could be advanced somewhat if clinically indicated.
