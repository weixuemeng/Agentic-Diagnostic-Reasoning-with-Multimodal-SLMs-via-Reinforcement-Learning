                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with IVH, pneumonia,
 and large right pleural effusion, now status post thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 6 hr prior on the same day,
 as well as ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube in the
 mid to lower thoracic trachea, left approach central line with the tip in the
 low SVC, and nasoenteric tube coursing below the diaphragm and off the
 inferior edge of the image.
 
 There has been interval resolution of a right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild pulmonary edema is greater on the right than
 left. Bibasilar consolidations could represent atelectasis, but a superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval resolution of right pleural effusion after thoracentesis, without
 pneumothorax.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left.
 3. Persistent bibasilar consolidations.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  A preliminary reading was provided, upon request, via telephone
 by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 10:45 on ___.
