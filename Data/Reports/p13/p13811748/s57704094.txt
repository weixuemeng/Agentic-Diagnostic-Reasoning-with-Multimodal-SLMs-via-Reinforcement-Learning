                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour is slightly widened,
 but stable from prior exams, and likely due to a tortuous aorta an overlying
 vessels.  The heart size is normal.  There are multiple compression
 deformities in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.  One of the more
 prominent ones appears stable, while one exhibits a slight increase in the
 loss of height.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Multiple compression deformities; one of which exhibits slight interval
 increase in the loss of height, although is of otherwise of uncertain age.
