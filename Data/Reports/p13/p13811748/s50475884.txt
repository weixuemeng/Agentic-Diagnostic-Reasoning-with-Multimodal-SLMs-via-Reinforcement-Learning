                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 History of congestive heart failure with 3 days of worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with mild atherosclerotic calcification noted diffusely within the
 thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal patchy
 opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities demonstrated. L1 compression fracture is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
