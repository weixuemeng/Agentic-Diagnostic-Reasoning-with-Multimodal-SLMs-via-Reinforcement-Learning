                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Evaluate for fracture. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is top normal with tortuosity of the thoracic
 aortic arch.  Prominent central vasculature is suggestive of mild fluid
 overload.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There are trace pleural effusions
 bilaterally, seen layering posteriorly on the lateral view.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No distracted rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Mild fluid overload with trace pleural effusions.
 2.  No distracted rib fracture.  If there is a focal area of concern,
 dedicated rib series may be helpful.
