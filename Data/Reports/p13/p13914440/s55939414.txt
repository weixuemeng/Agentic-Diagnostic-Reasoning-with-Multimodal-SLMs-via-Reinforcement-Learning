  Right upper lobe opacity worrisome for atelectasis and less likely pneumonia.
  Followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended for resolution.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph frontal lateral views.
 
 INDICATION:  Cough tachycardia. Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged. Of note, there is a hazy
 somewhat triangular opacity centered in the anterior segment of the right
 upper lobe, abutting the minor fissure which appears very slightly retracted.
 Otherwise, no focal opacity and no frank consolidation identified. This
 opacity partially obscures the right hilum, but otherwise, the hilar contours
 are grossly unremarkable. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt
 CHF. No effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Mild right convex curvature of the thoracic spine and background degenerative
 changes noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right upper lobe opacity suggestive of atelectasis. Early pneumonia is a
 less likely consideration but cannot be entirely excluded. Resultant partial
 obscuration of the right hilum noted. If clinically indicated, followup
 imaging to assess for evolution is recommended.
 2. In addition, followup chest radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended for
 resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 9:21 AM
