                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph provided.  
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Pathcy opacities are present bilaterally which may
 represent atelectasis or early infection.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits, except for minimal unfolding of the aorta.  Incidental
 note is made of bilateral carotid artery calcifications and what appears to be
 an old  fracture of the right proximal humerus, incompletely evaluated on
 these views.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) No gross consolidation.  However, slight, patchy prominence of the
 interstitial markings bilaterally, which may represent either atelectasis or
 early pneumonic infiltrates.
 
 2) Bilateral carotid artery calcification, an unusual finding in someone of
 this age. Clinical correlation requested.
 
 3) Apparent old right proximal humeral fracture, not fully evaluated on these
 views.
