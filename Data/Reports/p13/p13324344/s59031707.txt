                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute alcoholic hepatitis, now status post Dobbhoff placement. 
 Please assess positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of enteric catheter and replacement with a
 Dobbhoff catheter whose tip is likely in the fundus of the stomach; however,
 the radiopaque portion is within the gastroesophageal junction and recommend
 advancing several centimeters.
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina.  Right-sided central
 venous catheter terminates in the right upper atrium.  There is stable
 extensive perihilar opacification, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 opacifications are likely a combination of atelectasis and bilateral pleural
 effusions, not significantly changed from prior.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Distal Dobbhoff tip positioned within the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Recommend advancing several centimeters.  Stable pulmonary edema.
