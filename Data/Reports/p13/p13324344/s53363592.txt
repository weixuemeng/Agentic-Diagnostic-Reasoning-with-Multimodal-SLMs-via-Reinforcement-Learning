                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 Dobbhoff tube have been removed.  Diffuse prominence of coarse interstitial
 markings persists, consistent with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.  Volume
 loss in the left lower lobe with associated effusion again seen, probably with
 a small right effusion as well.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia is
 difficult to exclude on this study given the extensive changes in the lung.
