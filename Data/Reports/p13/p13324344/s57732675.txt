                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Citrobacter pneumonia and pulmonary edema with
 persistent symptoms and leukocytosis despite diuresis and antibiotics.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is again
 seen, unchanged in position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 a persistent small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  There
 may be a trace right pleural effusion.  The previously seen coarse bilateral
 interstitial markings have decreased in prominence in the interval, although
 do remain similar to prior.  There is slightly increased opacity in the region
 of the right lung base which may relate to pulmonary edema, although
 superimposed infectious process is not excluded.  There is varus angulation of
 the right humeral head due to a prior humeral neck fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Interval
 decrease in conspicuity of diffuse prominence of coarse interstitial markings.
 Slight area of opacity at the right lower lung appears improved as compared to
 priors and may relate to pulmonary edema, however, superimposed infection is
 difficult to exclude.
