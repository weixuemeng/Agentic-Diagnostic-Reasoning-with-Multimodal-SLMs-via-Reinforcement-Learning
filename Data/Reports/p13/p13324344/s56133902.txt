                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New intubation, ET tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ earlier the same day.
 
 Compared with the earlier film, a right IJ central line, ETT, and NGT have
 been placed. The right IJ line tip lies in the region of the SVC/RA junction. 
 The ET tube tip is in satisfactory position approximately 3.6 cm above the
 carina. The NG tube tip overlies the expected site of stomach.  
 
 Heart size is borderline allowing for technique.  There is slight upper zone
 re-distribution and slight patchy prominence of the interstitial markings.
 Slightly more confluent opacity along the right chest wall inferiorly.
 Otherwise, no focal consolidation or effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Interval placement of lines and tubes, as described.  Clinical correlation
 regarding possible slight retraction of the right IJ line is requested.  
 
 2.  Continued slight patchy increase of interstitial markings, with slightly
 more confluent opacity along the right chest wall inferiorly.  As before, the
 differential diagnosis includes atelectasis and early infiltrate.
