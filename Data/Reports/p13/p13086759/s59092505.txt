                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with epigastric pain, to rule out hiatal hernia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  There is no evidence of a large hiatal hernia on this radiograph.
 The lung volumes are low, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Linear atelectasis is seen in the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Within the limitations of the study, no large hiatal hernia is
 detected.
