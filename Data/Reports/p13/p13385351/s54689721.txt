                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with tachycardia, fatigue, low BP.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Evaluation is limited due
 to low lung volumes and suboptimal penetration on the lateral view. 
 Additionally, the patient's chin obscures the superior mediastinum and left
 lung apex on the frontal projection.  Allowing for these limitations, there is
 mild left basal atelectasis.  No convincing signs of edema or pneumonia. 
 Heart size and mediastinal contour suboptimally assessed given technical
 limitations.  No osseous abnormalities are detected.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with mild left basal atelectasis.  No overt signs of edema or
 pneumonia.
