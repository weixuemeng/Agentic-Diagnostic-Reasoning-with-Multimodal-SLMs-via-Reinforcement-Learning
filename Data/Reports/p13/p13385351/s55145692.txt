                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hyperglycemia  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is slightly rotated.  The lateral view is suboptimal due to
 underpenetration from overlying soft tissue/body habitus.  Streaky left base
 opacity most likely represents combination of vascular crowding and
 atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Limited lateral view.  Streaky left base opacity most
 likely represents combination of vascular crowding and atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.
