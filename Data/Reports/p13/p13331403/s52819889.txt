                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with rhonchi in the right
 base and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is substantial interval increase in the right
 pleural effusion which is in part loculated.  There is also presence of the
 left basal consolidation that might reflect atelectasis or infectious process.
 Left basal opacity has improved on the other hand.  Apices and the upper lungs
 are essentially clear except for minimal focal opacity at the left upper/mid
 lung, unclear if present on the prior examinations, attention on the
 subsequent study to that area is also required.
