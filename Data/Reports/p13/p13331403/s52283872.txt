  Lung volumes are lower than on the prior examination with accompanying
  bibasilar atelectasis.  Right basal chest tube is likely unchanged allowing
  for differences in projection and lung volumes.  No acute process to explain
  the patient's pain.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube with severe pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again a right
 pigtail catheter in place but no evidence of pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes
 persist.  Areas of opacification are seen at both bases, increasing in
 severity on the left, most likely reflecting atelectasis.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
