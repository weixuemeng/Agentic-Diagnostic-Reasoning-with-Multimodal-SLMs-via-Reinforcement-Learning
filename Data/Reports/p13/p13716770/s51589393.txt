                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior chest radiograph from ___.  Because of the poor inspiratory
 effort, evaluation was somewhat limited.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Minimal opacity in the right infrahilar region could be due to atelectasis
 from suboptimal inspiratory effort or may represent infection. Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild right infrahilar opacity may be atelectasis due to
 suboptimal inspiratory effort or may represent infection.  I recommend to
 repeat chest radiograph with good inspiratory effort to further resolve this
 finding.
