                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Depression, anxiety, palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  This limits the assessment of the lung bases where
 patchy opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  The
 lateral view suggests no focal consolidation however.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is
 seen.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities on the frontal view, likely reflect atelectasis, as no
 consolidative opacity is seen on the lateral view, though infection is not
 completely excluded.
