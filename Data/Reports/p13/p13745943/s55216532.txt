                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-surgery, to assess for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are low lung volumes with bibasilar
 opacification consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. 
 Especially on the right, the possibility of consolidation would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  Dilated loops of small bowel are seen, as
 on the recent CT examination.
