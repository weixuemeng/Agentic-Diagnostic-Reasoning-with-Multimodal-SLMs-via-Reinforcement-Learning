                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of vascular catheter with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Asymmetrical area of consolidation in the right
 infrahilar region could reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema or secondary
 process such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
