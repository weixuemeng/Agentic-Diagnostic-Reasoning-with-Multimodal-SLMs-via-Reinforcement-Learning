 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTA chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 There is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis secondary to low lung volumes.  No
 focal opacity is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hila contours

 nodules are not clearly seen and better assessed on CTA chest from ___.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the caval atrial junction. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
