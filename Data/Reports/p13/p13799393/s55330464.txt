                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:09 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3.5 cm above the carina in
 standard placement.  Orogastric tube ends in the lower portion of the
 minimally distended stomach.  A component of right pleural effusion has
 increased substantially since ___, obscuring the focal lesion in the
 right lower chest, which could be a mass, abscess or even loculated empyema.
 Less pronounced abnormality at the base of the left lung could be a second
 region of the same process(es).  I would strongly recommend CT scanning with
 intravenous contrast agent and, if necessary gravitational maneuvers to
 determine what this is.
 
 
 Pulmonary vascular engorgement is mild.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Heart
 size is normal.
 
 Findings and the recommendation for CT scanning were discussed by telephone
 with the patient's nurse at 8:30 a.m. with a request that the information be
 passed to his physicians.
