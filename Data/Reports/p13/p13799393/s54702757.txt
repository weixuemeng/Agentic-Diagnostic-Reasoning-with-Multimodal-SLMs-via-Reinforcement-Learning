                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased white blood cell count and seizure.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval extubation.  Heterogeneous opacities in the
 right lower lung are not significantly changed, seen to represent pneumonia on
 prior CT from ___.  A new nodular opacity in the right
 mid-to-upper lung could reflect a new focus of infection.  There is
 subsegmental left retrocardiac atelectasis, as before.  No definite pleural
 effusions are seen on these radiographs, although small bilateral pleural
 effusion, right greater than left, are present on prior CT from ___.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 Previously seen left lower lung, band-like atelectasis has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent infection in the right lower lobe with a possible new focus of
 infection in the right mid-to-upper lung.
 
 2.  Interval extubation.
