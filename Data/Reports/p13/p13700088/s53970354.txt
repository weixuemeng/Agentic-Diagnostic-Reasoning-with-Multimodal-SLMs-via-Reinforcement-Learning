                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:05 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Intubated for hypercarbia.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  An AP chest performed with the patient rotated severely to the
 right, excludes lateral right lower chest.  It shows moderate left pleural
 effusion stable or increased since ___, but improvement in pulmonary
 vascular engorgement and mild edema.  Severe right lower lobe atelectasis is
 presumed and the volume of right pleural effusion cannot be assessed.  There
 is no pneumothorax seen along the imaged pleural surfaces.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.  Right central venous line ends low in the SVC and a
 nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Heart is not
 appreciably enlarged, but difficult to compare with prior images.
