                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size appears moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinum demonstrates tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 There is perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema.  Hazy opacities in both lung bases likely reflect small
 layering bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No large pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
