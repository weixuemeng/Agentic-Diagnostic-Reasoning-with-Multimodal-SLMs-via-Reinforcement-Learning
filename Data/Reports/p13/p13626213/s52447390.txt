                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.  Lateral
 radiograph is limited by suboptimal positioning of the patient's arms,
 resulting in obscuration of the normally clear retrosternal space.  If
 warranted clinically, this view could be repeated at no additional charge.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Technically limited chest radiograph demonstrating no acute
 cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.
