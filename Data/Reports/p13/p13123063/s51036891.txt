                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged. The aorta is tortuous, and prominence of
 the aortic knob may partially be due to the presence of an aberrant right
 subclavian artery. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to
 low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are
 demonstrated in the lung bases, more pronounced on the right which appear
 somewhat linear in configuration. These likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities. A common bile duct stent is partially imaged in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis, particularly on the right
 which has a more linear configuration.
