                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  Subsequent review of the lateral projection radiograph again
 demonstrates bibasilar airspace opacities, likely representing atelectasis
 versus pneumonia.  There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 which could reflect small effusions.  The report is otherwise unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with rales, DOE  // evaluate for fluid overload,
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, CT abdomen and pelvis
 dated ___. .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities, more significant on the left, correlate with
 consolidation seen on recent CT abdomen and pelvis examination. The thoracic
 aorta is tortuous and partially calcified. Cardiac size is within normal
 limits.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or large effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, suggestive of atelectasis
 or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
