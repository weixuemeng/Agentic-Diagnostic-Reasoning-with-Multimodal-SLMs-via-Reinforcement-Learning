                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.  Linear opacity within the lingula is compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring.  Ill-defined focal opacity within the right mid lung
 field is not well localized on the lateral view, and could reflect an area of
 atelectasis, but a focus of infection or inflammation cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Ill-defined focal opacity within the right mid lung field.  This could reflect
 an area of atelectasis but infection or inflammation cannot be excluded.
