                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right IJ central venous line placement, here to evaluate line
 positioning.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed earlier the same day at 10:51. 
 
 Technique:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is been interval placement of the right IJ central venous catheter with
 the tip terminating in the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is unchanged in
 position with the tip terminating 5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of few on this image.  The
 inspiratory lung volumes are improved from the most recent prior study. 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities are redemonstrated.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The heart is top normal in size with
 calcification of the mitral valve annulus again noted.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and unchanged. There multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central venous catheter with tip in the mid SVC. 
 2.  Bilateral perihilar opacities may represent centralized pulmonary edema
 or, less likely, bilateral pneumonia.
