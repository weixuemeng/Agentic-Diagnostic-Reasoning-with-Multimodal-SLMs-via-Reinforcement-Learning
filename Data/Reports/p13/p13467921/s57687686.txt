 basilar opacity is noted, which likely represents atelectasis.  In addition, a
 new right infrahilar opacity is noted, which may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right infrahilar opacity may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 context.
