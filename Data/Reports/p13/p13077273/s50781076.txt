                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged.  The hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Focal convexity of the right mediastinal contour could reflect underlying
 lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Consolidative
 opacities within both lung bases are concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration with
 probable small bilateral pleural effusions.  Prominence of the right
 mediastinal contour could relate to lymphadenopathy.  Follow up radiographs
 after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of these findings.
