 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with epigastric pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Chronic
 fibrotic changes with bronchiectasis are again noted at the lung bases, with
 minimal chronic interstitial abnormality also seen along the periphery of both
 lungs, not significantly changed in the interval.  No new focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic fibrotic changes most pronounced at the lung bases without new focal
 consolidation.
