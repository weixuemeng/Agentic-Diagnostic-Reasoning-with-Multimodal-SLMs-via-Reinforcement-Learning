                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pancreatitis and pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the patient in
 an upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
 severe bibasilar atelectasis persist.  Upper lobe vascular congestion could be
 physiologic given severe atelectasis and small pleural effusions. Heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Enteric catheter courses below the
 diaphragm with tip projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely in the
 distal duodenum.  Right PICC appears similarly positioned.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with persistent small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 and severe bibasilar atelectasis.
