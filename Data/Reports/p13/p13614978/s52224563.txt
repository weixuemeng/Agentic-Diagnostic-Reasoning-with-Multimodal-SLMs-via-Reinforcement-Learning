                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, right wrist pain, swelling, ecchymosis, question pulmonary
 infiltration.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated with ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Dense calcification of the annulus is incidentally
 noted.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle is noted posteriorly, without other
 evidence of effusion.  There is possible minimal atelectasis in the right
 middle lobe.  No focal consolidation is identified.   No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 Background osteopenia and degenerative change is noted.  Probable loss of
 height of some lower thoracic and  of the L1 vertebral body, not well
 visualized due to background osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) Minimal blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle.  Upper zone
 redistribution.  No focal infiltrate identified.
 2) Probable multilevel vertebral body compressions, of indeterminate acuity.
 Please see comment above.
