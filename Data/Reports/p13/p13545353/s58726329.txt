 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 23:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The multiple right sided posterior rib fractures are again seen. The
 previously seen small right apical pneumothorax on the cervical spine CT is
 not appreciated on this plain radiograph. The heart remains mildly enlarged. 
 The lungs are low in volumes but without focal airspace consolidation. The
 patchy opacity in the right upper lung has resolved suggesting that it
 represented atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Marked colonic gas
 shows distension.
