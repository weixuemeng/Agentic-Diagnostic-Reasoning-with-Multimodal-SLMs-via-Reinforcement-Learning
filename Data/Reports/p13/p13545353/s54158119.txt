 be any significant interval change. There are stable patchy bibasilar
 opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded. No definite new airspace consolidation is
 appreciated. The heart remains enlarged. There continues to be prominent
 colonic distention.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm but the tip is not identified.
