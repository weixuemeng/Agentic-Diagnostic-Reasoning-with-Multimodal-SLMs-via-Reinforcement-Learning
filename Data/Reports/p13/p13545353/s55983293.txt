                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with sob.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate cardiomegaly and results in crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Left lower lobe consolidation appears worse
 compared to 10 days prior.
 
 Significant gaseous distention of visualized loops of large bowel is
 essentially unchanged.  Incidental note is made of mild bilateral
 acromioclavicular degenerative changes.  Old posterior right rib fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left lower lobe consolidations are concerning for infection, alternatively
 atelectasis.
 2. Significant gaseous distention of visualized loops of large bowel is
 unchanged.
