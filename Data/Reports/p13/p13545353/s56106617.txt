                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with likely aspiration pneumonia, hypoxia  // ?
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 a left ventricular predominance is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Retrocardiac opacification is not substantially changed in the interval, and
 could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Remote right-sided rib
 fractures are again noted.  Diffuse gaseous distention of bowel loops within
 the upper abdomen are similar to the previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with persistent retrocardiac opacity, possibly atelectasis,
 though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. Marked
 gaseous distention of bowel loops in the upper abdomen, as seen previously.
