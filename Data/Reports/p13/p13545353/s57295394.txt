                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with poor swallowing  // dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17 47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 3 separate AP views of the chest are presented.  On view # 3, the radiopaque
 portion of the Dobbhoff tip lies beneath the diaphragm.  It is difficult to
 confirm that this is extended beyond the GE junction based on the available
 view.  There is considerable distention of large and small bowel loops, which
 has been previously investigated.
 
 The heart is enlarged,, but unchanged No overt CHF frank consolidation or
 gross effusion is identified.
 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, not significantly changed. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and some patchy opacity in
 the right cardiophrenic region are similar to the prior film.
 
 Old healed right posterior rib fractures noted.
 
 Incidental note is made of partially imaged spinal fusion hardware and a IVC
 filter centered over the midline.  (in the IVC based on ___ CT
 scan).
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dobbhoff tip lies beneath the diaphragm on the final image.  Whether it is
 passed beyond the GE junction cannot be confirmed.
 
 Extensive bowel distention again noted.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  Minimal
 patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region is also similar to prior.
