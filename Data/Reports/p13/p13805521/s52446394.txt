                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large consolidation is seen overlying the right lung, likely
 involving the upper, middle and lower lobes.  There is also patchy opacity
 involving the left upper lobe, lingula and left lower lobe to a lesser extent
 as compared to the right.  Findings are worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen, although there is subtle blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and trace right pleural effusion is difficult to
 exclude.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral multifocal opacities worrisome for multifocal
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.
