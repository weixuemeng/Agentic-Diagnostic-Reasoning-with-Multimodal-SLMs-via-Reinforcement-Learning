                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, dyspnea, history of HIV, question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 relatively hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  There is minimal loss of height of the mid thoracic
 vertebral body superior endplate, which is likely stable since the prior
 study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
