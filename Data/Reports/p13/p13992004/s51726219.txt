                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, lethargy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mild to moderately enlarged. Dense mitral
 annular calcifications are noted.  The aorta is diffusely calcified. 
 Prominence of the hila is compatible with known lymphadenopathy, and known
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not well depicted on this exam.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, persist.  Opacification
 of the left lung base may reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.  Mild right basilar opacity also may reflect atelectasis.  No
 Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema is seen.  Right lateral pleural
 thickening is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right.  
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities, left more so than right ,may reflect
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
 
 3. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy better assessed on prior
 cross-sectional imaging.
