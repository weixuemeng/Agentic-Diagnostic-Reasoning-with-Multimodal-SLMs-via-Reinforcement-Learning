                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE swelling, low saturations, evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia or PE
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in moderate cardiomegaly particularly of the
 right cardiac silhouette, giving a globular configuration. The previously seen
 dense opacification at the right lung base has improved. There is persistent
 moderate interstitial edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Calcifications at the aortic knob as well as the mitral valve annulus are
 again noted. There is no pneumothorax. Visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval increased in cardiac silhouette, which may be due to worsening
 right-sided heart failure versus pericardial effusion. Correlation with
 echocardiogram is recommended.
 
 2. Interval improvement in the right lung base opacity. No new consolidation
 identified.
 
 3. Unchanged moderate interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions
