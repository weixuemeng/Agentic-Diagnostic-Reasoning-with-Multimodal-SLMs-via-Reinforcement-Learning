                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph there is significant interval improvement
 of previously of lobular enlarged appearance of the heart. However there is
 new opacification of the right lower lung, likely combination of
 consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion. There are also patchy
 opacities in the left upper lobe on the background of diffuse increased
 interstitial thickening and vascular congestion. The aorta is calcified as
 before. Cardiac size cannot be properly assessed in this AP exam. Severe
 mitral annular calcifications are present, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right lower lobe pneumonia with associated right pleural effusion on the
 background of vascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Significant interval improvement of previous enlarged globular appearance
 of the heart.
