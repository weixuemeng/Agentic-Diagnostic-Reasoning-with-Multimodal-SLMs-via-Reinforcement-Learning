                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with unwitnessed fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is again seen.  Calcification in the
 aortic knob and mitral valve annulus are again noted.  Right pleural
 thickening is stable in appearance, and likely represents scarring.  There is
 a small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Increased
 interstitial markings with more dense opacification of the right lung base is
 consistent with infection.  Additionally, there are several nodular opacities
 projecting over the lingula, which may also be infectious in etiology. No
 nondisplaced rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion with multiple new densities and
 increased interstitial markings throughout, concerning for a multifocal
 infectious process with superimposed mild pulmonary edema.
