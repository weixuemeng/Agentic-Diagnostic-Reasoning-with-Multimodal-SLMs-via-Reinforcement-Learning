                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right PICC continues to terminate in the right atrium.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Lungs are clear except for linear
 atelectasis or scarring at the right lung base.  Known subcentimeter pulmonary
 nodules shown on recent CT are likely below the resolution of conventional
 chest radiographs.
