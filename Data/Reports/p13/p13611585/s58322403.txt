 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain radiating to L back  // Please eval
 for any PNA, cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle apparent fibrotic changes in the medial right upper lung seen on the
 frontal view versus external artifact. No definite acute focal consolidation
 is seen. Areas of subcentimeter rounded calcification projecting over the
 right mid to lower lung most likely reflect calcified granulomas. Minor left
 basilar atelectasis is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
