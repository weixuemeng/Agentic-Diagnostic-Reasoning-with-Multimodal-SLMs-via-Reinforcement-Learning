                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M w/ h/o asthma (no prior intubations no prior admissions
 for asthma), p/w 4 days URI symptoms and worsening dyspnea. Today at work was
 very short of breath so he got checked out. He reports that he has never felt
 short of breath in the past. He denies chest pain, fevers, abdominal pain,
 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or additional complaints.  // eval for pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable radiograph of the chest obtained at 14:00
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph obtained earlier at 10:23 on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderately well inflated lungs with unchanged diffuse interstitial edema. 
 Previously noted increased lucency at the left costophrenic angle is
 unchanged, in appearance compared to the prior radiograph obtained earlier on
 the same day.  Given that there is no apical pneumothorax on this upright view
 - this may represent a summation shadow or a loculated pocket of air rather
 than free pleural air.
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the level of the clavicles, enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach and left PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction
 as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged diffuse interstitial edema.
 2. Previously noted increased lucency at the left costophrenic angle is
 unchanged, in appearance compared to the prior radiograph obtained earlier on
 the same day. Given that there is no apical pneumothorax on this upright view
 - this may represent a summation shadow or a loculated pocket of air rather
 than free pleural air- either airways has remained unchanged hence less
 concerning.
 3. Lines and tubes as above.
