                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with smoking hx, PE and now worse chest
 tightness and crackles  // Evaluate intrapulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, bilateral heterogeneous lung
 opacities are again demonstrated, with mid and lower lung predominance. Some
 of the opacities have reticular and nodular quality an others are more
 confluent, particularly in the right infrahilar area. Many of these findings
 could potentially be due to the patient's history of chronic sarcoid, but a
 superimposed acute process such as infection is difficult to exclude in the
 setting of diffuse lung disease.
