  Changes in the perihilar regions of the lungs bilaterally suggesting
  underlying scarring. Given regions of opacity particularly in the right lower
  lung, superimposed infection or other acute process cannot be excluded without
  prior imaging to evaluate for stability. Followup will be necessary unless
  prior becomes available to document stability particularly for evaluation of
  the increased opacity in the retrosternal clear space.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, SOB, wheezing, ___ sarcoid  // presence of
 infiltrate, pleural effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity seen in the right mid lung and there are changes suggesting
 of underlying fibrotic changes in the perihilar regions bilaterally, right
 greater than left. There is also increased density in the retrosternal clear
 space on lateral view with associated linear, spiculated opacities.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Changes in the perihilar regions of the lungs bilaterally suggesting
 underlying scarring. Given regions of opacity particularly in the right lower
 lung, superimposed infection or other acute process cannot be excluded without
 prior imaging to evaluate for stability. Followup will be necessary unless
