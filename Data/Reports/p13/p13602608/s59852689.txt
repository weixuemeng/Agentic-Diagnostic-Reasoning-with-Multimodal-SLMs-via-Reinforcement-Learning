                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of clotting disorder, recent vascular
 surgery here with concern for wound infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild enlargement
 of the hila bilaterally is compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy, as seen
 on the prior CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Traction
 bronchiectasis and increased interstitial opacities in both lung apices and
 bases do not appear substantially changed in the interval and likely reflect
 chronic findings.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic appearing opacities in both bases along with bilateral hilar
 lymphadenopathy, compatible with history of sarcoidosis.  No new focal
 consolidation identified.
