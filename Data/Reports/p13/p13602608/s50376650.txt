                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with increasing seizure frequency and headache,
 altered mental status, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. CTA torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cholecystectomy clips are noted overlying the right upper quadrant. There has
 been interval removal of a left IJ central venous catheter.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits.  Unchanged
 right hilar fullness may relate to lymphadenopathy.  The left hilum is within
 normal limits.  There is a diffuse pulmonary interstitial abnormality, with
 linear opacities likely reflective of scarring and retraction, most
 conspicuous at the right cardiophrenic angle, unchanged in comparison multiple
 prior examinations, and better evaluated on prior CTA from ___. 
 There is no evidence of superimposed consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse pulmonary interstitial abnormality and right hilar fullness likely
 relates to patient's underlying sarcoidosis, and is unchanged in appearance in
 comparison to multiple prior exams.  No evidence of superimposed acute
 process.
