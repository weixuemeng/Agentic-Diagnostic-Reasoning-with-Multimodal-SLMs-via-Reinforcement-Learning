                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray portable upright
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with elevated WBC, s/p R BKA  // Assess for
 lung pathology that would explain elevated WBC/tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dated ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is an asymmetry in the
 right upper lung that is difficult to characterize without lateral view. 
 There is no evidence of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. 
 Again seen is a PICC line that now terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  The
 hila and pleura are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetry of the right upper lung that may represent a focal consolidation. 
 It is difficult to further evaluate this process on a portable chest
 radiograph.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If the condition of the patient allows, recommend PA and
 lateral chest x-ray for further characterization of right upper lung
 asymmetry.
