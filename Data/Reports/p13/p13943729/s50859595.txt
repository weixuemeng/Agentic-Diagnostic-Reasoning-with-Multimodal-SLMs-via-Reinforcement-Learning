                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pacemaker secondary to complete heart block, major
 pacemaker infection, presenting with sharp chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has been an
 interval increase in the interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally, which
 may be due to moderate interstitial edema or atypical infection.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragm, consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Single-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in
 position.  Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could relate to the prominent
 interstitial markings mentioned above, although underlying consolidation from
 infection and/or aspiration not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffusely increased interstitial markings bilaterally, new since the prior
 study, may be due to pulmonary edema versus atypical infection.  Additional
 left base patchy opacity could relate to the above, although underlying
 consolidation due to infection or aspiration not excluded.
