                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Single-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead extending to the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  The lungs remain hyperinflated, flattening
 of the diaphragms, which may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 There is a slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to
 a trace effusion.  There has been interval decrease in the prominence of
 bilateral interstitial markings since the prior study.  Chronic right upper
 lobe interstitial prominence may be due to scarring.  No focal consolidation. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable with the cardiac silhouette top normal and the aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.
