  1. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis. Alternatively,
  pulmonary embolism could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. If
  further evaluation for potential pulmonary embolism is desired, chest CTA is
  the appropriate study.  If the patient is treated for pneumonia, recommend
  follow-up radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes.
  2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.

  1. Subtle right basilar opacities could correspond to a developing infection
  in the appropriate clinical setting. If the patient is treated for pneumonia,
  recommend follow-up radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes.
  2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with c/o SOB  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs
 ___ outside hospital chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are new, subtle right basilar opacities.  Linear atelectasis in the mid
 left lung is similar.  Subtle l left ower lobe opacities likely corresponding
 to scarring or atelectasis seen on recent outside hospital CT are also
 unchanged.  There is possibly a trace left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Heart size is normal
 and cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.  Alternatively,
 pulmonary embolism could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 If further evaluation for potential pulmonary embolism is desired, chest CTA
 is the appropriate study.  If the patient is treated for pneumonia, recommend
 follow-up radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for changes.
 2. Atelectasis and scarring in the lower left lung are unchanged.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___ ___, M.D. by ___
