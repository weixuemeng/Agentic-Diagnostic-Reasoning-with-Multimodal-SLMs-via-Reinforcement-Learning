                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rightward rotated limiting evaluation. Lung volumes are low. 
 Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique but is likely
 mildly enlarged. There is generalized opacity of the left lung which may be
 positional. More focal opacities at the lung base could reflect atelectasis.
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Opacities at the left base are likely atelectasis although pneumonia or
 atelectasis is possible in the right clinical setting.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
