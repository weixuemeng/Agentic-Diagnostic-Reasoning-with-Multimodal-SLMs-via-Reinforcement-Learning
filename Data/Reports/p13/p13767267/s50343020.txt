                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Pleuritic left chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Although there is no definite
 focal opacity to suggest pneumonia or vascular abnormality to suggest
 pulmonary edema, there are, at both the apices and along each costophrenic
 sulcus, vague increased interstitial opacities.  This indicates the
 possibility for developing interstitial lung disease.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which may suggest developing interstitial lung disease. 
 If further assessment is desired, then dedicated chest CT could be considered
 in followup.
