                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, chest CT
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Again seen is bilateral perihilar and
 paramediastinal opacity, possibly subtly increased since the most recent prior
 study, which may reflect superinfection at the site of known bronchiectasis as
 characterized on the prior chest CT.  Additionally, a new right lower lung
 opacity is also present. Left apical capping is again seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle interval increase in opacity at sites of known
 bronchiectasis may indicate superinfection.
