                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of generalized
 weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Diffuse
 coarsening of the pulmonary markings is increased.  On CT from ___, the patient was noted to havebronchial wall thickening, mucoid impaction
 and areas of bronchiectasis, which appear increased/worsened on the current
 study. Around left base retrocardiac opacity could relate to atelectasis
 although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally, there is a
 rounded opacification projecting over the right lung base at the level of the
 anterior right first rib which could relate to the first rib or could be an
 additional source of underlying consolidation.  There is also increased
 bronchiectatic opacity projecting over the cardiac silhouette on the lateral
 view.    No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is persistent
 left apical thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval worsening of diffuse coarse and fibrotic pulmonary markings which
 could be due to worsening of bronchiectasis and mucus impaction, although
 overlying infection and possible mild volume overload may be present. 
 Additionally, small rounded of focal opacification in the left retrocardiac
 region and in the right lung apex are nonspecific, could be due to
 atelectasis/scarring, although foci of infection is present.
