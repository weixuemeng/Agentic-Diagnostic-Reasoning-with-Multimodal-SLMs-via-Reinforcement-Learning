 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with known bronchiectasis and recent pneumonia. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Partial clearing of left upper, right middle, and right lower lobe
 opacities on a scaffold of chronic bronchiectasis. Again seen is chronic
 interstitial change with traction bronchiectasis, most notable in the left
 upper lobe with elevation of the left pulmonary hilus and tenting of bilateral
 diaphragms.  Heart size is normal and mediastinal and hilar contours are
 obscured by the pleural parenchymal process.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial clearing of the right middle, right lower, and left upper
 lobe opacities at sites of known bronchiectasis.
