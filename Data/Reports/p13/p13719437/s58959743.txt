 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy, worsening oxygen requirements. 
 Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new zone of
 parenchymal opacities at the right lung base.  This zone of opacities could be
 explained by the recent bronchoscopy.  Unchanged are the massive perihilar and
 bilateral as well as left apical parenchymal changes, causing moderate volume
 loss, local fibrosis and pleural thickening at the level of the left apex.  No
 larger pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
