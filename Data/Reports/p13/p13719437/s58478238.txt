 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate normal but increased
 heart size compared to prior.  Stable chronic bronchiectasis with traction on
 the left upper lobe with elevation of the left pulmonary hilus and tenting of
 the bilateral diaphragms.  There is increased opacity at the left lower lobe
 consistent with atelectasis. Increased interstitial markings consistent 
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib
 fracture identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Congestive heart failure on a background of chronic abnormality. Given all the
 abnormalities, acute pneumonia could be easily missed.
