                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening prominence of the left anterior chest wall.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 The osseous structures are unremarkable, though the asymmetry of the chest
 cage which was visible on CT would be difficult to appreciate on chest
 radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  The chest cage asymmetry
 visualized on the prior CT is difficult to reevaluate by chest radiography.
