 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p PICC though pulled back somewhat, please
 assess placement  // Assess PICC placement      Assess PICC placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the left PICC line.  Extends to the
 mid portion of the SVC. There are lower lung volumes.  Suggestion of increased
 opacification at the right base medially. This could merely reflect crowding
 of prominent pulmonary vessels in the region, although in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
