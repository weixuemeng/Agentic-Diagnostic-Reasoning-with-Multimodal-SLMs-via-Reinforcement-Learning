 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-obstructive pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the extent and severity of
 the pre-existing right basal pneumonia is not substantially changed.  The
 lateral radiograph shows that the finding is also associated with a small
 dorsolateral pleural effusion.  Otherwise, the right lung is unchanged. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  Tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  No other parenchymal abnormalities.
