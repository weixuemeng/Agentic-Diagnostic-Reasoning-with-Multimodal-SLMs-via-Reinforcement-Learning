                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT ___.   
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  The heart size is normal.  Again
 seen is an opacity in the right middle lobe obscuring the right heart border,
 which appears less prominent than on the prior chest radiograph.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no other focal consolidation.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle lobe opacity is improved but not completely resolved.  No other
 new findings. Suggest followup with conventional PA and Lateral CXR in 4 to 6
 weeks.
