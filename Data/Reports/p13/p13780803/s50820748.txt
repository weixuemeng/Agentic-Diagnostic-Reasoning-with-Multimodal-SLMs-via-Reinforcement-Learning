                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Flattening of the hemidiaphragms and
 increased AP diameter of the chest suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Opacity in the right middle lobe could be pneumonia, should be
 evaluated with Chest CT to differentiate from mass.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Calcifications are noted within the aortic arch.  The heart size is
 top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Right middle lobe
 pneumonia or mass. Suggest Chest CT.
