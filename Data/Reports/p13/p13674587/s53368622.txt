                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sCHF in respiratory distress on MV  // ETT
 placement, volume overload?      ETT placement, volume overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 943
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 16:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval appearance of bilateral but asymmetric, right greater
 than left, airspace process which may represent asymmetric moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema although diffuse pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage could also
 have this appearance. Clinical correlation is advised. A single lead
 left-sided pacer remains in place. There has been interval intubation with the
 endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. The heart remains enlarged which most likely reflects
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse
 airspace process. There is likely a small left effusion. No large pneumothorax
 is appreciated.
