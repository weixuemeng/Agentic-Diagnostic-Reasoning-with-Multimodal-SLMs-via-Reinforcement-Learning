                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough and ___-pound weight loss over last year.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated. 
 Questionable pulmonary nodule is noted in the left upper lobe although it
 might represent summation of shadows, 9 mm in diameter.  Scarring in the
 apices is noted as well.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Based
 on the patient history, assessment with chest CT would be suggested for
 precise characterization of pulmonary findings.
