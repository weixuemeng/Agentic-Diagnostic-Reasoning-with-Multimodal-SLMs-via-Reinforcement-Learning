 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Asthma and wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of chest were provided.  The lung volumes are
 low, though allowing for this there is no focal consolidation, effusion,
 pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted.  The aorta is
 tortuous, likely accounting for the mildly prominent mediastinal contour.  The
 heart size is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
