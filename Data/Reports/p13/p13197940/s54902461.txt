                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line and Port placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Port can be followed at least as far as the cavoatrial junction although
 more distally the exact termination point is not clear due to
 underpenetration.  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the right
 brachiocephalic vein.  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is a small to moderate pleural
 effusion on the right.  It is difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on
 the left.  Otherwise, aside from suspected coinciding atelectasis at the right
 lung base, the lungs appear clear within limitations of technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.  Port-A-Cath difficult to
 delineate but it can be followed at least as far as the cavoatrial junction. 
 PICC line terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein.
