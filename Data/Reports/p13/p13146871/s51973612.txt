                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of severe central stenosis from T9
 through S1, status post fusion laminectomy.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The patient has been
 extubated with removal of OG tube.  Right IJ sheath terminates in the proximal
 SVC.  Cervical fusion devices and thoracolumbar fusion device is incompletely
 imaged.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Widespread
 bilateral heterogeneous opacities are compatible with mild pulmonary edema. 
 Right upper lobe atelectasis is improved.  Left lung atelectasis is stable. 
 No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval extubation.  Mild pulmonary edema, similar to prior. 
 Improved right upper lobe atelectasis and stable left atelectasis.
