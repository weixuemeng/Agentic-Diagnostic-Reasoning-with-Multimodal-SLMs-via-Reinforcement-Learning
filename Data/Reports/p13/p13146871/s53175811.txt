                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of severe central stenosis status
 post lumbar fusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 5.1 cm above the carina.  OG tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
 Right IJ sheath terminates in the upper SVC or distal right IJ.  Thoracolumbar
 fusion construct is incompletely imaged.  Cervical fusion device and
 constructs is also incompletely imaged.  Ill-defined opacities, most prominent
 over the right upper and left lower lungs are similar to prior, compatible
 with pulmonary edema, although superimposed infection is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 similar to prior.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable exam since study three hours prior, with heterogeneous
 bilateral opacties, which may represent pulmonary edema or infection.
