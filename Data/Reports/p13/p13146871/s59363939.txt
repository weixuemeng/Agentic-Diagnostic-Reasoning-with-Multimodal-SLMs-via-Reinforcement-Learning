                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with severe central stenosis from T9-S1 with
 extensive spondylosis, status post spinal fusion and laminectomy.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal views of the chest were obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 5.4 cm above the carina.  Right IJ sheath terminates in the upper
 SVC or distal IJ.  Cervical fusion construct is similar to prior.  New
 thoracolumbar posterior fusion construct is incompletely imaged.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged with stable widening of the vascular pedicle.  Bilateral
 heterogeneous opacities, most prominent in the right upper and left lower lung
 are compatible with pulmonary edema, although superimposed infection is not
 excluded.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with heterogeneous bilateral opacities,
 compatible with pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infection is not excluded.
