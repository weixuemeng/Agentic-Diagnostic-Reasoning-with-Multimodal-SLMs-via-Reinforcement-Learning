                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Infected wound at laminectomy site with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the left base.  This is consistent with pleural effusion and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 There is some increasing opacification of the pulmonary vessels, raising the
 possibility of some overhydration.
