 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 1:37 PM
  There is a suboptimal inspiratory effort, with low lung volumes.  Allowing for
  changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, with with a
  top normal cardiac silhouette size.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable. 
  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky
  opacity at the right lung base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis in the
  setting of low lung volumes.  Additionally,diffuse, subtle mild interstitial
  prominence likely relates to a combination of age-related changes and crowding
  of bronchovascular structures in the setting of a poor inspiratory effort. 
  There is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
  effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and altered mental status, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a low inspiratory lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this,
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged, with a top normal cardiac
 silhouette size.  The bilateral hila are grossly unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Minimal streaky opacity at the
 right lung base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.  Additionally,diffuse, subtle mild interstitial prominence
 likely relates to a combination of age-related changes and crowding of
 bronchovascular structures in the setting of a limited inspiratory effort.  No
 focal lung consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax detected. Roughly
 circular calcifications of varying sizes overlying the left upper abdomen and
 a left lower lung are of uncertain etiology, but may relate to calcified
 cartilaginous rib ends.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute pulmonary process detected.
