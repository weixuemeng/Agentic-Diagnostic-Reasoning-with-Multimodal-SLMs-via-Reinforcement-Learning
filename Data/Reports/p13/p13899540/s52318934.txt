                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent extubation and hypoxia.  // Please
 assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 decreased. As a result, areas of atelectasis have appeared at both the left
 and the right lung bases. Resolution of these opacities must be
 radiographically monitored, to exclude bilateral basal pneumonia. The right
 Port-A-Cath and the nasogastric tube as well as the left pectoral pacemaker
 are in constant position.  No overt pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
