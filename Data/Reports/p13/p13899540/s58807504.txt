  Extensive heterogeneous bilateral airspace opacities, have slightly decreased
  in density compared to the prior examination. An enteric tube remains in the
  stomach similar to the prior examination. In comparison to the prior study, a
  new tube projects over the cervical spine which appears to make a loop at the
  level of C7 with both ends directed towards the patient's head and excluded
  from the image.  This may represent a malpositioned OG tube and clinical
  correlation is recommended.
