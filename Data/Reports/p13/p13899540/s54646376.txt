                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M intubated, PNA. Evaluate endotracheal tube and central line
 positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  Right chest wall port catheter terminates in the
 right atrium.  Left chest wall pacemaker leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle, appropriately.  Right subclavian central venous catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC. Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities are in
 keeping with multifocal pneumonia, however have acutely worsened since the
 outside hospital chest radiograph. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Appropriate position of support lines and tubes.
 2.  Rapid worsening of pulmonary opacities since the prior outside hospital
 chest radiograph is indicative of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. Preceding
 pneumonia may be present, particularly in the left lower lobe.
