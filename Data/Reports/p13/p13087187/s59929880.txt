                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  This accentuates the size of cardiac silhouette
 which is likely within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
