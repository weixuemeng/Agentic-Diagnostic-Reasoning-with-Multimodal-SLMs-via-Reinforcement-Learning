                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.  The lung volumes are low and mild
 consolidation at the right base may represent atelectasis or developing
 pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Spine fusion
 hardware projects over the lower aspect of the imaged lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basal opacity may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia
 in the appropriate setting.
