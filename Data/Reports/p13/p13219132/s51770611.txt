                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD1, delerious  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  No consolidation or pleural effusion seen.  A linear
 lucency at the periphery of the right lung base is likely due to an
 overlapping skin fold, this would be an unusual appearance for a pneumothorax
 but attention to this area on subsequent chest radiographs is recommended. 
 Right basilar atelectasis.  Previous median sternotomy noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No consolidation seen.  A linear lucency along the right lower chest wall is
 likely an artifact related to an overlying skin fold but a small pneumothorax
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend attention to this area on subsequent chest
 radiographs.
