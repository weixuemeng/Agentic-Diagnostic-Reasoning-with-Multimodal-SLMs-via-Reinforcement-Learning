 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  No appreciable pleural effusions. No
 pneumothorax.  Calcification of the pleural surfaces, predominantly the right
 lung base, reflect prior asbestos exposure.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.
 
 Left-sided AICD with dual leads following their expected courses to the right
 atrium and ventricle.
