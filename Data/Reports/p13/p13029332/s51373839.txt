                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. 
 Hyperinflation of lungs is noted.  Pleural parenchymal scarring within the
 lung apices appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  A focal left diaphragmatic hernia is
 unchanged, better assessed on the prior CT.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
