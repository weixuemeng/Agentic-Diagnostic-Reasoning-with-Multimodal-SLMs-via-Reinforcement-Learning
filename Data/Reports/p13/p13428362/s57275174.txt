                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 reasonably well expanded with elevation left hemidiaphragm resulting in left
 basilar atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion seen.  The heart is moderately enlarged with prominent ascending
 aortic contour. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis likely relating to elevated left
 hemidiaphragm without acute intrathoracic process. If patient is able, a
 conventional 2 view radiograph including a lateral view would be useful to
 assess for left pleural effusion accounting for the basal opacity.
