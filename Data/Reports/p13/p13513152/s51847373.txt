                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left chest pain, assess for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation or signs of pulmonary edema.  Mild blunting at the
 left CP angle likely reflects a small pleural effusion.  Lung volumes are
 somewhat low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Mild hilar
 prominence could reflect bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung
 volumes.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tiny left pleural effusion.
