                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, cough.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ are submitted. 
 There are no comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat diminished lung volumes with prominence of the interstitium which
 could reflect small airways disease or an underlying interstitial abnormality
 including atypical infection and/or other interstitial disease.  No focal
 airspace consolidation is seen to suggest a focal pneumonia.  Enlarged
 pulmonary artery consistent with known pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Although there could be an acute infection, all of these findings could be
 related to the patient's known diagnosis of scleroderma/CREST syndrome.
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  No
 pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Results were
 communicated to Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:25 a.m. by phone who confirms
 that the patient is being treated for an atypical infection at this time.
