                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  CHF versus COPD exacerbation.  ___-year-old woman with lower
 extremity edema, COPD, CHF, now with shortness of breath.  No crackles on
 exam.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show stable cardiac size and no
 central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Slight prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery appears unchanged.  No pleural effusion is present and no
 focal consolidation is seen.  Overall, prominence of interstitium bilaterally
 appears stable and is related to some combination of body habitus and possible
 underlying interstitial fibrosis.  There appears to be a healed fracture of
 the right sixth or seventh rib laterally.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No suspicious interval change and no plain film evidence of acute
 CHF or hyperinflation.
