                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with scleroderma, pulm disease, and increasing leg swelling
 b/l
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Technique is limited due
 to underpenetration and low lung volumes.  The lungs appear clear without
 focal consolidation or overt signs of edema.  Subtle increase in interstitial
 markings may reflect underlying chronic lung disease in this patient with
 scleroderma.  There is prominence of the main pulmonary artery which reflects
 known pulmonary hypertension.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Chronic findings as
 above.
