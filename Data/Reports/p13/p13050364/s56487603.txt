                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and
 obscuration of the costophrenic angle.  This most likely reflects
 postoperative atelectasis and effusion.  However, the descending aorta is not
 as well seen in the retrocardiac region.  This combination of findings could
 reflect lower lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 The remainder of the study is unchanged except for evidence of free
 intraperitoneal gas beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
