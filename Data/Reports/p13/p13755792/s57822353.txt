                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.  Evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Irregular contours of the posterior left
 eighth and ninth ribs are suspicious for possible non-displaced rib fractures.
 A similar abnormal contour in the posterior right seventh rib is also
 suspicious for a possible fracture.  There is a mild compression deformity in
 the lower thoracic spine of indeterminate age.  No other compression fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Possible fractures of the left posterior eight and ninth ribs and right
 posterior seventh rib, but no pneumothorax of pleural effusion.  
 2.  Mild compression deformity in the lower thoracic spine of indeterminate
 age, though likely chronic.  If there is high clinical suspicion for an acute
 compression fracture, could be evaluated with a non-contrast CT.
