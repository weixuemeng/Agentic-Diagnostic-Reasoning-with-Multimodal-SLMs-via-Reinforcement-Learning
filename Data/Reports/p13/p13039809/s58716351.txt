                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are present. Heterogeneous opacities at the right
 lung base are most consistent with an infectious process.  Minimal patchy and
 linear opacity is also noted in the left mid lung field.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.  Given that the right heart border is seen through these
 opacities, the process is likely in the right lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonia at the right lung base, likely in the right lower lobe.
 Mild patchy opacity in the left mid lung field may also represent a second
 area of infection.
