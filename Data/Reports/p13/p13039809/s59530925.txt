                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, history of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left lung is clear.  Subtle right base opacity is most likely
 atelectasis/scarring and in part relate to overlying soft tissue.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lateral right base opacity most likely represent atelectasis in
 combination with overlying soft tissue.  If there is high clinical concern for
 infection, consider PA and lateral views for further and better evaluation.
