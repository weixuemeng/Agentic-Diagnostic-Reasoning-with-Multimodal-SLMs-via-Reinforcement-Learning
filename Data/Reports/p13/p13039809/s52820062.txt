                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:42 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 patchy left mid-to-lower lung opacity not as well appreciated on the prior
 study, worrisome for pneumonia.  There may also be subtle patchy opacity at
 the lateral right base which may be due to atelectasis.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacities in the left mid-to-lower lung and
 possibly the lateral right lung base, not as well appreciated out on the prior
 study, which is less sensitive, concerning for pneumonia.  Recommend followup
 to resolution.
