                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires, prosthetic cardiac valve are noted.  There is a single-lead
 pacer projecting over the left axilla with lead tip extending into the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  Lung volumes are low which somewhat
 limits the evaluation.  There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is noted.  There are
 no definite signs of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly within
 normal limits.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Slight elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.
