 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter again
 extends to the lower SVC.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure persists.
 Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm with retrocardiac opacification is consistent
 with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Less
 prominent effusion and atelectatic changes at the right base.
