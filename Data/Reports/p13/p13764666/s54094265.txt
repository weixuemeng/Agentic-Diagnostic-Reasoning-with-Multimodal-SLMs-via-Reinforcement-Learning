                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AAA repair  // interval change - decreased
 HCT.      interval change - decreased HCT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. 
 The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed, as has the Swan-Ganz
 catheter, which has been replaced with a right IJ sheath.  Bibasilar
 atelectatic changes are again seen, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm
 consistent with substantial volume loss in left lower lobe.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 Little change in the appearance of the mediastinum.  However, if there is
 serious clinical concern for hemorrhage postoperatively, CT would be the next
 imaging procedure.
