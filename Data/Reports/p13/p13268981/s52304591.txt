                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter with residual right internal
 jugular vascular sheath remaining in place.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is accompanied by diffuse interstitial edema, new since
 the recent radiograph.  Additionally, more confluent opacities have developed
 at both lung bases, which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration or developing
 pneumonia.  Moderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm and small left pleural
 effusion are unchanged.
