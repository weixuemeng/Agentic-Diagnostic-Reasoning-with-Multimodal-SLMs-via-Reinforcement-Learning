                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with CHF and shortness of breath for two weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is left basilar opacity
 which may be in part due to elevated left hemidiaphragm, better seen on the
 lateral view.  Instinct pulmonary vascular markings are identified throughout.
 There is a small right and possible trace left effusion.  Linear opacity in
 the right mid lung is potentially subsegmental atelectasis or fluid within the
 fissure.  Basilar opacities may also in part be due to atelectasis noting that
 infection would be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged.  Hypertrophic changes seen in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion and small
 right effusion.  Probable elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar
 opacities potentially atelectasis noting infection is difficult to exclude.
