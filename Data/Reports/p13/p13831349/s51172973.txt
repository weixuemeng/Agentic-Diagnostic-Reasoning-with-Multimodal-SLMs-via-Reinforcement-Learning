                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chronic lung disease, acutely hypoxic assess for cause 
 // assess for infiltrate, pneumthorx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall lung volumes are low.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, and
 bibasilar atelectasis. New bilateral perihilar opacities, left greater than
 right, are most consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is slightly increased from prior.  A left chest wall pacemaker is present,
 with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis, with
 bilateral perihilar opacities are most consistent pulmonary edema, however
 superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
