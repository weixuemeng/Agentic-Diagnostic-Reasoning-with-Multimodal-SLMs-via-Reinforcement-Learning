                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Outside hospital intubation. Evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 courses into the stomach. A right internal jugular catheter traverses into the
 low SVC.  A left pectoral pacemaker is noted with leads in standard position. 
 Orthopedic hardware within the left humerus is partially imaged.
 
 There are bilateral multi focal opacities, compatible with pneumonia. There is
 likely an element of superimposed pulmonary edema given the perihilar
 prominence and small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A
 small amount of fluid tracks into the minor fissure. Mild cardiomegaly. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube 3.1 cm above the carina.
 2. Multifocal pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
