                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and fevers.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the remote examination, there has been interval development
 of bilateral lower lobe, and right middle lobe opacification.  There are
 hyperinflated lungs with irregularity of the peripheral vasculature in keeping
 with emphysema.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  There are multilevel degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine as
 manifested by marginal osteophytic formation, loss of intervertebral disc
 height and endplate sclerosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar and right middle lobe opacification, most compatible
 with multifocal pneumonia though a post-obstructive process is of concern. 
 Recommend followup to resolution or alternatively Chest CT is recommended.
