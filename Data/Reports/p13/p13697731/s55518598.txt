                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for improvement.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the right tracheal wall and should be
 examined to see if it needs more support.  Again seen is a dual channel left
 internal jugular line that ends in the upper SVC.  A feeding tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view.  
 
 There is a more discrete consolidation at the base of the left lung which
 could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  The heterogeneous, infiltrative
 pulmonary abnormality is again seen with an interval increase in the number of
 lucencies, which is concerning for possible barotrauma developing over the
 past few days. Again seen is cardiomegaly, unchanged from the prior study. 
 There are no substantial pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. More discrete consolidation at the base of the left lung which could
 represent atelectasis or pneumonia. 
 
 2. Increased number of lucencies in the heterogeneous widespread pulmonary
 abnormality, possibly related to ventilator associated barotrauma.  
 
 3. Tip of the tracheostomy tube abutting the right tracheal wall.  
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone at 3:57 PM by Dr.
