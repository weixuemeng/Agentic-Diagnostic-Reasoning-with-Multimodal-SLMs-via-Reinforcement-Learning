 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after tracheostomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction
 with chest CTA on ___:
 
 Return of the mediastinum to midline suggests substantial improvement in
 previously collapsed left lower lobe, due to previous retention of secretions.
 There is, however, now mild pulmonary edema and persistent consolidation in
 both lung bases, either of which, particularly the right base on its
 appearance on yesterday's chest CTA, suggest pneumonia.
 
 Heart size is top normal.
 
 Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the right tracheal wall and should be
 evaluated clinically to see if this is acceptable.  Dr. ___ was paged
 at 10:30 a.m.
