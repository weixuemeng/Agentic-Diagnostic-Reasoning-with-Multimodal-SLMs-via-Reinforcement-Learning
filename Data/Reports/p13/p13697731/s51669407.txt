 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with five days of constitutional symptoms,
 acute confusion and seizures in a drug-induced coma.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 4:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely represents lower lobe
 collapse.  There is also some hazy opacity in the right lower lung which
 likely reflects patchy atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusions or pneumothoraces.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
