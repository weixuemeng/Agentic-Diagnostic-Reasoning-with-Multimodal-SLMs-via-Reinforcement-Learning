                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest was obtained with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 All lines and tubes are noted to be in the appropriate position, unchanged as
 compared to the prior examination.  Redemonstrated is evidence of left lower
 lobe volume loss, and a small right pleural effusion with an adjacent right
 lower lobe rounded opacity.  There is no new focal consolidation,
 pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema identified.  Stable, mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly is seen.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
