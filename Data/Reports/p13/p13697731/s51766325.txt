                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed to
 assess the position of NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The right subclavian line and the tracheostomy tip are in appropriate
 position.  The left internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of the
 superior SVC.  No NG tube seen on the first view as well as not on the second,
 that is unclear where located.  Small amount of apical pneumothorax is
 suspected on the left but not clearly seen.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis is
 re-demonstrated.
