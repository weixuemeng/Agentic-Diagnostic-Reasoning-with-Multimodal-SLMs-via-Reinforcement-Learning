 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure, intubation, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement,
 with near-complete resolution of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.  The
 heart continues to be borderline in size and the retrocardiac areas of
 atelectasis persist.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  The monitoring and
 support devices are constant.
