                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again bilateral
 apical scarring and pleural thickening with volume loss in the apices
 bilaterally.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  There is a somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at
 the right base laterally.  This could correlate with an area of opacification
 just behind the major fissure and is suspicious for a right lower lobe
 consolidation.
