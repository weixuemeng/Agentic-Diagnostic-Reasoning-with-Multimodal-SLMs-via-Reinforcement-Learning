 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal contours appear unchanged. 
 Bilateral hilar enlargement with associated streaky perihilar opacities
 extending into the right upper lobe and left lower lobe are compatible with
 known areas of tumor with with endobronchial spread and lymphadenopathy. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No new focal consolidation or
