                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with altered mental status and gait imbalance.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 including borderline cardiomegaly and striking unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.
 A mild mid thoracic vertebral compression deformity appears unchanged. 
 Several levels superiorly, there is new apparent superior endplate sclerosis
 without substantial loss in height, suggesting interval compression fracture,
 which is age-indeterminate.  A more inferior thoracic compression deformity,
 mild-to-moderate, appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Sclerosis along its superior thoracic vertebral body, suggesting
 interval slight compression fracture, although otherwise age-indeterminate. 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
