  Stable or deviation of the trachea is likely due to no large shadowing
  multinodular goiter.  Interval placement of a TEVAR, soft-tissue density along
  the aortic arch and descending aorta outside the stent corresponds with the
  known intramural hematoma.  Stable prominence ascending aorta contributing to
  appearance of a widened, though stable, mediastinum.  No pneumothorax or are
  pleural effusion identified.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-operative evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 aortic stent graft.  A soft tissue density along the aortic arch and the left
 aspect of the descending aorta corresponds to the known intramural hematoma. 
 There is stable minimal widening of the ascending aorta.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  No pneumonia, no pleural effusions.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Minimal contour irregularities along several ribs on the
 right could reflect old healed rib fractures.
