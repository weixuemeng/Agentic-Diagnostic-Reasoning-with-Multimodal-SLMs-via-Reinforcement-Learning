 HISTORY:  Weakness after urinary tract infection 1 week prior.  Evaluate for

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a vague opacity seen within
 the right lower lobe, concerning for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The hilar and
 mediastinal structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Basilar consolidation, most likely right lower lobe, would be
 consistent with pneumonia in the correct clinically setting.  Followup
 radiograph should be obtained after treatment to ensure resolution.
