 When compared to prior, there has been improved aeration particularly at the
 left lung base.  The lungs are grossly clear with some residual retrocardiac
 opacity, potentially atelectasis.  There is no large effusion or pulmonary
 edema.  Chin does obscure visualization of the lung apices.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is again noted.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Right PICC is
 no longer visualized.

 Cardiomegaly.  Improved but some persistent retrocardiac opacity which could
 be atelectasis.  If clinical concern for infection, consider PA and lateral if
 patient is amenable.  No pulmonary edema.
