 mediastinal structures.  A large hiatal hernia occupies the base of the left
 hemithorax with associated left basilar atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  There is no focal consolidation, large pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Degenerative changes are again noted within the right shoulder.
