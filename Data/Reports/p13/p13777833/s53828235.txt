                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness-of-breath and hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal views of the chest.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size
 which remains moderately enlarged.  Large hiatal hernia is air-filled and
 slightly displaces the heart to the right.  Prominence of the mediastinum is
 attributed to patient rotation and stable widening of the vascular pedicle. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is appreciated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
