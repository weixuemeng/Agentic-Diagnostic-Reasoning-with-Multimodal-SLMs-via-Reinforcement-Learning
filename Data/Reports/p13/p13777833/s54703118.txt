                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with small-bowel obstruction, now intubated. 
 Assess for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube and right upper
 central venous line are in unchanged position.  An extremely large hiatal
 hernia continues to cause rightward shift of the mediastinum.  Tip of the
 nasoenteric catheter is above the left hemidiaphragm within the hernia sac. 
 Apparent widening of the mediastinum is similar to prior and likely due to a
 combination of mediastinal shift and patient rotation.  Opacity within the
 right medial lung base has slightly progressed and is likely due to
 progressive middle lobe atelectasis.  Increasing right pleural effusion is
 likely, now moderate.  A small left pleural effusion persists.  Left lower
 lobe atelectasis is also likely.  Upper lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing basilar atelectasis and effusions, now moderate.  No overt
 interstitial edema.
 2.  Mediastinal widening, likely due to rotation and shift, unchanged.
 3.  Unchanged large hiatal hernia
