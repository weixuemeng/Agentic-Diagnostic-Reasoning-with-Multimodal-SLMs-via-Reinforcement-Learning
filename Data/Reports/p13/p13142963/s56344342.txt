                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  There is
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The costophrenic angles are obscured
 suggestive of small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is moderate pulmonary
 edema. No pneumothorax.  Left lung base consolidation is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and moderate
 pulmonary edema.  The left lung base consolidation obscuring left
 hemidiaphragm likely represents a combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis; however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
