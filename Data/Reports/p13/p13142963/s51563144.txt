                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None (patient is listed as EU critical).
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip
 terminates 4.5 cm from the carina.  Right internal jugular central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  A orogastric tube tip
 courses below the diaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of
 the film.  Lung volumes are low.  There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly. 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and supine
 positioning.  There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Consolidative
 opacities in the lung bases are concerning for areas of infection. Patchy
 opacities in the left lung as well as in the right upper lung field may
 reflect areas of infection or aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard position of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.  Right internal
 jugular central venous catheter tip in the proximal right atrium.
 
 2. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 3. Bibasilar consolidative opacities concerning for infection. Additional
 ill-defined opacities within the left lung and right upper lung field may
 reflect additional areas of infection or aspiration.
 
 4. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine positioning and
 low lung volumes.  If there is concern for an acute aortic process, further
 assessment with CT is recommended.
