                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right middle lobe relative linear opacity most likely represents atelectasis
 rather than consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Subcm nodular opacity projecting over the lateral right lower lung may
 represent a granuloma.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Hilar contours are within normal limits.  No displaced fracture
 is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right middle lobe opacity more likely represents atelectasis rather than
 consolidation.  No evidence of focal consolidation seen elsewhere.
