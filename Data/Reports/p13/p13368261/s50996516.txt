                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  White count and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ from ___ and ___; CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. 
 Changes from prior left thoracotomy are similar in appearance to prior
 studies.  Healed right-sided rib deformities are also noted.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may be due to tiny pleural fluid or
 pleural thickening given the prior pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or edema.
