                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is limited due to rotation and low lung volumes.  The heart is
 moderate to severely enlarged.  Widening of the superior mediastinal contour
 is seen similar compared to the prior study and attributable to mediastinal
 fat as seen on the prior chest CTA from ___.  There is crowding
 of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary edema is likely present.
 Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis.  Infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes
 of both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to patient rotation and low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary
 edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection in the lung bases however cannot
 be completely excluded.
