                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP portable view of the chest.  Exam is limited secondary to technique
 and body habitus.   This may account for the increased interstitial markings
 in part.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation or definite effusion
 noting the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, also likely accentuated due to technique and
 unchanged from prior.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion which may be accentuated by
 technique.
