                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Cardiac silhouette remains within upper limits of normal, and there
 is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Some
 hyperexpansion of the lungs again is suggestive of COPD.  No evidence of acute
 pneumonia.
