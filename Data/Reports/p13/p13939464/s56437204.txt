 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 appear hyperinflated.  As also seen on the prior study, there is increase in
 interstitial markings, although less conspicuous as compared to the prior
 study.  Findings may be chronic or due to mild interstitial edema.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation seen.  Cardiac,
 mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable.
