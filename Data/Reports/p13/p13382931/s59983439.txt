                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is slight prominence of the
 interstitium, suggesting minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable with mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal interstitial edema.  Otherwise, aside from this,
 no acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
