                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient six days after aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The current PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates continuous presence of
 pneumoperitoneum although it appears to be decreased since the prior study,
 still visible bilaterally.  Small amount of right pleural effusion is noted,
 associated with minimal basal atelectasis.  Left basal atelectasis is noted,
 smaller and unchanged.  No appreciable pneumothorax is demonstrated.  The left
 PICC line can be seen till the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable in appearance as well as there is an expected location
 and appearance of the replaced aortic valve.
