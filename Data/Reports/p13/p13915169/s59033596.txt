                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after chest tube pulled
 back.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the
 Swan-Ganz catheter and the NG tube.  The temporary pacer is still projecting
 over the chest.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No substantial
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated, although mild interstitial  edema is present.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The left PICC line tip terminates at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis have progressed since the
 prior study, but may be related to interval discontinuation of mechanical
 ventilation.
