                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of coronary
 artery disease after ventricular fibrillation and arrest, treated with
 amiodarone, assessment of the lungs to exclude amiodarone toxicity.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker defibrillator lead terminates in the expected location of right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is
 unremarkable.  The appearance of the mediastinum after CABG is within normal
 limits.
 
 Lungs are well aerated and essentially clear with no evidence of interstitial
 abnormalities that might be consistent with amiodarone lung toxicity.  No
 focal abnormalities are seen as well.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
