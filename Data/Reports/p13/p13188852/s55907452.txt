                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers, chills, on chemotherapy.  Question
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight prominence of interstitial markings diffusely which could be due to
 mild fluid overload or atypical infection.  No lobar consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in interstitial markings bilaterally which may be
 due to mild fluid overload, though atypical infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No lobar consolidation.
