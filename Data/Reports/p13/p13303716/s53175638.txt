                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ACUTE BRONCHITIS
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No comparison.  The lung volumes are normal.  There is a minimal parenchymal
 opacity in the lingula, seen on both the frontal and the lateral view,
 potentially indicative of pneumonia, in the appropriate clinical setting.  A
 metallic particle, obviously outside of the body, is projecting over the left
 cervical soft tissues at the top of the image.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax, no pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the heart.
