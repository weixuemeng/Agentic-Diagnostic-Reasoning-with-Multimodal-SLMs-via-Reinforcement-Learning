                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette remains unchanged. Aorta is diffusely calcified and
 mildly tortuous. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved in the interval. 
 No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
 Atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. Multilevel degenerative changes are
 again seen in the imaged thoracic spine.  Deformity of the left humeral head
 is compatible with a remote fracture.

 Mild pulmonary edema.
