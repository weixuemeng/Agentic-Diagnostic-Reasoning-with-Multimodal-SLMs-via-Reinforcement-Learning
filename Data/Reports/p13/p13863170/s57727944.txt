                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower GI bleed.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is
 upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.  There is minimal atelectasis
 at both lung bases.  There is a small pleural effusion in the costophrenic
 angle posteriorly, possibly present on both sides.  Tiny right pleural
 effusion noted on AP view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions.  No definite
 consolidation, but an early infectious infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
