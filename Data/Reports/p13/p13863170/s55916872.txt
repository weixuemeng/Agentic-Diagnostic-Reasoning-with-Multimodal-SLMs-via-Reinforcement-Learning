                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, fever, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes and slightly rotated positioning.  Possible
 mild cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, which could reflect CHF.  There is some patchy retrocardiac opacity.
 Otherwise, no focal opacity or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Cardiomegaly and CHF.
 2.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity.  The differential diagnosis includes
 atelectasis and consolidation.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may
 help for further assessment.
