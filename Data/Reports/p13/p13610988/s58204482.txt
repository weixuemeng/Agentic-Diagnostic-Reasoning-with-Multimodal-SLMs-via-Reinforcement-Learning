                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with concurrent
 opacities suggesting atelectasis, right worse than left.  There is also
 coarsening of the vascular and interstitial markings more conspicuous in the
 right lower lung field.  There is moderate aortic tortuosity and cardiomegaly.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes of the
 left shoulder are incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarse interstitial markings more prominent in the right lower
 lung field, associated with small bilateral pleural effusions with concurrent
 bibasilar atelectasis, right worse than left; findings suggest mild vascular
 congestion.
