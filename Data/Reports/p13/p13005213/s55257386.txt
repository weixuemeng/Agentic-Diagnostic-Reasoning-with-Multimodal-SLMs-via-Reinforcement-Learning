                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with basal ganglia bleed, htn, afib, intubated. confirm og
 tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP semi erect chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated same date, ___ approximately
 2 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single semi upright AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal
 tube, its tip which terminates approximately 4.9 cm above the level of the
 carina in appropriate position.  An enteric tube descends the thorax in
 uncomplicated course, its tip below the level of the hemidiaphragm projecting
 over the left upper quadrant, new since prior study.  Relative to prior study,
 there is improved aeration of the left hemithorax.  There persists a large
 opacification at the left lung base with mild shift of mediastinal structures
 leftward to suggest a component of volume loss. The right costophrenic angle
 is incompletely imaged.  There is no large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of enteric tube its tip terminating below the level of
 the diaphragm.
 
 2. Improved aeration of the left hemithorax suggesting improved atelectasis
 with persistent significant opacification at the left lung base.  Possible
 etiologies include underlying effusion and atelectasis though infection is
 possible.
