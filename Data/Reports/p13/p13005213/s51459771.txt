 INDICATION:  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  5 AP chest x-rays (4 with # numbers) were obtained portably during
 placement of Dobbhoff tube.  Additional post processed versions were
 generated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 On view # 4, the radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube extends beneath the
 diaphragm and overlies expected location of the stomach.
 
 Allowing for technical differences, findings in the chest including
 cardiomegaly, small bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation are similar the prior study.  Possible minimal upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.
