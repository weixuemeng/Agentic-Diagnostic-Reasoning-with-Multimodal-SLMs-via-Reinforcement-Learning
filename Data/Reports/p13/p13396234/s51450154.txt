                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Aortic stenosis, shortness of breath and dyspnea on
 exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle suggesting trace pleural
 effusions.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  There is diffuse mild increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally, which may relate to chronic lung disease
 with possible minimal interstitial pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The aortic knob is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace bilateral pleural effusions with possible minimal
 interstitial edema.
