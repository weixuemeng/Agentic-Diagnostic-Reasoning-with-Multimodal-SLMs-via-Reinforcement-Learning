 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after perforated duodenal
 ulcer repair.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm.  The right internal jugular line tip
 is in the cavoatrial junction.  There is interval progression, substantial, of
 widespread parenchymal opacities that potentially might reflect a combination
 of pulmonary edema and multifocal infection.  No pneumothorax is seen.
