  Rotated radiograph complicates evaluation. Within this context, there is
  reduced aeration of the left lung that is likely related to a combination of
  left upper lobe mass/consolidation, left lower atectasis, mild edema and an
  elevated left hemidiaphgram. The right subclavian vein port is appropriate.
  Barium is noted in the colon. ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic esophageal cancer, questionable aspiration.   
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:16 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal and
 mediastinal opacities on the left are unchanged.  Also unchanged is the
 elevation of the hemidiaphragm.  Right, peribronchial opacities at the lung
 base persist.  These changes are more likely caused by atelectasis than by an
 infectious process.  However, close radiographic monitoring is recommended.
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
