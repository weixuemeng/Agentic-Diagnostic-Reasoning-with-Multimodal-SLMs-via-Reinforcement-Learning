 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Esophageal cancer, recent pneumonia, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the huge left upper lung
 consolidation, obviously related to a mediastinal or left hilar mass, is
 unchanged in extent and severity.  The presence of additional left upper lobe
 atelectatic component is likely.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Increasing areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has
 been removed.  The right pectoral Port-A-Cath persists.
