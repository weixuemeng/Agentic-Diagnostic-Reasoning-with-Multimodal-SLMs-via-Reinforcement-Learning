 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent aspiration, new saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the evaluation of the lung
 parenchyma is limited by severe respiratory motion artifacts.  However, an
 area of opacity at the right lung base, more likely to represent atelectasis
 than pneumonia, appears to be unchanged.
 
 Also unchanged is the known extensive opacity on the left, with elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.
