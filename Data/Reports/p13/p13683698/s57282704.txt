                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs are available from ___ and a more
 recent CT torso examination is available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is a gastric pull-up,
 which accounts for widening of the right side of the mediastinum.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is a consolidation
 involving the left upper lobe which layers along the major fissure.  In
 addition, there is patchy opacification in the posterior portions of the
 lungs.  To some extent, this probably resides in the right lower lobe,
 although the left lower lobe may also be affected by pneumonia.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs are recommended to show resolution within eight weeks.
