                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female COPD with increased dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Linear
 bibasilar opacities are seen most suggestive of atelectasis or scar.  There is
 blunting of the costophrenic angles potentially due to technique and overlying
 soft tissues although small effusions are also possible.  Superiorly, the
 lungs are clear of consolidation.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. 
 Calcifications along the left aspect of the mediastinum, atherosclerotic in
 nature.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Hyperinflation with linear bibasilar opacities thought to be scarring or
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles potentially technical or due
 to overlying soft tissues noting small effusions are also possible.  If
 desired, a repeat with PA and lateral can be performed.
