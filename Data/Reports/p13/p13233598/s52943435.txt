                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly or CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is prominence of the bilateral hila with increased
 interstitial markings, consistent with mild volume overload.  There are no
 focal airspace opacities to suggest pneumonia.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Mild cardiomegaly.  Recommend a repeat radiograph after diuresis to reevaluate
 the prominent hila.
