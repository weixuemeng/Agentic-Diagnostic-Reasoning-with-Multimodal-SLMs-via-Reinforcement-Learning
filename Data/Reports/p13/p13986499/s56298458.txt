                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs were available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of rib fractures.  Both lungs are clear. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of rib fracture; however, since this technique is not
 dedicated for evaluation of  bones, should the clinical concern for rib
 fracture persists, dedicated rib views are recommended for further evaluation.
