                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RCC, septic shock, AMS  // ? consolidation  
 ? consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through one ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In addition to mild pulmonary edema which is worsened since ___ there
 is greater consolidation at both lung bases.  On the left this could be
 atelectasis alone, but the right lower lobe is concerning for concurrent
 pneumonia.  Interval increase in mediastinal caliber suggests increased
 intravascular volume and/or biventricular cardiac decompensation.  Right
 jugular line ends in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but minimal if any on the right, perhaps small on the left.
