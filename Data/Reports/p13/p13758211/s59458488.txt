                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with myalgias, rigor after flu shot, on chemo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal
 bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated without focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Spinal fixation hardware is again noted
 along with evidence of prior spinal artery embolization.  Degenerative changes
 are seen involving the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints bilaterally. 
 Known left-sided chest wall mass with destruction of the left sixth anterior
 rib is better assessed on the recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
