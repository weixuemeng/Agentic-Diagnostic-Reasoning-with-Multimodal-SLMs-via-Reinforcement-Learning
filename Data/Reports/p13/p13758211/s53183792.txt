                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with central line placement.  Evaluate line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid

 unchanged, with continued minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The known left-sided chest
 wall mass with destruction of the left sixth anterior rib is better assessed
 on the recent chest CT.
 
 Incidental note again made of spinal fixation hardware and evidence of prior
 spinal artery embolization.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  No
 evidence of new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 2.  The known left-sided chest wall mass was better characterized on the
 recent chest CT.
