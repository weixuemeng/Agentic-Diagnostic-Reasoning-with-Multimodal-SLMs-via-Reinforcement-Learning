                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Renal cell carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is bibasilar bronchiectasis and fibrosis, more so on the left
 than the right, which is better characterized on the recent CT, and consistent
 with post-radiation changes.  At least one of the known pulmonary nodules is
 identified on the left measuring 9 mm.  The other small pulmonary nodules are
 difficult to evaluate.  There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Osseous destruction and the soft tissue metastasis in T8 and T9 are unchanged.
 An expansile lucent lesion in the left sixth rib is unchanged.  No new osseous
 lesions are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Known pulmonary metastases are better evaluated on the CT, though at least
 one is identified in the left lung.  If further evaluation for change is
 clinically indicated, a CT is recommended.
 2.  Unchanged bronchiectasis and post radiation changes at the bases.  No new
 opacity to suggest pneumonia.
 3.  Unchanged osseous metastases in T8, T9, and the left sixth rib.
