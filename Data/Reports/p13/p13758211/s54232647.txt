                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary issues prior to new therapy in patient
 with metastatic renal carcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the torso performed on the same date, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an ovoid nodular opacity along the major fissure on the
 left, better evaluated on the CT torso performed on the same date, and
 corresponding to a pulmonary nodule in this location.  A more diffuse opacity
 in the right upper lobe actually corresponds to callus formation around an old
 right first rib fracture as seen on the CT.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left perifissural pulmonary nodule, better evaluated by the CT
 performed two hours earlier.  Otherwise, no acute process.
