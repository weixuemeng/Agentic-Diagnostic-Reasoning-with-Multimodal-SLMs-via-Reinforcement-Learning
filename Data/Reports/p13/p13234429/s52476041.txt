                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p MVR/TVr/ASD repair  // eval ptx     
 eval ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY OF ___, THE MONITORING AND SUPPORT DEVICES
 HAVE BEEN REMOVED WITH A A RIGHT IJ SHEATH IN PLACE.  FOLLOWING CHEST TUBE
 REMOVAL, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX.  SUBSTANTIAL ENLARGEMENT OF THE
 CARDIAC SILHOUETTE PERSISTS WITH VOLUME LOSS IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE. 
 OPACIFICATION AT THE RIGHT BASE COULD WELL REPRESENT VOLUME LOSS IN THE LOWER
 RIGHT LUNG, THOUGH IN THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL SETTING SUPERIMPOSED PNEUMONIA
 WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.
