                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever, please rule out for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single chest AP radiograph demonstrates a calcified, tortuous
 aorta.  Otherwise, the mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours are
 unremarkable.  A very faint opacity in the left lower lung likely represents
 atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting cannot exclude early
 pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint left base opacity represents most likely atelectasis but an
 early pneumonia can not be excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
