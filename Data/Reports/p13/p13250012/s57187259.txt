                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, central venous line placement, please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 right central venous line with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax evident.  Otherwise, exam is unchanged with persistence of the
 left lower lung faint opacity, morel likely atelectasis although developing
 consolidation/pneumonia not excluded.
