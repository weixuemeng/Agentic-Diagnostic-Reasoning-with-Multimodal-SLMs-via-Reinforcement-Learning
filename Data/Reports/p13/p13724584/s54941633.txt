                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with known CHF, with weakness and malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 11:52 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is stable mild cardiomegaly.  The hilar
 and mediastinal contours are stable, with moderate aortic calcification.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is slightly worse since the earlier study done today at 11:52
 a.m.  There is increasing consolidation in the right lung base, consistent
 with pneumonia.  Streaky opacities in the left lung base, likely represent
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  A left chest
 wall AICD device is seen with leads in expected position in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia and mild pulmonary edema.
