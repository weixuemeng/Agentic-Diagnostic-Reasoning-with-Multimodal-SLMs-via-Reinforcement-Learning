                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough for three weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  A few scattered calcified granulomas are
 noted.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is mild left base scarring/atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No significant interval
 change.  Please note that chest CT is more sensitive in detecting small
 pulmonary nodules.
