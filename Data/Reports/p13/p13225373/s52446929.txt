                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and lower extremity
 swelling.  Evaluate for infiltrate or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.  Abdominal radiograph ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lung volumes are low.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal air space consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  A gastric band is noted.  Again seen are distended air-filled
 loops of bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Air-filled loops of bowel appear unchanged from prior.  Again, this may
 represent an ileus, although, a partial obstruction is not excluded.
