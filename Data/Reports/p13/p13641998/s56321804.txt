                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis.  Now with fever and altered mental status, evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The configuration suggests a
 prominence of the left ventricular contour, but there is no significant
 enlargement of the left atrium.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and
 elongated, but without local contour abnormalities or prominent wall
 calcifications.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of
 acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  There is a mild
 blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus extending into the posterior
 pleural sinus.  The left lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are also free. 
 No pneumothorax in the apical area on frontal view.  Moderate degree of
 degenerative changes in the form of bridging osteophytes are seen in the mid
 portion of the thoracic spine, but there is no evidence of vertebral body
 compression.  When comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination, the pulmonary vascular pattern was more prominent.  It coincided
 also with significantly poorer inspiration with high diaphragms as compared to
 the present examination.  This resulted in a crowded appearance of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  The patient also may have been over hydrated at that
 time when examined in the emergency ward.
 
 This congestive pattern has completely normalized on today's examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiac enlargement and moderately widened and elongated
 thoracic aorta, consistent with systemic hypertension.  No evidence of
 pulmonary congestion.  Small right-sided pleural scar formation.  Otherwise,
 findings within normal limits.
