                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and leukocytosis, evaluate for infectious source.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
 or frank pulmonary edema.  Recurrent patchy opacification is seen within the
 right lower lobe, compatible with waxing and waning atelectasis.  Stable
 moderate cardiomegaly is again noted.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There has been interval removal of a right-sided subclavian central venous
 catheter.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of
 view of the radiograph.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Recurrent right lower lobe patchy airspace opacity, suggestive of waxing and
 waning atelectasis.  However, infection is not excluded and, if clinically
 indicated, short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
