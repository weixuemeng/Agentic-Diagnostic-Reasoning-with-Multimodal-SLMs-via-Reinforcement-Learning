 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation.  Apparent interval removal of nasogastric
 tube, although a tube is coiled overlying the lower portion of the neck,
 incompletely imaged on this study.  Clinical correlation suggested to exclude
 coiling of NG tube in the cervical esophagus.  Stable cardiomegaly allowing
 for lower lung volumes.  Resolution of linear right juxtahilar atelectasis but
 development of linear atelectasis at the left lung base.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
