                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable when allowances are made for
 leftward patient rotation.  Overall volume of left lung appears smaller than
 the right but is difficult to assess in the setting of rotation. 
 Heterogeneous opacities in periphery of left mid and lower lung have slightly
 worsened, and there is an adjacent new small left pleural effusion.  Right
 lung is grossly clear.
