                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right are new since
 ___ following tracheal extubation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a
 normal postoperative appearance.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax.
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are
 in standard placements.
 
 Slight interval increase in cardiac caliber could be due to real increase in
 heart size or accumulation of postoperative fluid around the heart.  There is
 no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest that this is hemodynamically
 significant.  No pneumothorax.
