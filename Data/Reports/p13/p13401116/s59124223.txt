                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are multifocal consolidations, somewhat worse on the left
 than the right.  This could be due to multifocal pneumonia or edema.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities, which likely represent multifocal
 pneumonia, although pulmonary edema remains a consideration.
