                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, status post treatment of aspiration
 pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the diffuse parenchymal
 opacities bilaterally have decreased in extent and severity.  They continue,
 however, to be clearly visible.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. 
 Mild elevation of the hemidiaphragms with blunting of the costophrenic
 sinuses, making the presence of small pleural effusions likely.  Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, currently no signs suggesting
 pulmonary edema are present.
