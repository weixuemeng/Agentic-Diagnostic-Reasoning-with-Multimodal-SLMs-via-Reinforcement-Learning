                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT
 torso from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 low which somewhat limits evaluation.  Fluid is noted tracking along the
 fissural surfaces.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is noted.  There is no
 focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable with an unfolded thoracic aorta.  Bony structures are
 stable with multiple lower thoracic and upper lumbar compression fractures
 better assessed on a prior CT torso from ___.  IVC filter is partially
 visualized in the upper abdomen on the lateral view as well as surgical clips
 in the upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema.
