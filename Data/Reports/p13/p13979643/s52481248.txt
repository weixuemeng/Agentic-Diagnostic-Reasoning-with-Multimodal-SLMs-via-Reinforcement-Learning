 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart
 size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, with small amount of fluid seen within the fissures. 
 Additionally, patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 A small left pleural effusion is relatively unchanged compared to prior.  No
 new areas of focal consolidation are present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small left pleural
 effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
