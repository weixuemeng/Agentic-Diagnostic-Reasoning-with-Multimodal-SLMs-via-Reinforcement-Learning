                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Distended abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is
 normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities at the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  Possible trace left pleural effusion is present. 
 No pneumothorax.  No free air under the diaphragms.  There is gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No free air under the diaphragms.  Low lung volumes with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable small left pleural effusion.
