                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with nausea and vomiting.  Assess for infectious
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  A subtle ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung may reflect
 overlapping shadows, though an underlying parenchymal process may be present. 
 Follow-up radiographs are recommended to assess for interval change.  Linear
 scarring within the right mid lung is unchanged from prior.  Linear opacities
 within the bilateral lung bases likely reflect areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is stable mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
 unchanged from prior.  The thoracic aorta is tortuous. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Subtle opacity in the right upper lung,
 possibly representing a confluence of shadows, but follow-up radiographs are
 recommended to assess for interval change.
