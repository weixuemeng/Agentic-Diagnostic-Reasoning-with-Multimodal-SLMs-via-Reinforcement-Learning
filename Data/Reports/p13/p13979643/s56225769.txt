                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 long intestinal tube that appears to extend well into the body of the stomach,
 then curl back on itself into the fundus with the tip pointed distally.
 
 Persistent opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion.  Engorgement of the pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Left central catheter again extends to the lower
 portion of the SVC.
