                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso
 from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is cortical discontinuity along the
 lateral aspect of the left posterior seventh rib, findings compatible with an
 acute fracture.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pleural effusion.
 Projecting over the peripheral right mid-lung is a rounded probable pleural or
 extrapleural opacity, that is new from prior examination.  Recommend follow-up
 shallow oblique radiographs to confirm pleural lesion.  Lungs are clear
 without focal consolidation.  No pulmonary edema is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Left posterior seventh rib fracture.  No pneumothorax. 
 
 2. Right mid-lung pleural or extrapleural opacity of uncertain etiology. 
 Recommend non-emergent shallow-oblique radiographs for initial confirmation.
 If confirmed, CT would be suggested for further characterization. 
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the above results (#1) to Dr. ___ at
 ~2 am on ___ by telephone, 5 minutes after discovery.  Follow-up
 recommendations were communicated to the ED QA nurses, who will get in touch
 with the patient.
