                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and elevated WNC
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral
 views are suboptimal due to the patient's overlying arm.  Given this, no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Surgical hardware is
 partially visualized in the cervical spine as well as overlying ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal lateral view due to the patient's overlying arms. 
 Given this, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
