                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with respiratory distress.  Evaluation for
 pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates a dual-lead
 pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle and a
 left-sided port with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction, both
 inferiorly displaced by a left neck mass, possibly a goiter.  The lung volumes
 are low, and there is perihilar haziness and thickening along the minor
 fissure, consistent with pulmonary edema due to heart failure.  An underlying
 infectious process cannot be completely excluded, particularly given the
 appearance of a ringed opacity in the right lower lobe, which could represent
 a cavitary lesion.  The heart is enlarged.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and heart failure.
 2. Underlying infection cannot be excluded, with possible cavitary lesion in
 the right lower lung.
 3. Left-sided neck mass, possibly a goiter.  
 4. Given these findings, a non-contrast CT scan of the chest is recommend for
 further characterization.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone a
 08:00, ___ min after discovery.
