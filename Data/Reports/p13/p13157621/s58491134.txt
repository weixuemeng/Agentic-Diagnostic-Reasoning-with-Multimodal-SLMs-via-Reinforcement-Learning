                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy
 lingular opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although an early
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle lingular patchy opacity may be due to atelectasis,
 although an early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
