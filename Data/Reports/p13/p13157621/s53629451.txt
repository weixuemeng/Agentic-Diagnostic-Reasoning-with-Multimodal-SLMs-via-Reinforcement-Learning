                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a semi
 erect position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are noted to be decreased.  Allowing for differences in
 technique, the previously described subtle opacity in the left lower lobe is
 no longer identified.  The remainder of the lungs are essentially clear
 without pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema.  The heart
 size is normal.  The aorta is noted to be tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval resolution of the patient's previous left lower lobe opacity.
