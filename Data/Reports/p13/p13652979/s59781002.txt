                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman, husband just died of miliary tuberculosis.
 Close exposure.  // PLEASE EVALUATE FOR T.B.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are well-expanded and grossly
 clear.  No definite pleural effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of active pulmonary infection. However, miliary
 nodules from pulmonary tuberculosis may be radiographically occult.  If
 clinical suspicion for miliary infection is high, a chest CT could be
 considered if warranted clinically.
