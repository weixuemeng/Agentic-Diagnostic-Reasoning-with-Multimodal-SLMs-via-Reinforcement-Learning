                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CHF, CAD and MI with chest pain, shortness of breath and
 orthopnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis
 and small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly improved since the prior
 study.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with COPD.  No pneumothorax is
 present. Subtle lateral right base opacity may be due to atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions again
 seen, are improved since the prior study.
