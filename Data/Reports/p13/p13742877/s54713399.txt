                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset palpitations, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is tiny nodular vague opacity in the right lung base
 which could represent a very early pneumonia.  In addition, there is left
 basilar linear density which is stable and likely represents scarring.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no sign of CHF.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with atherosclerotic calcification
 along the aortic knob.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle nodular opacity in the right lung base is concerning for
 an early pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Hyperinflated lungs
 likely reflect COPD.
