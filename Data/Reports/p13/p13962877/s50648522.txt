                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ORIF left proximal femur.  Presents for additional
 procedure.  Assess for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-erect single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable
 moderate cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. Hila
 appear somewhat enlarged possibly due to vessel engorgment, but perception of
 asymmetric increase of the right hilus is largely due to patient rotation. 
 There is a significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged
 compared to ___ with associated atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis is
 also noted on the left.  There is diffuse slightly prominent interstitium
 which is likely due to chronic lung changes.  No pneumothorax identified. 
 Likely small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Small left pleural effusion.
 Background prominence of interstitium is likely due to chronic interstitial
 lung changes. Stable right hemidiaphragm elevation.
