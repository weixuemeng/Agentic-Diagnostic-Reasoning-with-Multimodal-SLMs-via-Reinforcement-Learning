                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CTA of the chest from ___, prior CT
 chest from ___ and prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The background density of the lung
 parenchyma is increased compared to prior particularly in the left hilar and
 suprahilar region.  This corresponds with bronchiolar nodularity evident on
 the concurrent chest CT, raising the concern for a viral or atypical infection
 such as ___.  There is no confluent consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is
 no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Left hilar and suprahilar density better characterized on concurrent chest CT,
 concerning for a viral or atypical infection (___).
