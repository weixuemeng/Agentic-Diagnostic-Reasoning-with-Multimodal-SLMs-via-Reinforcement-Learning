                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with respiratory distress
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular
 structures and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy right basilar opacity likely reflects
 an area of atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Please note that the extreme lung apices are somewhat obscured
 by the patient's neck and chin obscuring this region.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable right basilar atelectasis and possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
