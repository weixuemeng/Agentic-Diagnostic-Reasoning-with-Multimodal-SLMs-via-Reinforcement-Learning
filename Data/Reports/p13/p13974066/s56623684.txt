                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The frontal radiograph is in a lordotic position, somewhat limiting
 evaluation.  However, the lungs appear normally expanded and clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Slight deviation of the trachea may reflect
 goiter. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality detected. Possible thyroid
 goiter could be correlated with physical exam.
