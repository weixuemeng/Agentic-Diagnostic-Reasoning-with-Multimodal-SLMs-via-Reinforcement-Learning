  Status post extubation.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are
  re-demonstrated.  New bilateral mid to lower lung heterogeneous opacities are
  concerning for a developing infectious process, although aspiration
  pneumonitis could have a similar appearance.  Alternatively, mild interstitial
  pulmonary edema could potentially explain these findings.  Findings were
  discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:11 a.m. via telephone on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Leiomyosarcoma, status post resection, cough and increasing
 oxygen requirements.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  At the lung bases, there is blunting of the costophrenic sinuses
 and opacity in the retrocardiac area.  These changes overlay the known
 metastatic disease.  The changes could represent pneumonia.  
 
 In the interval, the patient has been extubated.  The lung volumes remain low
 and the size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.  Signs
 of pulmonary edema are not present.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 9:47 a.m., on ___, the
 findings were discussed over the telephone with the referring physician ___.
