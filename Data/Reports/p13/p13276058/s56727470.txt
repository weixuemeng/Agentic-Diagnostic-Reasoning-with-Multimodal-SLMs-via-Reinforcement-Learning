 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Widespread pulmonary nodules and masses are again demonstrated and

 consolidation and/or atelectasis at the lung bases on the previous study have
 resolved, and previously present pleural effusions are no longer evident. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
