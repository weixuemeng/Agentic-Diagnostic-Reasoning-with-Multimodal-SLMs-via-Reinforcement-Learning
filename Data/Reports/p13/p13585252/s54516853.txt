 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of sub to eat 2, allowing for changes in degree
 of inspiration, there is probably little change.  Again there is extensive
 consolidation in volume loss in the left mid and lower lung zones, which is
 consistent with the diagnosis of severe radiation pneumonia.  Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle with elevation of the hemidiaphragmatic contour is
 again seen.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or cardiomegaly.
