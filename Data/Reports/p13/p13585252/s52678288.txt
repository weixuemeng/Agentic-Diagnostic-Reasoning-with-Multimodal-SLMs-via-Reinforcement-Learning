                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT pulled out then replaced  // evaluate
 for NGT positioning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, a feeding tube has
 been replaced, now terminating in the body of the stomach.  There is otherwise
 little change in the appearance of the chest except for slight worsening of
 bibasilar opacities.  Known left lower lobe mass and associated
 lymphadenopathy have  been more fully evaluated by cross-sectional imaging
 studies.
