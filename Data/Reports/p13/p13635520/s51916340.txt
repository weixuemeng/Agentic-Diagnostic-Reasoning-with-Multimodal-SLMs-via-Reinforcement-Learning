                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with left elbow pain and shooting pain and intermittent grip
 strength loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lung volumes are low which
 limits the evaluation.  Allowing for this, the lungs are clear without
 convincing evidence of pneumonia or edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Low lung volumes limits assessment.
