 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___, and CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with rightward
 shift of the mediastinal structures, consistent with large pleural effusion
 and collapse.  A small portion of the left upper lung appears minimally
 aerated.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears chronic, but
 may reflect a small amount of pleural effusion.  Assessment of the cardiac
 silhouette is limited.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete opacification of left hemithorax due to large pleural effusion
 and collapse.
