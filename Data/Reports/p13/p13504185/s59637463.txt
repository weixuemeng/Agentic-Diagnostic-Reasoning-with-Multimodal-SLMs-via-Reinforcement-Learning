                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent pleural effusion now s/p VATS on
 ___  // interval change in effusion with lateral CT (please perform at 7AM) 
 interval change in effusion with lateral CT (please perform at 7AM)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Left chest tube remains in place without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Opacification along the left lateral chest wall is consistent with pleural
 fluid.  The opacification in the left mid and lower zone most likely reflects
 re-expansion edema combined with residual pleural fluid and atelectatic
 changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to
 exclude superimposed pneumonia.
 Cardiac silhouette again is prominent and there is mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure and atelectatic changes at the right base.
 The left subclavian catheter is no longer seen.
