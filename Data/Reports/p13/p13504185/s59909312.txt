                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p L VATS decortication now with apical chest
 tube removed.  // Assess for interval PTX.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of 1 of the left-sided chest drains without
 evidence of of a pneumothorax.  A small amount of pleural fluid tracks along
 the left chest wall.  Airspace opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects
 re-expansion pulmonary edema and is unchanged compared to the prior study. 
 Infection cannot be definitively excluded.  Linear atelectasis of the right
 lung base.  Persistent left basilar atelectasis.  A left subclavian catheter
 terminates at the proximal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
