 effusion appears mildly improved. An opacity along the left lateral chest
 wall, likely represents surgical changes following pleurodesis and is
 significantly improved.
 
 Predominately bibasilar alveolar and interstitial opacities in the setting of
 moderate cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely
 represents improved mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Moderate retrocardiac
 atelectasis is unchanged.
