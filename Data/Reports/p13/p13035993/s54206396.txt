                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of diastolic heart
 failure.  Questionable pulmonary edema, assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation, but no typical configuration abnormality can be identified. 
 Thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but no local contour
 abnormalities or advanced wall calcifications are seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is characterized by relatively prominent central vessel and some
 irregularity in the peripheral vascular distribution, all compatible with some
 evidence of COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be
 identified.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any
 significant fluid accumulation.  No evidence exists in the apical area on the
 frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits.
 Comparison is extended to seven preceding PA and lateral chest examinations
 beginning ___ to now.  At no point was there any significant
 interval change in the appearance of the findings.  On all studies, the heart
 size was observed to be at the upper limit of normal variation.  According to
 history, the patient had undergone right coronary artery single vessel
 angioplasty intervention at another institution.  An additional finding made
 on the chest x-ray is that the patient is very adipose with large soft tissue
 structures surrounding the thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No signs of acute pulmonary infection or
 acute CHF with pulmonary congestion.
