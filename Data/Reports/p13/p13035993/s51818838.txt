                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  Mildly increased focal opacity in the central right lower lung
 without correlate on the lateral view likely represents atelectasis, but an
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly increased focal opacity in the central right lower lung likely
 represents atelectasis, but early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
