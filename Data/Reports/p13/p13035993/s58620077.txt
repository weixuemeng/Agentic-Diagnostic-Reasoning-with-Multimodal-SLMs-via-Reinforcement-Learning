                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with weakness and fever.  Evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison with prior studies is complicated due to magnifying
 effect of AP view on the heart.  Allowing for those limitations, there lung
 volumes are low, but there is no definite focal opacity. The left lower lung
 field cannot be assessed in the frontal view due to obliteration by magnified
 heart shadow, but the lateral view does not demonstrate focal opacities or
 pleual effusion at this level.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute intrathoracic process.  Unchanged
 compared with ___ allowing for difference in techniques.
