                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Little change in the bilateral basilar
 opacifications, more prominent on the right.  Although these could reflect
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions, in view of the clinical history, the
 possibility of aspiration or developing infection would be difficult to
 exclude.
