                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggests underlying chronic pulmonary
 disease.  However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.
