                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:09 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with glioblastoma and generalized tonic-clonic
 seizures.  Intubated for apnea and airway protection.  Assess tubes and lines.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___,
 
 ET tube in standard position.  Right subclavian infusion port ends low in the
 SVC, and upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a
 non-distended stomach.  Opacification at the left lung base is usually due to
 atelectasis, followup advised.  Upper lungs are entirely clear.  Heart size is
 top normal.  Supine positioning probably explains the slightly increased
 caliber of the azygos vein.  No pneumothorax.
