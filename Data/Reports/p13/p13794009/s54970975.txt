                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:26 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recently placed nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the mid portion of a non-distended
 stomach.  Lung volumes are lower, accounting in part for greater caliber of
 the pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature and heart size which is probably top
 normal.  Greater opacification in the left lower lobe obscures the margin of
 the descending aorta and left hemidiaphragm could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
 Pleural effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Right central venous
 infusion catheter ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
