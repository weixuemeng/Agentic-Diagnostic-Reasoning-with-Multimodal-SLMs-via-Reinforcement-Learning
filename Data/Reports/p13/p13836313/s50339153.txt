                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISONS: ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new single-lead pacemaker device which has been placed
 since the earlier examination, with its lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  A punctate hyperdense focus in the anterior mediastinum to the
 right of midline appears unchanged.  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A mild diffuse interstitial
 abnormality is quite similar to the prior examination.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Bony demineralization
 and mild degenerative changes along the thoracolumbar spine, including
 prominent anterior osteophytes along a few lower thoracic interspaces, appear
 unchanged.  The patient is status post incompletely imaged left shoulder
 replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest including a widespread
 mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality.  Differential considerations
 include chronic pulmonary vascular congestion or an intrinsic interstitial
 abnormality.
