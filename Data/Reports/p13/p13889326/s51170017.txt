                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patient rotation slightly limits evaluation. 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Right-sided PICC tip
 terminates in the SVC.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.   The
 aorta remains tortuous.  There is mild perihilar haziness with vascular
 indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary congestion.  Hazy opacification
 within the lung bases indicates the presence of small layering pleural
 effusions, which are likely similar when compared to the prior study allowing
 for differences in patient positioning.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis and are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with continued bibasilar airspace
 opacities, likely atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
