                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with low oxygen saturation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The patient is rotated to the right
 on this examination.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact from prior CABG. 
 Numerous mediastinal clips are again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
 The lungs are clear.  No confluent opacity is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are evident.  Surgical
 clips are again noted below the right hemidiaphragm and likely related to
 history of cholecystectomy as evidenced by prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
