                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple falls,reported hypotension, confusion, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.  Cardiac silhouette
 is obscured due to a large hiatal hernia.  Allowing for this, heart size is
 probably borderline enlarged.  There is borderline upper zone redistribution,
 without other evidence of CHF.  The right lung is grossly clear without
 effusion.  Allowing for areas obscured by the hiatal hernia, the left lung
 also appears grossly clear without effusion.  Mildly dilated loop of small
 bowel is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large hiatal hernia, slightly larger than on ___.
 2.  Background COPD.  No focal infiltrate, effusion, or CHF.
 3.  Mildly dilated loop of small bowel beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
