                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD with recent treated flare, now with persistent
 dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded, in keeping with COPD.  Evaluation of
 the cardiac silhouette and left lung base is limited due to the presence of a
 large hiatal hernia, unchanged from prior studies, with adjacent atelectasis. 
 Allowing for this, the heart size likely remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  No significant pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  A subtle opacity projects just superior to the
 right clavicle and seen on the prior study of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No evidence of fluid
 overload.
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.  
 3.  Subtle opacity projecting superior to the right clavicle.  Recommend an AP
 lordotic view as initial followup and, if the finding persists, CT could be
 considered for further evaluation at that time.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Finding #3 and recommendation was communicated by Dr. ___ to
 Dr. ___ ___ medicine via telephone at 8:55pm on ___.
