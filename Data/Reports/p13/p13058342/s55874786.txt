  1.  Abnormal soft tissue in the upper mediastinum, left greater than right,
  may be due to underlying mass.  This will be further evaluated on the CT
  chest.
  
  2.  Right basilar and right upper lung consolidations are also present.
  
  3.  Endotracheal tube terminates 7.9 cm above the carina and should be
  advanced.
  
  4.  Enteric tube projects over the upper thorax, and should also be advanced.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is abnormal soft tissue in the upper mediastinum, left greater than
 right, which may be due to underlying mass or aortic abnormality. Right
 basilar and right upper lung consolidations are also noted.  The endotracheal
 tube terminates 7.9 cm above the carina and should be advanced approximately
 4-5 cm for optimal placement.  An enteric tube projects over the upper thorax,
 with its side hole at the level of the posterior third rib. The heart size is
 normal.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Abnormal soft tissue in the upper mediastinum, left greater than right,
 may be due to underlying mass or aortic abnormality.  This will be further
 evaluated on the CT chest.
 
 2.  Right basilar and right upper lung consolidations are also present.
 
 3.  Endotracheal tube terminates 7.9 cm above the carina and should be
 advanced.
 
 4.  Enteric tube projects over the upper thorax, and should also be advanced.
