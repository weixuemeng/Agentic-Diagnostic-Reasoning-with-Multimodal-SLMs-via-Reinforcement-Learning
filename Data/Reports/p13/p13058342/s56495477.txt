  1.  Large, elongated left upper lung opacity may be due to an underlying mass
  or aortic abnormality.  CT chest is recommended for further evaluation.
  
  2.  New right IJ central line tip terminates at the distal SVC.
  
  3.  Endotracheal tube is present approximately 8.6 cm above the carina and
  should be advanced approximately 5 cm.
  
  4.  Enteric tube projects over the upper thorax, and should be advanced to
  ensure placement within the stomach.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CVL in R IJ.  Evaluate line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new right internal jugular central venous line tip projets over the lower
 SVC.  The endotracheal tube tip is positioned a 8.6 cm above the carina and
 should be advanced approximately 5 cm.  The enteric tube tip projects over the
 upper thorax.  Right basilar and right upper lung consolidations are again
 seen. Large circumscribed the elongated opacification overlying the left upper
 lung may be due to an underlying mass or aortic abnormality.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Abnormal soft tissue in the upper mediastinum, left greater than right, is
 again seen.  This may be due to underlying mass.  CT chest has been ordered
 for further evaluation.
 
 2.  New right IJ central line tip terminates at the distal SVC.
 
 3.  Endotracheal tube is present approximately 8.6 cm above the carina and
 should be advanced approximately 5 cm.
 
 4.  Enteric tube projects over the upper thorax, and should be advanced to
 ensure placement within the stomach.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest recommended for further evaluation of left upper
 lung opacity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings and recommendation for a CT chest were
 communicated in person by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ on ___,
 immediately after discovery.
