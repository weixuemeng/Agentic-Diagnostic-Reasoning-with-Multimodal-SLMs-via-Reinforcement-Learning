 PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT from ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The large hiatal hernia seen on previous exam is not clearly delineated on the
 current exam.  There is dense left basilar opacity silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm, likely in part due to pleural effusion with underlying
 consolidation and/or atelectasis suspected.  Small right pleural effusion is
 also noted.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  Prosthetic aortic valve is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right effusion.  Left basilar opacity likely due to combination of
 effusion atelectasis and possible consolidation.
