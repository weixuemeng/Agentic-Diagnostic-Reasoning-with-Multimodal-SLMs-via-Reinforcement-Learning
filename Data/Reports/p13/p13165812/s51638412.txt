                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w COPD (refuses oxygen at home), CAD, HTN, HLD who presents
 from her assisted living with CHF exacerbation, found to have PNA on chest CT
 now with increased work of breathing // ?effusion, worsening PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis are
 not significantly changed since recent CT although there is some
 redistribution. Reticulated opacity in the right mid and upper lung is
 slightly worse. The left upper lobe is relatively clear. The heart is
 partially obscured by pleural effusions and not well evaluated. The aortic
 knob is calcified. Pleural thickening at the right apex is re- demonstrated.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly
 changed since recent CT
 2. Reticulated opacity in the mid and upper right lung is worse concerning for
 persistent pneumonia
