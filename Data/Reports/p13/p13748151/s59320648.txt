                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:42 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to more ___:
 
 Severe opacification in the left hemithorax is new.  The abnormality obscures
 much of the left lower lung.  I cannot tell whether it is pulmonary alone or
 combination of pulmonary and pleural abnormality.  This could be a large
 pneumonia or a left lower lobe collapse as well as substantial left pleural
 effusion, most likely hemothorax in this patient.  I discussed these findings
 by telephone with Dr. ___ ___ ___ clinical profile suggests acute lobar
 collapse.  Imaging confirmation can be provided by chest CT scanning if
 appropriate.
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion suggests elevated left atrial pressure. 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and two cardiac valve replacements.  There
 is no pulmonary edema.
