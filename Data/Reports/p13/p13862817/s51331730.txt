                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AAA repair, open abdomen, question fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 An ET tube is present - the tip lies approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube is also present.  Due to underpenetration, it is difficult to trace
 the NG tube beyond the level of the mid/lower esophagus.  The significance of
 this on this film, due to underpenetration, is uncertain.  
 
 Rotated positioning. Of note, there is marked asymmetry and vascular markings
 between the two lungs, with a marked paucity of vascular markings in the right
 lung and some clustered vascular markings and/or atelectasis at the right lung
 base.  There is also attenuation of mid and upper zone vessels  and clustered
 vessels at the base on the left side, but the gradation is less pronounced. No
 vascular upper zone redistribution or pleural effusion is identified.
 
 The mediastinum is midline.  The cardiac silhouette is not well delineated,
 but is likely slightly enlarged, with unfolded aorta.  The possibility of
 prominent hila related to pulmonary hypertension cannot be excluded. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Difficult to follow NG tube beyond lower esophagus, ?technical.  If
 clinically indicated, a repeat film with better positioning and increased
 penetration could help to assess this.
 
 2) Marked attenuation of upper and midzone vascular markings, assymetricall y
 muuch more pronounced in the right lung.   This is of uncertain etiology, but
 most likely reflects advanced bullous changes due to background COPD.   If the
 patient has a baseline  chest x-ray(none on PACs record), this could help for
 further assessment.
 
 3.  Doubt CHF.
