                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ON ___ AT 10:30 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  AAA repair, dropping hematocrit and decreased breath sounds.  Assess
 possible hemothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The patient has very severe emphysema, with totally absent vasculature in the
 mid and upper right lung.  Previous mild edema in the left lung has improved,
 and left lower lobe atelectasis has also decreased.  There is some residual
 consolidation at both lung bases, right greater than left, which could be
 atelectasis or infection.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements
 respectively, and an upper internal drainage tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.  Because this patient's emphysema is so severe, it may be
 important to document the extent of atelectasis and pleural effusion, both of
 which can be treated.  No subsequent chest radiographs ordered at the time of
 this review, 12:30 p.m. on ___.
 
 Volume of pleural fluid is no more than 600 cc on either side of the chest. 
 It developed between 2:40 a.m. and 5 p.m. on ___ and is little changed
 since.
