 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with 5mm parafalcine SDH and T11-T12
 hyperextension injury, c/o back pain now with new cough and sob  // new cough,
 ronchi     new cough, ronchi
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung
 volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
 The multiple pulmonary nodules throughout the lungs were much better
 identified on the CT scan of ___.  Given the pulmonary changes and
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette, it would be extremely difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
