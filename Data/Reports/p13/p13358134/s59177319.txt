                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with likely new
 atrial fibrillation and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The lung volumes are
 low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mild to
 moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. 
 Innumerable nodules are demonstrated throughout the lungs bilaterally
 compatible with known carcinoid metastases, better assessed on the recent
 chest CT.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular markings but this is felt to be due to low
 lung volumes. No definite pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules compatible with known carcinoid
 metastases.  Low lung volumes without definite evidence for pulmonary edema.
