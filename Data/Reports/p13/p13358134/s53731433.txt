                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Lung volumes are low
 which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which remains mildly
 enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary
 edema. Innumerable basilar predominant nodular opacities are less pronounced
 on the current study but compatible with known metastases. Patchy opacities
 are re- demonstrated in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No
 new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Multilevel degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable pulmonary metastases are less pronounced on the current study.
 Bibasilar atelectasis.
