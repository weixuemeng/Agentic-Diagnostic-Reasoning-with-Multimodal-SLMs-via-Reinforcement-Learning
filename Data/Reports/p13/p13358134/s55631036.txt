                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dizziness, needs infectious workup
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged. Low lung volumes are present with crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Innumerable pulmonary metastases
 are re- demonstrated diffusely. Chain sutures are noted in the left lower lobe
 with adjacent scarring.  Patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded. No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are again seen noted within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with innumerable pulmonary metastases.  Left basilar opacity,
 likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
