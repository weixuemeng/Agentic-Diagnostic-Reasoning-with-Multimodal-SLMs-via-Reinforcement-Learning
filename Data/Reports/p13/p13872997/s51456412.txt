                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, assess for the endotracheal tube. 
 Patient has history of alcoholic cirrhosis, upper GI bleed.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 6.3 cm from the carina, just
 above the level of medial heads of the clavicles.  Consider advancing the ET
 tube by another 2.5 cm for a better seating.  Bilateral lungs are remarkable
 for mild pulmonary vascular congestion, prominent bilateral hila and azygos
 vein which is likely from volume overload, given clinical setting.  Heart size
 is top normal.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
