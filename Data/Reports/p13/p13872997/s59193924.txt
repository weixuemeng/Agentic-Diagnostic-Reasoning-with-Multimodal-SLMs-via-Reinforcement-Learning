 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain, ascites  // assess for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged, not substantially changed in the interval.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.  There may be mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, as seen previously, without frank pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases are compatible with areas of
 atelectasis.  A TIPS catheter projects over the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, as seen previously, with
 bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation.
