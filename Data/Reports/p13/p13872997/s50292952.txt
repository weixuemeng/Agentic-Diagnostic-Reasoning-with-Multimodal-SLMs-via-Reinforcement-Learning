                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with ascites, weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mediastinal contours are stable, within normal limits.  Heart size is
 top-normal.  The bilateral hila are unremarkable.  Subtle opacity at the right
 cardiophrenic angle likely reflects crowding of normal bronchovascular
 structures, although may be slightly more prominent in comparison to
 radiograph from ___.  The lungs are otherwise clear without focal
 consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Again noted is a TIPS stent overlying
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right cardiophrenic angle opacity is slightly more prominent in comparison to
 ___.  Although possibly reflective of crowding of normal
 bronchovascular structures, recommend short interval follow-up PA and lateral
 chest x-ray to exclude a developing infection.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short interval (approximate 8-hr) repeat chest x-ray.
