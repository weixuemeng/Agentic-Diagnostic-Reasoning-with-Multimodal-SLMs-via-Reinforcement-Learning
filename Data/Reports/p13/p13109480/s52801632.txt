                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. There is mild calcification of
 the aortic knob. There is flattening of the diaphragms and there is increased
 lucency of the upper lobes compatible with COPD.  Note is made of calcified
 pleural plaques, suggestive of prior exposure to asbestos.  Vague opacities in
 the lower lungs could represent en face calcified pleural plaque as is seen in
 the lateral projection however, an underlying infection cannot be excluded.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Vague opacities in the lower lungs could represent en face
 calcified pleural plaque as is seen in the lateral projection however, an
 subtle infection cannot be excluded.
