                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with new peritoneal dialysis, DOE  // Eval for
 volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. Subtle increase in interstitial
 markings bilaterally, right slightly greater than left, may be due to mild
 interstitial edema. .  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiac silhouette is moderate to severely enlarged. Aortic knob calcification
 is seen. Mild prominence of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, right greater than left,
 raises concern for mild interstitial edema. Mild prominence and indistinctness
 of the central pulmonary vasculature suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
