                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confusion.  Elevated lactate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation on the lateral radiograph is limited by positioning. 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low, causing some bronchovascular crowding.  No
 significant pleural effusion is seen.  Patchy opacity in the posterior lower
 lobe lobe likely represents atelectasis.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy left basilar opacity, probably due to atelectasis.
