                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough diagnosed with pneumonia at outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is an
 opacity projecting along the right heart border which may be due to a right
 middle lobe and infection however, there appears to be mild pectus deformity
 at this location on the lateral view, it is unclear whether it relate to this.
 Comparison with prior chest radiographs would be helpful for further
 evaluation.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relative opacity projecting along the right heart border could be
 due to a right middle lobe consolidation, however, there appears to be pectus
 deformity at this location on the lateral view and findings may be
 artifactual.  Comparison with prior studies would be helpful for further
 clarification.
