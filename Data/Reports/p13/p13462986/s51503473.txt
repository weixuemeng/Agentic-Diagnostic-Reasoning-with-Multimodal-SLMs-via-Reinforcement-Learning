                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  Question fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with mild unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  Within the limitations of technique, the mediastinal
 contours appear mildly widened along the right upper portion, although likely
 within normal limits.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild peripheral reticulation suggests some background interstitial changes.  A
 thin anterior flowing syndesmophyte courses throughout the visualized thoracic
 spine suggesting hyperostosis.  The bones are probably demineralized.  
  
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No definite evidence of injury.  
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild interstitial changes in the lungs.
 
 3.  Apparent widening of the right upper mediastinal contour, although
 probably technique-related.  Comparison to prior radiographs is suggested as
 well as acquisition of standard PA and lateral views, when clinically
 appropriate.
