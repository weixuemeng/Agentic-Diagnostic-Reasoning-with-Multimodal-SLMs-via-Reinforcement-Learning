                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette with pericardial drain now
 in place.  No evidence of pneumopericardium or pneumothorax.  Worsening left
 retrocardiac opacity is probably a combination of atelectasis and effusion. 
 There may also be a small pleural effusion on the right, as the lateral
 costophrenic angle is less well defined than on the previous exam.
