                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  New diagnosis of complete heart block, now status post pacemaker. 
 Question change.
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph shows a pacing device over the left upper
 chest with intact leads in unchanged position compared to the immediate
 post-placement chest radiograph from ___ at 2:15 p.m.  Accounting for
 differences in technique, there is no change in appearance of central
 pulmonary vasculature, which is not congested.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Again noted is calcification in the thoracic aorta and second
 linear calcification corresponding to left upper lobe bronchus.  No fracture
 or focal parenchymal consolidation is seen.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Expected appearance of status post pacemaker insertion, with no
 pneumonia or edema evident.
