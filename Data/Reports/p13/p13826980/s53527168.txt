                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-traumatic injury, now intubated.
 
 Comparison radiographs available from ___ through ___, and CT torso from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are underinflated, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  An endotracheal tube terminates 6.0 cm above the
 carina.  No large effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 heart size is top normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged.  Bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible
 with atelectasis. There is persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion with
 mild edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube terminating 6.0 cm above the carina.  Unchanged mild
 pulmonary edema.
