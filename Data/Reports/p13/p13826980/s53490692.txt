                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent adjustment of ET tube and placement of NG tube.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, the ET tube has been retracted and now
 lies approximately 1.5 cm above the carina, immediately below the level of the
 clavicles, on this lordotic film. An NG tube is present, tip over fundus.
 
 The left mainstem bronchus is poorly visualized and there is increased opacity
 in the retrocardiac region consistent with left lower lobe (?medial and/or
 upper segments) collapse and/or consolidation. The appearance is similar,
 possibly slightly worse, compared with the earlier film.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the right base, with an elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No gross
 left effusion.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube has been retracted slightly, although only 14 mm above the carina.
 It lies at the lower edge of the medial clavicles.
 
 2.  Marked left perihilar consolidation as described, probably slightly worse
 compared with earlier the same day.  Nonvisualization of the left mainstem
 bronchus.
 
 3.  NG tube in satisfactory position.
