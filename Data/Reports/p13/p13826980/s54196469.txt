                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present. The carina is not optimally delineated, but the ETT tip
 appears to lie above the level of the clavicles and approximately 7 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for technique, cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There is
 minimal upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by supine technique. 
 Allowing for this, I doubt CHF.  There is some increased retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Given the
 level of inspiration, atelectasis would be expected.  No effusion is
 identified.
