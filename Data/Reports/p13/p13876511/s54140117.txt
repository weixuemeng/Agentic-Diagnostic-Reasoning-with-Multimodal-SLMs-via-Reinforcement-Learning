                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain that began yesterday.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Projecting
 over the region of the posterior right eighth rib, there is a 6 mm rounded
 calcified nodule most likely representing a calcified granuloma.  The
 remainder of the lungs is clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  There is minimal prominence of the ascending aorta which
 could be due to tortuosity; however, mild dilatation is not excluded and if of
 clinical concern, could be further evaluated on chest CT.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Likely right lower lung calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidations or
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Slight prominence of the ascending aorta may relate to tortuosity although
 mild dilatation is not excluded and could be further evaluated for on CT,
 urgency depending on patient's symptoms.
