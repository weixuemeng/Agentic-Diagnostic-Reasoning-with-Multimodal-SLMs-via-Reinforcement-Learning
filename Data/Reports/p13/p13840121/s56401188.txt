                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size for technique.
 Lungs are clear.  Hazy opacities at the bases are related to overlying soft
 tissue of the chest wall in this patient with obese body habitus.  If there
 remains clinical suspicion for infection, standard PA and lateral radiographs
 may be helpful for more complete evaluation of the lung bases.
