                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged but similar.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low which result in crowding of
 bronchovascular structures.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases ___ reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is apparent.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
