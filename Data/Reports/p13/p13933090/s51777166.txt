                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of severe CHF with
 increased edema, no weight change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy, bypass surgery,
 permanent pacer with dual intracavitary electrode system is unchanged. 
 Moderate widening and elongation of thoracic aorta with calcium deposits in
 the wall, as before.  The overall heart size has increased slightly when
 comparing the frontal views.  The lateral view again demonstrates some calcium
 deposits at the aortic valve area.  These findings have not progressed
 markedly.  Pulmonary vasculature does not demonstrate any acute vascular
 congestive pattern nor is there any evidence of acute interstitial or central
 alveolar edema.  In comparison with the next previous study, the only sign of
 some increased chronic congestion is a very mild degree of blunting of the
 left lateral pleural sinus that did not exist on the previous examination. 
 Right-sided pleuritic scar formation remains unchanged in appearance and there
 is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.  Nowhere in the lung fields
 is there any sign of a new pulmonary parenchymal pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild progression of heart size and development of small
 left-sided pleural effusion but the examination does not show any findings
 that would match the clinical description of severe CHF.  No acute pulmonary
 infiltrates of pneumonic appearance.
