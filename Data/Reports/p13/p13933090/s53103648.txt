                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe opacity and hemoptysis, evaluation after
 diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in extent and severity of the pre-existing right lower lobe opacity.  A subtle
 new opacity has appeared at the bases of the right upper lobe.  In turn, the
 pre-described left perihilar opacity is minimally decreased in severity and
 extent.
 
 Unchanged position of the pacemaker and its leads.  Unchanged mild
 cardiomegaly.  Unchanged bilateral symmetrical apical thickening.
