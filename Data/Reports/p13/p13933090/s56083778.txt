                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD
 device appears unchanged with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 ventricle, respectively, without change.  The heart appears mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta shows unfolding and mural calcification.  Hemidiaphragms are
 flattened.  There is probably a small pleural effusion on the right and a
 slightly larger one on the left, as well as increased thickening along the
 minor fissure.  Although this finding suggests a component of fluid overload,
 focal opacities projecting over the right lower and left upper lungs are most
 suggestive of pneumonia with areas of spared lung elsewhere.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is unchanged.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.  Small pleural
 effusions.
