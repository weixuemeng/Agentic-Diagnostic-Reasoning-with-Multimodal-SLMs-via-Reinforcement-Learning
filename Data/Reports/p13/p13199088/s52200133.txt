                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endometrial cancer, to assess for metastases.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits, and there is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 coarseness of interstitial markings suggesting some chronic pulmonary disease.
 Pectus excavatum is again seen on lateral view.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary or skeletal metastases.
