                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and recent necrotizing pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Dense irregular opacity within the right upper lobe is re-
 demonstrated with somewhat improved aeration compared to the prior study from
 ___.  The quantity of opacity which reflects scar versus active
 infection is somewhat difficult to determine.  No additional opacities are
 seen with near complete clearing of the left lung opacities.  Trace right
 pleural effusion is noted.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable
 aside from upward traction of the right hilum.  Left PICC terminates in the
 distal SVC.  Feeding tube terminates in the upper stomach.  Of note, the
 weighted dense tip is not identified on the current examination.  It is
 uncertain if it is fractured or if the tube was unchanged to one without a
 weighted tip.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Irregular right upper lung opacity with intervally improved peripheral
 aeration.  It is difficult to assess how much of this is scarring versus
 active infection, though in total there is interval improvement from the prior
 study.  Trace to small right effusion is also improved. Near complete
 resolution of left lung opacities.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube does not project with the weighted tip as was seen on the
 prior study.  Correlate with history of changed tube to determine whether tube
 is fractured.
