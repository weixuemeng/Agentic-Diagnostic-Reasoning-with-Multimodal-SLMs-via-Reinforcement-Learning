                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post cardiac arrest, intubated,
 right upper lobe pneumonia and pneumothorax status post right chest tube. 
 Study requested for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube terminates 6 centimeters above the carina.  A
 right IJ venous catheter terminates in the mid-to-lower SVC.  An enteric tube
 terminates in the gastric fundus.  A chest tube terminates in the right apex.
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is a
 persistent lateral and right inferior pneumothorax.  Right upper lobe
 consolidation has not changed acutely, however there has been improvement when
 compared to prior chest radiograph from ___.  Vascular branching
 pattern on the left suggests emphysema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits. There is improved subcutaneous emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent moderate right basilar pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Unchanged right upper lobe consolidation, for which further evaluation
 with chest CT is recommended to fully characterize and determine whether it
 represents an abscess, hematoma and/or mass.
