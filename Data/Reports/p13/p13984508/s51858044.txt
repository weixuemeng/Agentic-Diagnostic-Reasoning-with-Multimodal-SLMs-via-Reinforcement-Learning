                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right upper lobe
 consolidation ventricle fibrillation, arrest, adjustment of the chest tubes.
 
 As compared to the prior study obtained on ___ there is no
 substantial change in the right upper lobe consolidation.  There is slight
 interval progression of interstitial prominence of the left lung that might
 reflect interstitial edema, although progression of infection is a
 possibility.  On the other hand, there is additional interval decrease in the
 subcutaneous air.
