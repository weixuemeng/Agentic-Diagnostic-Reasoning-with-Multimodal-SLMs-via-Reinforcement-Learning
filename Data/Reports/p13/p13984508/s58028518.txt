                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: ___ year old female patient intubated. Study requested for
 evaluation of ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON: Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 9:14. 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograh from ___, an
 endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Right IJ venous catheter
 tip terminates in the mid to lower SVC. Right upper lobe mass persists,
 overlying translucency could be stimulated by overlying subcutaneous
 emphysema. This finding, however raises the possibility of abscess formation.
 There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema. Today's examination does not cover
 the complete right upper abdomen, however the appearance of a previously
 described right pneumothorax is probably unchanged. There is no pulmonary
 congestion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.
 
 2. Right upper lobe mass with overlying translucency, raises the possibility
 of abscess formation. Further evaluation is recommended with chest CT.
 
 3. Probably unchanged right pneumothorax, not fully imaged in this
 examination.
