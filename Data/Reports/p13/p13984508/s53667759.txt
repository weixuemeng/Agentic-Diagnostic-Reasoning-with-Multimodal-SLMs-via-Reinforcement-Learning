                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Apical pneumothorax, right chest tube placement in a
 patient with ventricular fibrillation and arrest.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  The ET
 tube tip is most likely 7 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is
 at the level of the right main pulmonary artery.  There is evidence of right
 upper lung extensive consolidation, most likely substantial pneumonia. 
 Extensive subcutaneous air is demonstrated as well as the presence of right
 chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Widespread opacities in the
 lower lobes are noted as well and might reflect infectious process.
