                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 2:56 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right upper lobe pneumonia, pneumothorax, and
 two chest tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild interstitial edema in the left lung, improved.  Torso CT on ___
 showed moderate emphysema in the left lung, explaining the heterogenous
 texture of the lungs.   Dense consolidation in the right upper lobe has
 improved minimally since chest radiographs earlier in this admission, though
 not since ___.  The volume of right pleural effusion is underestimated by
 the conventional chest radiograph compared to the CT scan, but it is stable
 and no more than moderate in size and a small amount of fissural pleural fluid
 lies in the right major fissure.  Heart size is normal.  Two right pleural
 tubes are unchanged in their respective positions.  ET tube, left internal
 jugular and right internal jugular lines are in standard placements.  The
 nasogastric tube still needs to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports
 into the stomach.  No detectable pneumothorax.
