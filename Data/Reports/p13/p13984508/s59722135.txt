                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Two chest tubes in place, on the right, change to
 waterseal.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach.  The ET
 tube tip is approximately 6.5 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip
 is at the right lower pulmonary artery.
 
 After placing the right chest tubes on waterseal, there is no substantial
 change in the appearance of the chest including the subcutaneous air
 collection.  There is still evidence of deep sulcus sign on the right that
 might be consistent with the pneumothorax seen as air below the diaphragm.  No
 other changes demonstrated.
