                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:10 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening respiratory insufficiency, following bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate interstitial edema in the left lung and severe consolidation
 in the right upper lung are unchanged.  There is no appreciable right
 pneumothorax or pleural fluid collection, apical and midlevel pleural tubes
 unchanged in position.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum mildly shifted to
 the right reflects volume loss in both upper and lower lobes.  ET tube, left
 internal jugular catheter, and a dual-channel right jugular dialysis set are
 in standard placements.  Feeding tube barely ends in the upper stomach and
 would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Appropriate notifications were made following
 review of subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review.
