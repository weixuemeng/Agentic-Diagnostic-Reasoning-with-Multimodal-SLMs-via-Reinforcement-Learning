 Eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New consolidation at the left lung base is accompanied by ipsilateral
 mediastinal shift suggesting it is more likely large scale atelectasis rather
 than pneumonia, but infection is not excluded and followup is advised.  Small
 left pleural effusion is likely.  There is no pleural effusion on the right,
 and no pulmonary edema.  Heart is normal size.  No pneumothorax.  Right
 jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
