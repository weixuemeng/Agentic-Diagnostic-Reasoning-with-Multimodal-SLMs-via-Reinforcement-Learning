                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 Dobhoff placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  2 frontal chest radiographs are submitted.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 5:47 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 According to the ordering physician, ___. ___, ___ image showing the feeding
 tube tip projecting over the upper midline, either in the trachea at the level
 of the ET tube tip or in the upper esophagus, was the first image performed in
 the sequence. The second in the sequence shows the feeding tube, wire stylet
 in place, cannulating the left bronchial tree as far as the basal trunk lower
 lobe bronchus. At that point the feeding tube was completely withdrawn and the
 attempt at feeding tube placement was terminated.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or new consolidation on the second image compared to
 the first, and the extent of left infrahilar consolidation is comparable to
 that at 5:47 a.m. today. Right infrahilar consolidation is worse, probably
 atelectasis. Heart size is top- normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
