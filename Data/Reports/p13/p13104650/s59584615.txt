                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left PICC line is
 somewhat difficult to see but appears to extend to the brachiocephalic vein
 several cm away from the junction with the SVC.  Low lung volumes accentuate
 the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  It also may have some
 effect on the indistinctness of mildly engorged pulmonary vessels suggesting
 some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  
 
 Dense calcification of the mitral annulus is again seen.
