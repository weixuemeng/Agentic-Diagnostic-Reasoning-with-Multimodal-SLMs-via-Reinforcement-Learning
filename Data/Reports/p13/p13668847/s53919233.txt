                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with confusion status post fall downstairs. 
 Evaluate for intracranial injury or infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is a right
 chest wall port with the catheter tip terminating in the deep right atrium. 
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There are small bilateral
 effusions. Linear opacities at the left lung base are likely atelectasis
 however aspiration is also possible.  There is a nodular opacity overlying the
 seventh posterior rib on the right, which may represent a nipple shadow or
 alternatively a pulmonary nodule.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Linear opacities at the left lung base are likely atelectasis, however
 aspiration is also possible.
 2.  Nodular opacity in the left lower lung may represent a nipple shadow,
 however, correlation with prior CT imaging would be helpful.
