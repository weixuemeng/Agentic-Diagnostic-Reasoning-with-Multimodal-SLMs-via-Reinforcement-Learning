                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right sided PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  There
 has been interval development of a moderate right pleural effusion and trace
 left pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacification may reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is also likely present.  Mild
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of moderate size right and small left pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis however infection,
 particularly in the right lung base, cannot be completely excluded.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
