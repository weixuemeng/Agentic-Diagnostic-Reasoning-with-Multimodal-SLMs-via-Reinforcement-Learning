                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cancer, neutropenic, history of malignant
 effusions, decreased breath sounds bilaterally
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. Severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is continued mild
 pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size compared to the previous
 study.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, decreased in size compared to the previous exam.  Patchy opacities
 in lung bases may reflect atelectasis.
