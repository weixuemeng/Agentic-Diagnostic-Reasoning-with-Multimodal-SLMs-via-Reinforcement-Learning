                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Mild patchy bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Scarring within the lung apices appears unchanged.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly suggest trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
