                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with NG tube placement.  Assess placement of NG tube .
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG tube is seen coursing over the midline of the chest, with tip and side
 port below the level of the diaphragm, overlying the gastric fundus.  Note is
 made of multiple dilated loops of small bowel in the  left mid/upper abdomen,
 also demonstrated on a abdominal CT obtained earlier the same day.  No free
 air seen beneath the diaphragm.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bilateral lower
 lobe atelectasis.  There is mild vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.   Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung
 volumes and patient positioning. The aorta is tortuous.  Biapical pleural
 thickening and parenchymal scarring is seen.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  NG tube tip in stomach.  Dilated small bowel loops noted.
 2.  Low inspiratory volumes, likely contributing to accentuated
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, bibasilar atelectasis and upper zone right
 redistribution.
 3.  Biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring noted.
