 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Increased intracranial pressure.  Nasogastric tube replaced.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent prior radiograph from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided pneumothorax has continued to decrease in size.  An
 orogastric tube appears to have been pushed forward very slightly.  The
 sidehole marker still projects slightly above the gastroesophageal junction,
 however.  Otherwise, there has been no significant change.
