 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post craniotomy, intubation, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pneumonia at the level
 of the left lower lobe has not substantially changed.  Also unchanged are the
 other rather subtle but multifocal parenchymal opacities.  The left hilus
 continues to be slightly enlarged.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac
 silhouette, unchanged monitoring and support devices.  No pneumothorax.
