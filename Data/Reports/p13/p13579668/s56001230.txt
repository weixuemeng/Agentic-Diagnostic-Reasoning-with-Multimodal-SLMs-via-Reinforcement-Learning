 catheter and right basilar pleural catheters remain in place.  A nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There
 is decrease in thickening of the minor fissure consistent with decreased
 loculated fluid.  Patchy opacity in the left hilar vicinity and in the
 retrocardiac region is again seen and likely not significantly changed,
 possibly representing atelectasis, pneumonia, or aspiration.  Clinical
