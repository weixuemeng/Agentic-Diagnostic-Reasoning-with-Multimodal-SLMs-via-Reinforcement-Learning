 is slight deviation of the mediastinal structures to the left.  Multiple
 surgical clips are present in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Reaccumulation of right pleural effusion, with fluid tracking

 infection cannot be excluded.  Multifocal opacities in the left lung are also
 concerning for infection.
