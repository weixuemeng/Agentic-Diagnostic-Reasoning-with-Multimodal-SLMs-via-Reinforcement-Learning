 bilateral pulmonary nodules are better seen on the prior CT.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Destructive lytic lesions are again
 seen within the right-sided ribs compatible with metastases.  Multiple clips
 are demonstrated within the upper abdomen bilaterally.

 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Post radiation changes in the right
 lower lobe.  Multiple lytic right rib metastases.
