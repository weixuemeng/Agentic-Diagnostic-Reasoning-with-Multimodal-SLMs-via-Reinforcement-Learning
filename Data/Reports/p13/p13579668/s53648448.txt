  No pneumothorax is evident.  There is slight lucency projecting over the left
  costophrenic sulcus is unchanged compared to prior examination and may reflect
  overlying bowel gas.  Stable positioning of left and right chest tubes. 
  Enteric catheter continues to have side port proximal to the GE junction
  should be advanced several centimeters.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3
  centimeters above the carina.  Stable if not slightly increased mild vascular
  congestion.   Minimally increased retrocardiac opacification may reflect
  atelectasis though superimposed aspiration or infection is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post Pleurx catheter, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:03 a.m.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices,
 including the bilateral chest tubes, are unchanged.  There is no convincing
 evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain normal, the
 opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas and at the level of the left hilus
 are unchanged in extent and severity.  No new parenchymal opacities. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
