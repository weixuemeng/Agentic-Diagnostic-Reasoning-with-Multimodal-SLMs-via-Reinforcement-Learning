                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with cerebral edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal, widening of mediastinum has improved.  ET tube is
 in standard position.  NG tube tip is in the stomach, but the side port is in
 the distal esophagus and should be advanced for more standard position.  It
 should be advanced at least 5 cm.  Mild vascular congestion has improved. 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Left chest tube remains in place.  Right
 basal chest tube remains in place.  Blunting of the right lateral CP angle
 could be due to small effusion and/or pleural thickening.  Multiple surgical
 clips project in the left upper abdomen.
