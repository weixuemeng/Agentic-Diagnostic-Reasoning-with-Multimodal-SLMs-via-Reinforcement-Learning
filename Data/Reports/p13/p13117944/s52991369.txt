 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with septic shock due to perforated

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 13:21.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC, near
 the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable.  There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation and more
 patchy opacity at the right base, which may reflect lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Lung volumes overall remain
 somewhat low.  There is likely a layering left effusion.  Overall, there is
 likely not any significant interval change since ___.  No pneumothorax.
