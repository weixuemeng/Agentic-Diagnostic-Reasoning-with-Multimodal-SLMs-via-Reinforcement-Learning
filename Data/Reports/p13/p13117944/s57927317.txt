                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea, to look for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright portable chest radiograph was compared with the
 prior study from ___, acquired approximately ___ hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since prior radiograph, the patient has been extubated and orogastric tube has
 been removed.  Right internal jugular line tip is at lower SVC/cavoatrial
 junction.  Mildly increased lung haziness is probably due to increase in small
 bilateral pleural effusions or could be a function of changes in the lung
 following extubation.  Increased retrocardiac density is minimally worsened
 since yesterday.  Upper lungs remain clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
