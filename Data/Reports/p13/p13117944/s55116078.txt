                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Possible pneumonia in an abdomen film.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is normal.  Small-to-moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the right side, stable.  Bibasilar
 opacities have increased on the left.  This could be due to increasing
 atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Left PICC tip is at the upper to mid SVC.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 9:43 p.m. on ___ at
