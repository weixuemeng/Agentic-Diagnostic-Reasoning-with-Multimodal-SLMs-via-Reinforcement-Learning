 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal distention and recent perforated appendix.  Status post
 nasogastric tube replacement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The heart is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Blunting of
 each costophrenic sulcus suggests likely small pleural effusions.  A
 persistent retrocardiac opacity is similar to the prior study and could be
 seen with atelectasis.  An infectious etiology cannot be excluded, however. 
 No free air is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of nasogastric tube.  Persistent
 retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis and suspected very small
 pleural effusions.
