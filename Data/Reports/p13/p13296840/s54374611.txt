                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of CHF and question
 TIA.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally, which may be due to
 moderate interstitial edema, although chronic underlying interstitial process
 may alternatively be present.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  There is
 moderate-to-severe compression of two vertebral bodies at the thoracolumbar
 junction, of indeterminate age, given lack of priors for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings may relate to interstitial edema,
 although underlying chronic interstitial process may also be present.  No
 pleural effusion or focal consolidation.
 2.  Moderate-to-severe compression of two vertebral bodies at the
 thoracolumbar junction/lower thoracic region, of indeterminate age, given lack
 of priors for comparison.
