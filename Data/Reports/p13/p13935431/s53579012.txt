                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, possible delirium.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Linear opacities within the left lung base likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.
