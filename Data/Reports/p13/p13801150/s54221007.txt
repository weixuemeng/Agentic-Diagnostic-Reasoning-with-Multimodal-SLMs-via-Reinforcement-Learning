                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Scapular pain on the right.  Question fracture, question pulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 well expanded and clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No definite acute osseous injury identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Conventional chest radiograph is not
 sensitive for the detection of chest cage injury, dedicated rib views
 recommended if clinically indicated.
