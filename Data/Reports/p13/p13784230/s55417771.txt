                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Persistent fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear except for
 questionable opacity projecting over the right suprahilar area, not seen on
 the lateral view, potentially might reflect small focus of infection.  Rest of
 the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Repeated
 radiograph to exclude the possibility of infection vs. superposition of the
 structures is recommended and if persistent might be considered a small focus
 of infection.
