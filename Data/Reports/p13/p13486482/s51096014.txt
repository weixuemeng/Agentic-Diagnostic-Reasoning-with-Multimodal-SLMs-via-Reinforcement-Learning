                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma, on chemo, multiple lumbar compression fractures,
 presenting with fall, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with increased AP diameter and flattened
 diaphragms.  This suggests some background COPD.  There is probable mild
 cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.   No definitive
 infiltrate is identified.  There is some increased opacity and coarsened
 markings in the lower lobe posteriorly, ? left lower lobe.  Much of this can
 be accounted for by overlapping vascular and aortic shadows.  No other
 evidence of infiltrate is identified.  Minimal atelectasis at the right lung
 base is present.  No gross effusion.
 
 Multiple rib fractures of varying ages are present on both right and left
 sides of the chest.  As suggested, there is probable diffuse osteopenia with
 compression of multiple vertebral bodies. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Question background COPD.  Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.
 
 2.  Osteopenia with multiple rib and vertebral body fractures and slight
 accentuation of thoracic kyphosis.
 
 3.  No definite infiltrate.  Equivocal increased markings seen in the left
 lower lobe seen on the lateral view could represent atelectasis and/or
 overlap.  An early infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
