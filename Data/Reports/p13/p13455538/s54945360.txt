 A portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs
 and normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  there are small (1-2) mm
 opacities, dense for size seen in each lung that could represent scattered
 grandulomas or scars.  these are dense for their size.  comparison with old
 films would be helpufl.  Contrast is seen in the colon.

 No infiltrate.
