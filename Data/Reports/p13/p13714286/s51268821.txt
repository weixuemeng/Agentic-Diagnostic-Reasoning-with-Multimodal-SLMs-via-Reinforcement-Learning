                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever  // any evidence of pna?      any
 evidence of pna?
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___
 CYST HAMPERED ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic, increased since ___.  Hilar adenopathy,
 significantly calcified, is also long-standing.  Low lung volumes make it
 difficult to exclude minimal pulmonary edema.  Large asbestos related pleural
 plaques overlie some areas of both lungs.  There is no large region of
 pulmonary abnormality that clearly suggests pneumonia, but a lateral view is
 essential, and CT scanning may ultimately be required.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs, PA and lateral.  Consider
 CT scanning after that.
