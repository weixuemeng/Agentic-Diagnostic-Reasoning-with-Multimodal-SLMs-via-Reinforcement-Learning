                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent lymphoma, right sided dyspnea, pleuritic
 pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  A large right pleural
 effusion, with a loculated visual component has increased in size from the
 previous study.  There is continued right basilar opacity likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is slightly limited due to
 the presence of the large pleural effusion, but appears mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged, with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy
 better assessed on recent PET CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Left lung
 is clear.  No left-sided pleural effusion is present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of large right pleural effusion, with a component loculated in
 the fissure and continued right basilar atelectasis.  Mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is better assessed on recent PET-CT.
