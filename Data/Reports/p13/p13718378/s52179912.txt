                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with atrial fibrillation with stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT ___.
 
 PORTABLE CHEST
 
 There is extensive pleural thickening and calcification involving the right
 lower hemithorax, with associated volume loss and increased opacity of the
 right lung.  There are additional extensive pericardial calcifications.  There
 is a possible parenchymal opacity at the right lung base, though it is unclear
 whether this represents additional pleural abnormality or more likely
 associated atelectasis.  The right upper lung zone and left lung remain clear.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 and there is widening of the mediastinal contours, incompletely evaluated
 though likely reflecting adenopathy seen on chest CT.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive pleural thickening and pleural calcification in the right
 hemithorax with associated volume loss and pericardial calcification, as seen
 on prior chest CT, most likely the sequelae of prior pleuropericarditis.
 
 2.  Added opacity at the right lung base, which could represent additional
 pleural abnormality or atelectasis, though if there is concern for pnuemonia,
 radiographic followup is recommended.
 
 3.  Mediastinal widening, likely reflecting adenopathy seen on recent chest
 CT.
