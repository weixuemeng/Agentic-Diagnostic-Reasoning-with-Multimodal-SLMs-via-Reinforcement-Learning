                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The right cardiac border is slightly
 obscured which suggests minimal opacification in the right middle lobe,
 although suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Central airways bilaterally are
 suggestive of airway inflammation, but otherwise the lungs appear clear.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of airway inflammation including suspected
 slight right middle lobe atelectasis.  No definite pneumonia.  If pneumonia is
 suspected clinically; however, then short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful to evaluate further.
