 retrocardiac opacity than right basilar opacity.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Chronic left lateral
 fourth and fifth rib fractures are noted, in part creating opacity projecting
 over left upper lung laterally.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
