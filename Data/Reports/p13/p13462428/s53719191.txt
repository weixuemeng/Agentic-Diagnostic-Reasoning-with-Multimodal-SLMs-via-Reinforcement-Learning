                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a patchy infiltrate in the right mid lung zone, which is
 not definitely identified on the lateral view.  This is most consistent with
 pneumonia.  There is minimal atelectasis intending at the right lung base,
 best appreciated on the lateral view.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right mid lung zone opacity, most likely pneumonia. 
 Recommend repeat radiograph after treatment to ensure resolution.
