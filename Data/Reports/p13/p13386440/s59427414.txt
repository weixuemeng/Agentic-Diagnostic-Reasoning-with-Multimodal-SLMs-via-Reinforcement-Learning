                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent left middle lobe pneumonia on cipro here
 with generalized weakness and bilateral crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, thoracic spine radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Pleural calcification is
 again noted on the lateral view suggestive of prior asbestos exposure. 
 Minimal patchy opacity is seen within the left lung base, as seen previously
 on the chest radiograph from ___ and the thoracic spine radiograph from
 ___, which likely reflects this pleural calcification en face.  There
 is no new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus suggests the presence of a trace left pleural effusion. 
 Scarring is noted within the lung apices.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pleural calcifications, as noted on the prior thoracic spine radiograph from
 ___, suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.  The patchy left basilar
 opacity also appears similar from the previous examinations and likely
 reflects the pleural calcification seen en face.  No new focal consolidation
 present.
