                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema, question pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Diffuse increased interstitial markings are again
 seen, similar prior exam and consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 Focal consolidative areas are seen in the right lung base, right upper lung,
 left perihilar region, which may represent focal areas of pulmonary edema vs.
 multifocal pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, similar to
 prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 mildly enlarged, stable from prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  
 
 2.  Bilateral focal consolidations, which may represent focal areas of
 pulmonary edema vs. multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend continued radiographic
 surveillance.
 
 3.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
