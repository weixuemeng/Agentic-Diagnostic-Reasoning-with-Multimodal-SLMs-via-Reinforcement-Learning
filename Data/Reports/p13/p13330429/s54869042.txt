                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status and speech
 difficulties.  History of multiple sclerosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Low lung volumes seen on the
 current exam, similar to prior.  There are new bilateral increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs with more confluent consolidation
 at the right lung base and over the right upper lung.  The lateral view
 demonstrates moderate likely bilateral effusions.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged but similar compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. 
 More focal consolidation in the right lower lung could be due to superimposed
 atelectasis, although infection would also be possible.
