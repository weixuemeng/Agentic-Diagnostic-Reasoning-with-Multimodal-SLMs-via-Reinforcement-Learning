                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dementia with unwitnessed fall. Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with increased
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even
 allowing for this, the heart is likely at least mildly enlarged.  No definite
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, with likely mild cardiomegaly. No focal consolidation
 identified.
