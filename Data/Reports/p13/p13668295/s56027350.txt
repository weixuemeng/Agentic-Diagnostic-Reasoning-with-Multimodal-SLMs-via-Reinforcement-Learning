                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bladder cancer  // ? lung mets
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are remarkable for a
 tortuous thoracic aorta and moderate sized hiatal hernia. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No conventional radiographic evidence of pulmonary metastases.  CT is more
 sensitive than radiography for detecting small pulmonary nodules and may be
 considered for more complete assessment if warranted clinically.
