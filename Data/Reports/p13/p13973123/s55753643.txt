 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dysphasia and epigastric pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  Surgical clips project
 about the expected site of the gastroesophageal junction.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The heart is normal in size.
 There is very similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear aside
 from a linear right middle lobe opacity suggesting minor scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
