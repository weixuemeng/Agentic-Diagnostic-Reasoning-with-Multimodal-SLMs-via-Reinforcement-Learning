                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with rigors, leukocytosis, possible
 aspiration, evaluate for aspiration versus pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  Status post sternotomy
 related to bypass surgery as before.  Heart size remains normal.  Thoracic
 aorta generally widened and elongated but no interval change is noted.  The
 previously described right-sided mass in the right superior mediastinum
 occupying the right tracheobronchial angle remains unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 has developed.  As before, there are pulmonary findings compatible with COPD
 but the on previous examination identified left-sided basal infiltrates and
 linear atelectasis have clearly regressed.  No new abnormalities are seen, and
 the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid
 accumulation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiovascular, pulmonary findings, however, previously
 identified density on left base has regressed suggesting that pulmonary event
 may have been caused by an aspiration.
