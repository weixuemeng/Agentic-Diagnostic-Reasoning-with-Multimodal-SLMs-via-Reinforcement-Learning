                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with lung cancer and failure to thrive with
 leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased opacity in the right upper lung with air bronchograms is
 concerning for pneumonia.  The left lung is clear aside from left basilar
 atelecatsis.  The known right upper lobe mass is again seen.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 free air under the diaphragm. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 noted. Radioopaque foreign bodies project over the right mid lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe opacity is likely pneumonia, possibly post
 obstructive in the setting of known right upper lobe mass.
