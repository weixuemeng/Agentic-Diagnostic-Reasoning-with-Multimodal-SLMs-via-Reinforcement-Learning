                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough since weekend, low oxygen
 saturation, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  The heart is mildly enlarged with a relative
 prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly, but no
 significant enlargement of the left atrium can be identified.  The thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated with calcium deposits in the wall,
 mostly at the level of the arch.  No local contour abnormality can be
 identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and there are no
 signs of acute parenchymal infiltrates.  Comparison with the next previous
 study demonstrates unchanged appearance of the previously described left basal
 pleural and parenchymal densities, most likely representing scar formations as
 they are completely unchanged, and no new infiltrates can be identified. 
 Previously noted patchy infiltrates on the right lung base occupying the
 posterior segment have now resolved.  Thus, at the present time, there is no
 evidence of any acute infiltrate or significant congestion.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the skeletal structures, as before, accentuated kyphotic
 curvature in the thoracic spine but no evidence of new vertebral body
 compression.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in elderly female patient, no evidence of
 new acute parenchymal infiltrates and no signs of advanced CHF.
