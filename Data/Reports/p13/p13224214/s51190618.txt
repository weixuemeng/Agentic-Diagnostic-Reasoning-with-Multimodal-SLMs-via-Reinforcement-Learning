                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP PORTABLE CHEST, ___ WITH COMPARISON RADIOGRAPH OF ___
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax, or acute, displaced rib
 fracture.  Please note that portable chest radiographs are relatively
 insensitive for detecting anterior rib fractures.  Stable appearance of
 cardiomediastinal contours.  Worsening linear opacities at left base
 suggestive of atelectasis with or without a component of preexisting scarring.
 No definite pleural effusion.
