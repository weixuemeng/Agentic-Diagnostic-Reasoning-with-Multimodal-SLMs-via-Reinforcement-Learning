                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 left greater than right bibasilar opacities most consistent with
 atelectasis/scarring.  There is slight increase in interstitial markings
 bilaterally, new since the prior study, which may be due to mild interstitial
 edema, although atypical infection is not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
