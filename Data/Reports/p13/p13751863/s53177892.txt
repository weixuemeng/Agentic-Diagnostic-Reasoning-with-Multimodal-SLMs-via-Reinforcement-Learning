                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, needing oxygen requirement and
 decreased breath sounds at left base.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There is mild interstitial edema.  Left
 Port-A-Catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There is a new opacity in the left
 upper lobe.  This could be due to infectious process but a lung abnormality
 related to lymphoma cannot be totally excluded.  Attention in this area is
 recommended.
