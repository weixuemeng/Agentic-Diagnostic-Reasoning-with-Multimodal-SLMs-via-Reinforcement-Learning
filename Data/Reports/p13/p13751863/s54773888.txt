                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hyperglycemia and altered mental status.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the lower SVC.  The
 heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lungs are clear of lobar consolidation with plate-like
 atelectasis or scarring along the major fissure than in the lower lateral lung
 zones bilaterally.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely represents
 a small-to-moderate pleural fluid versus thickening.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is no change from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia; probable small-to-moderate
 right pleural effusion versus thickening which is unchanged.
