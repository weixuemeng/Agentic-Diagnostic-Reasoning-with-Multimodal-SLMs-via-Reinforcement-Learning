                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, hyperglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, with
 similar appearance of either right lower lateral pleural thickening or
 laterally loculated effusion.  Linear opacities in both lung bases, which may
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring, are unchanged.  No new lung
 opacification is demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse
 demineralization of the osseous structures is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little interval change from the prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 and bibasilar linear opacities either reflecting subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring, unchanged.
