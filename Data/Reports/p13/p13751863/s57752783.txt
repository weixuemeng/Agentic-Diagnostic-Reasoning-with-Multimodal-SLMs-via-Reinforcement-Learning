                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with lymphoma, status post diuresis due to
 pulmonary edema.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Aeration of the right lung base is
 slightly improved, though opacification persists.  There is blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle suggestive of persistent small left pleural effusion. 
 Linear opacities within the left mid lung appear unchanged, corresponding with
 an area of scarring.  There is unchanged mild pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 A left Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Persistent bibasilar opacities, though with slight improved aeration of
 the right lung base.  
 2.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
