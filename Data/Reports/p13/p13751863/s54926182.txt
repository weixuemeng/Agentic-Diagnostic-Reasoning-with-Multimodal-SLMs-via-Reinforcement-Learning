 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, status post
 diuresis, assess change in pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The left chest
 wall Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with catheter tip in the expected
 region of the low SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small in size, persist. 
 There is pulmonary interstitial edema which appears slightly increased from
 prior exam.  Lower lung opacities could represent atelectasis, though the
 possibility of pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The heart is top normal in size.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased pulmonary edema and small persistent pleural
 effusions.  Lower lung opacities appear increased, could represent atelectasis
 or possibly pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly unchanged.
