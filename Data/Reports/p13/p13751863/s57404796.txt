                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and confusion, hyperglycemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath is stable in position with catheter terminating in the
 distal SVC.  There is interval increase in the right-sided pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis, right base consolidation is difficult to exclude. 
 There is also patchy opacity projecting over the right middle lobe which may
 relate to atelectasis although again underlying infection is not excluded. 
 There is mild diffuse increase in interstitial markings suggesting mild to
 moderate interstitial edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, right
 mid to lower lung consolidation or infection not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
