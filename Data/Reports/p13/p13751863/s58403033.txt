                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Right pleural effusion has markedly decreased, now is small.  There is no
 evident pneumothorax, but conventional PA and lateral views are recommended
 when feasible.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The left lung is
 clear.  Port-A-Cath is in standard position.  Right lower lobe opacities are
 likely atelectasis.
