                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change in
 the appearance of the right pleural fluid with opacification running up along
 the lateral chest wall.  On the lateral view, the configuration raises the
 possibility of an extrapleural or loculated collection.
 
 Fibrotic streaks are again seen at the bases and the central catheter remains
 in place.
