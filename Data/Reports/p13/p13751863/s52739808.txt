                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoglycemia, neutropenia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  On a background of mild pulmonary
 edema, there are stable bibasilar opacifications including a domed posterior
 pleural based opacification likely reflecting rounded atelectasis. There is
 stable prominence of the right lateral pleura, likely combination of small
 loculated pleural fluid and pleural thickening. Small amount of fluid tracks
 along the minor fissure.  No pneumothorax evident.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath
 terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema. Stable-appearing bibasilar opacifications
 are likely atelectasis though cannot exclude superimposed infectious process.
