                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe crackles.  Evaluation for pneumonia or pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT chest ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate compression
 fractures involving the T5 and T8 vertebral bodies. Of note, the T8 vertebral
 has worsened compared to ___.  The lung volumes are low with probable
 bibasilar atelectasis, particularly along the right heart border, where there
 is some increase in conjunction with reduced lung volumes.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite pneumonia; suspected atelectasis in the right infrahilar
 region, perhaps somewhat increased in association with reduced lung volumes.
 
 2.  Worsening T8 compression fracture compared to ___.
