 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulmonary hypertension, chronic heart failure, shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the aorta and slight
 enlargement of the right hilus.  This is likely due to pulmonary artery
 enlargement in the context of clinically evident pulmonary hypertension. 
 Minimal right pleural effusion.  No left pleural effusion.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Minimal areas of atelectasis at the right lung
 base.
