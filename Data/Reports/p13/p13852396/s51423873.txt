                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lower back pain and weakness, noted to have low-grade fever and
 leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. 
 Evaluation of the frontal projection is limited secondary to technique,
 although no definite focal consolidation is seen.  On the lateral projection,
 linear opacities overlying the lower thoracic spine could represent crowding
 of the bronchovascular bundles and degenerative changes in the spine although
 an infectious process in this region of either lower lobe cannot be excluded. 
 There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Coronary artery
 calcifications are noted. Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
 spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite focal consolidation.  Linear opacities projecting
 over the lower thoracic spine on the lateral radiograph are thought to
 represent crowding of the bronchovascular bundles and overlying osseous
 structures, although an infectious process in either lower lobe cannot be
 excluded.  If concern for an infectious process persists, further evaluation
 could be performed with a standard PA frontal radiograph.
