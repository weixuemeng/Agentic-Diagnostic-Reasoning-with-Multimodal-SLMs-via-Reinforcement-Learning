                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  High fever of unclear etiology.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is slight
 prominence of the left hilum on the frontal view which is likely due to
 overlap of vascular structures, although underlying mild hilar lymphadenopathy
 is not entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Clear lungs.  Slight prominence of the left hilum on the frontal
 views\ only, not well seen on the lateral view, most likely due to overlying
 vascular structures; however, in the appropriate clinical setting hilar
 lymphadenopathy cannot be entirely excluded.
