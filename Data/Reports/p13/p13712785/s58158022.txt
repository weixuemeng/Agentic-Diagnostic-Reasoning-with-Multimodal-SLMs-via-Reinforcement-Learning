                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no evident right effusion.
 There appears to be a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Extensive bilateral
 opacities have slightly increased in the right upper lobe.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in the standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the low SVC.  NG tube tip
 is in the stomach with sideport at the EG junction.  A second tube is coiled
 outside the field of view and the tip projects in the fundus of the stomach. 
 This is unchanged from prior study.  Right pigtail catheter is in unchanged
 position.
