                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval replacement of right pigtail pleural catheter with tip now
 terminating near the right apex.  Moderate-sized right apicolateral
 pneumothorax appears slightly larger than on the prior study.  Otherwise,
 relatively similar appearance of the chest compared to the previous study from
 earlier the same date.
