                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient, status post multiple surgeries.  Patient
 with concern of volvulus versus SBO.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 ET tube is in the standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view below the
 diaphragm.  Left subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, slightly shifted
 towards the left.  Bilateral pleural effusions are less conspicuous than
 before likely due to change in positioning of the patient.  Excessive
 bilateral opacities have minimally improved in the upper lobes and perihilar
 regions, stable in the left lower lobe.  Increase in atelectasis is seen in
 the right lower lobe.
