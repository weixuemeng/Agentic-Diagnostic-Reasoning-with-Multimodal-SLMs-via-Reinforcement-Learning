                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory failure, aspiration, assessment for
 interval change.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier.
 
 The current examination demonstrates the process of attempt to place an NG
 tube.  After  malpositioning of the NG tube toward the right lower lobe
 bronchus, it has been removed.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. 
 Right upper lobe consolidation and diffuse opacities within the lungs are
 re-demonstrated.  The small bilateral pleural effusions are re-demonstrated. 
 The tracheostomy and the right subclavian line tip are unchanged in
 appearance.  Bibasal atelectasis and pneumothorax are present.
