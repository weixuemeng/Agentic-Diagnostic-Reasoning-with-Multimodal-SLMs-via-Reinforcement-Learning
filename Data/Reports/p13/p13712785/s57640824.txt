 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, assess ET tube status post
 bronchoscopy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 The ET tube is in a standard position.  The tip is 4.4 cm above the carina. 
 Diffuse extensive bilateral opacities have minimally improved on the right
 upper lobe.  Otherwise, there are no interval changes from prior study.
