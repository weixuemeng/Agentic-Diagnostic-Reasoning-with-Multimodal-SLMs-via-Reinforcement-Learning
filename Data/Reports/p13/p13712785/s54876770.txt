                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax after chest tube placement for pleural effusion. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ and ___, as well as CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, nasogastric
 tube, a right PICC, and a right chest pigtail catheter, all of which are
 unchanged in position.  The previously seen small right pneumothorax is now
 largely replaced by fluid at the apex.  Heterogeneous consolidations of the
 right lung, upper lobe greater than lower lobe, are again seen and unchanged. 
 There is atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  The remainder of the exam is
 unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Previously seen small right pneumothorax is now largely replaced by fluid at
 the apex.
