                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increasing shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 change in pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___

 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral
 parenchymal opacities which have progressed over the interval from the prior
 study, and may represent ARDS or pneumonia.  Allowing for patient positioning,
 the left-sided pleural effusion appears stable in size.  The cardiac
 silhouette continues to be obscured.  There is no pneumothorax.  A nasogastric
 tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.  A left-sided
 subclavian central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent
 with ARDS and/or pneumonia.  Stable-appearing left-sided pleural effusion.
 
 COMMENTS: These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 10:18am on ___, 10 minutes after discovery.
