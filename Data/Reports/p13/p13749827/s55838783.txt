                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p moped accident, bilateral SAH, 6th rib fx, L
 orbital fx.  // Evaluate L 6th rib fx, eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest, two views including lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:19.  Targeted view of chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ___ CT showed a fracture of the posteromedial left sixth rib.  On
 the current chest x-ray, this is very subtly visible as minimal cortical
 offset.  No significant displacement is detected on the available views.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion.  There is
 subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 No CHF.  No obvious pneumothorax.
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:19, I doubt overt interval change.  No new
 infiltrate identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased retrocardiac opacity, similar to ___.  Differential
 diagnosis includes atelectasis and/or a pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study.
 
 Probable atelectasis at the right base, not significantly changed.
 
 As seen on the current study, the posterior medial sixth rib fracture appears
 only very minimally displaced, in keeping with findings on the ___ CT
 scan.
