                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new line placement  // ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-___ ___ ___ earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with the prior film, a new right IJ central line is present, tip
 overlying distal SVC. There is a relative paucity of vascular markings at the
 both lung apices -- this likely represents normal variation in this
 individual. No line of demarcation to suggest a pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is the somewhat rounded focal opacity in the right upper lobe
 laterally, consistent with full consolidation, with minimal atelectasis at the
 right and left lung bases. No new focal infiltrate and no effusion is
 detected. No CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right IJ line, with tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Focal opacity in the right midzone again noted, similar to the film
 obtained earlier today.
