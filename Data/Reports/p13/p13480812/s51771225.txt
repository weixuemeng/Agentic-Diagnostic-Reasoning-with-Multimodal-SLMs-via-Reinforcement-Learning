                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with HIV, hepatitis C, hep C, asthma and
 chest pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  There is a
 poorly defined opacity at the left lung base, which could reflect crowding of
 bronchovasculature and underpenetrated technique, though the possibility of an
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Consider dedicated PA and lateral view to
 better assess.  No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size
 appears grossly stable.  No mediastinal contour abnormalities are seen.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left lung base could represent crowding of
 bronchovasculature though in the correct clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  If needed, a dedicated PA and lateral view may be obtained to
 further assess.
