                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with HIV and pneumonia, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 AP single view chest examination of ___.  On the present examination,
 the heart size is unchanged and within normal limits.  No configurational
 abnormality is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The on
 previous single view chest examination identified right lower lobe area hazy
 infiltrate has disappeared.  No new abnormalities are seen in the right
 hemithorax.  On the other hand, there is now a smaller hazy infiltrate on the
 left-sided lung base and the lateral view suggests it is located in the
 periphery of the left upper lobe lingula abutting the heart border.  No
 development of pleural effusions and no pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Regression of previously identified right lower lobe infiltrate
 but development of a smaller left-sided lingula infiltrate during the same
 interval.  Considering patient's history of HIV, PCP infection IS included in
 the diagnostic list.
