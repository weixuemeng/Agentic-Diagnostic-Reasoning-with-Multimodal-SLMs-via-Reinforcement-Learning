                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Sepsis, RUQ abdominal pain  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Sever previous chest x-rays from ___ through ___. Targeted review of chest ct from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large, somewhat rounded,  area of focal opacity in the lateral
 portion of the right upper lobe, abutting the minor fissure, with equivocal
 associated air bronchograms. Possible minimal atelectasis at the right base.
 Otherwise, no focal infiltrates or consolidations are identified.
 
 No CHF or effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.
 
 The current radiograph suggests mild right convex curvature of the thoracic
 spine centered at T4/5 --___ thoracic spine curvature was probably subtly
 present on ___.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal opacity in the right upper lobe, abutting the minor fissure, new
 compared with the chest x-ray dated ___.  The appearance is most
 suggestive of a pneumonic consolidation.  If clinically indicated, a lateral
 view could help to more completely delineate the size and area of involvement.
 Followup imaging to confirm complete resolution and to exclude underlying
 abnormality would be strongly recommended.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly. The cardiac silhouette is slightly more pronounced than
 on the ___ chest x-ray.
