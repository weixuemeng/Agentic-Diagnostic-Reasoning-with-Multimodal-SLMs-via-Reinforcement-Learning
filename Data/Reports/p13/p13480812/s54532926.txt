                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, in keeping with history of asthma.  Since the
 prior study, there are streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases which may
 be due to bronchial wall thickening, small airways disease without discrete
 lobar consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstrated hyperinflated lungs.  New streaky opacities at the lung bases
 may be due to small airways disease/bronchial wall thickening, without
 definite lobar consolidation.
