                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is hazy increased opacity of the right lung base, slightly
 increased from prior.   It is impossible to tell whether this represents a
 recurrent process of failure to clear of the prior infection.  Increase
 opacity at the left lung base is new. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Hilar
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increased opacity of the right lung base is likely pneumonia,
 whether acute or persistent is unknown.  New opacity at the left lung base is
 also worrisome for pneumonia.  A lateral view could help in further
 evaluation.
 
 These findings were paged to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 6:36 on ___.
