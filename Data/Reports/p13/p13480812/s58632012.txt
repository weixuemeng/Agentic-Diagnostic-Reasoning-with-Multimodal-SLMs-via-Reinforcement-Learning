                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDING:  Streaky linear opacification in the right base corresponds to some
 linear scarring or atelectasis as previously seen on the CT of the chest. 
 There is a new hazy opacity at the left base.  The upper lobes are clear. 
 There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Hazy opacity at the left base which likely represent pneumonia.  Recommend
 follow-up with a repeat radiograph in 4 weeks to ensure resolution after
 treatment.
 2.  Linear opacity at the right base appears stable, and is likely scarring or
 atelectasis.
