                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided rib and flank pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There are vague nodular densities projecting over each mid lung, probably
 nipple shadows.  Streaky basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Vague bilateral nodular densities,
 probably nipple shadows.  When clinically appropriate, confirmation with an
 additional PA view using nipple markers is recommended.  An email regarding
 the recommendation was sent the ED ___ nursing group on ___.
