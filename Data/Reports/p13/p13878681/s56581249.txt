                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with persistent cough, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar chest examination of ___.  There is status post
 sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the left anterior
 mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  The configuration identified prominence of the left
 ventricular contour to the left and posteriorly and a mild prominence of the
 left atrial contour is also seen on the lateral view.  The pulmonary
 vasculature demonstrates a mild degree of upper zone redistribution pattern,
 but there is no evidence of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema.  Also,
 the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid
 accumulation.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  Skeletal
 structures grossly within normal limits.  When comparison is made with the
 next preceding chest examination of ___, no new pulmonary
 abnormality.Comparision  suggest that the patient might have been slightly
 more congested with somewhat more prominent perivascular haze in the pulmonary
 circulation as it existed in ___, in comparison with a chest
 examination.
