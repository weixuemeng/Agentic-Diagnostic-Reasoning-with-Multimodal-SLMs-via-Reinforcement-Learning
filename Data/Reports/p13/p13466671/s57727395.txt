                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Poorly-defined peribronchiolar opacities are present in both
 perihilar regions, new since the prior chest radiograph.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are within normal limits and without change.  No pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peribronchiolar opacities in the juxtahilar regions likely
 represent a bronchopneumonia in the setting of recent history of cough. 
 Followup radiographs after completion of antibiotic therapy may be helpful to
 document resolution and to exclude other potential etiologies such as
 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia.
