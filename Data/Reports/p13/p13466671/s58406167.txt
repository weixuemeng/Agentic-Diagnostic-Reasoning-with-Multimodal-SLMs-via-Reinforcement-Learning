                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Lungs are remarkable for a focal area of increased
 opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine posteriorly on the lateral view, a
 finding that is new since older lateral chest x-ray of ___ and
 has a slightly wedge-shaped configuration. This is difficult to localize on
 the PA view but is possibly within the right retrocardiac region, which
 appears more dense than the left side.  Lungs otherwise appear clear, and
 there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Focal basilar lung opacity on lateral chest x-ray, difficult to definitively
 localize on the PA view, but possibly within the right lower lobe.  Although
 the findings are nonspecific, in the setting of pleuritic chest pain,
 pulmonary embolism should be considered as well as a focal infectious
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  
 
 Findings were discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at 2:20 p.m. on ___ (time of discovery 2:05 pm on ___).
