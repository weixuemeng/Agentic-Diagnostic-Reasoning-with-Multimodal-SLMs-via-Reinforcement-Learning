                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure secondary to
 pancreatitis, to evaluate for consolidation, effusion and collapse.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiograph from ___, over 24 hours.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is 3 cm above the carina, right subclavian
 line ends in low SVC/cavoatrial junction, the tip of the feeding tube is in
 the proximal duodenum, single lead from the left pectoral ICD device is
 positioned in right atrium and right internal jugular catheter sheath tip is
 in mid SVC.  Another linear radiopaque structure with its tip ending in the
 lower esophagus, is probably a core temperature monitoring device.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is new since ___.  However, given the low lung
 volumes, the severity of this could be exaggerated.  Mediastinum is little
 wider than it was yesterday and bilateral pulmonary hila are prominent due to
 engorged pulmonary vasculature. Top normal heart size is unchanged. Minimal
 right lung base opacity is either atelectasis or a combination of atelectasis
 and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, newly appeared over last 24 hours.
