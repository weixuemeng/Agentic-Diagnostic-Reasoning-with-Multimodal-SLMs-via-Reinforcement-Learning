                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer, on chemotherapy with cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a new
 right chest wall port with the catheter terminating in the high right atrium. 
 Compared to the prior study, there is marked improvement in pulmonary edema
 and pleural effusions.  The lungs are clear with no areas of focal
 consolidation.  There is hyperinflation with flattening of the diaphragms and
 increased AP diameter consistent with chronic lung disease, with particular
 emphysematous change in the apices.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Mild bilateral apical thickening is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of right chest wall Port-A-Cath.  No
 pneumonia.
