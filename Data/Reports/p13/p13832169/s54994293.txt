                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis and possible cholangitis, worsening
 hypoxia and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with imaging of the lower chest on an
 abdomen CT, ___.
 
 Atelectasis is relatively symmetric at the lung bases.  Mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema is new or more readily apparent on the chest radiograph in the
 abdomen CT.  Left pleural abnormality is thickening not appreciable effusion. 
 Irregular pleural parenchymal thickening at the lung apices is probably
 scarring, although there is greater opacity at the left apex today than it was
 on ___.  This needs to be followed to exclude the development of
 a scar carcinoma or, less likely, reactivation tuberculosis.  Configuration of
 the chest suggests emphysema although no bullae are seen at the bases of the
 lungs on yesterday's abdomen CT.
