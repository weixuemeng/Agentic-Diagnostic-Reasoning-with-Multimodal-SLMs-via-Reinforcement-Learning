                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with worsening cough for three weeks.  Evaluate
 any acute process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Bony callus of a healed fracture of the middle of the left clavicle obscures
 the left lung apex.  Lordotic view is important to exclude the possibility of
 a 10 mm wide irregularly shaped lung nodule obscured by the clavicle.  There
 is slight asymmetry in hilar size, left greater than right.  If there are no
 pulmonary findings, I would not pursue this, since there is no evidence of
 adenopathy elsewhere in the central structures.  Lung otherwise is entirely
 clear, and there is no pleural abnormality.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at the time of dictation. 
 The apical view should be reviewed by a radiologist before the patient leaves
 the department.
