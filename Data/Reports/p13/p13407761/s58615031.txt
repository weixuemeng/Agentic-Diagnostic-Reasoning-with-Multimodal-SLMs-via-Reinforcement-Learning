                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A cluster of calcifications in the right lung apex posteriorly
 appear similar to the prior chest radiograph.  Lungs are otherwise grossly
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces.  Heart size is
 normal, and the aorta is tortuous.  Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia is again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable CT appearance of clustered calcifications at the right
 apex which have been present since a CT neck of ___ and are likely
 the sequela of a previous infectious or inflammatory process in this region.
