  1.  Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities likely represent atelectasis,
  although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
  2.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
  3.  Clustered calcifications at the right lung apex are stable from at least
  ___, likely representing the sequelae of prior infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shorness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, left greater than right.  A linear
 opacity along the mid right lung likely represents fluid within the fissure. 
 Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema is noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from
 prior examination.  Clustered calcifications at the right lung apex appears
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities likely represent atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
 2.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Clustered calcifications at the right lung apex are stable from at least
 ___, possibly representing the sequelae of prior infection.
