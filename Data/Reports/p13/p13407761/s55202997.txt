                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman with nagging persistent dry cough;
 rhonchi on examination with some bibasilar crackles; reevaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral view of the chest shows increased lung volume with
 slight flattening of the diaphragm and mild hyperlucency of the upper lobes,
 compatible with mild emphysematous changes.  A 2 cm rounded dense nodule in
 the right apex is likely a calcified pleural plaque as confirmed by prior CT
 neck.  There are no new nodules or consolidation suspicious for infection or
 malignancy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right apical pleural plaque.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary processes.
