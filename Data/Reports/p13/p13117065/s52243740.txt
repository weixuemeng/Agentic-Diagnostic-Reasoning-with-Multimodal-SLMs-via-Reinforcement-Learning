                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with left apical pneumothorax. 
 Evaluate stability versus enlargement of left pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___ as well as special oblique
 chest views obtained of ___.  Furthermore comparison was
 extended to a chest CT examination of ___.  Position of previously
 described left-sided Port-A-Cath system is unchanged.  Also unchanged
 appearance of the right-sided apical abnormalities apparently related to
 patient's known small cell lung cancer with several cystic lucencies and more
 linear densities surrounding the area.  On chest CT examination of ___, a loculated left-sided pneumothorax was identified without causing any
 signs of tension or mediastinal shift.  The small sized pneumothorax with
 maximal width of 2 cm occupied mostly the anterior pleural space as well as
 the mediastinal space of the pleura.  Thus, the pneumothorax is difficult to
 identify on the standard PA and lateral chest views.  The previously obtained
 oblique views raise the possibility of some pneumothorax extending into the
 left lateral basal pleural area.  Throughout, left-sided lung remained well
 aerated without evidence of acute infiltrates.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion.  When comparison is made directly with the next preceding frontal
 view of the chest examination of ___, the area of suspicious
 extension into the left lateral basal area is less marked, suggesting that the
 pneumothorax is decreasing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Loculated left-sided pneumothorax, mostly occupying mediastinal
 area of pleural space (shown on CT), difficult to identify on routine PA and
 chest examination.  The present examination suggests regression, thus no
 evidence of new abnormalities.  Further followup is recommended related to
 patient's symptomatology.  Continuously well-aerated left lung does not call
 for placement of a chest tube at this time.  Telephone contact with referring
 physician, ___. ___ was established at 3 p.m. and again at 4 p.m.
