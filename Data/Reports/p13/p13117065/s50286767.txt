                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new left upper chest pain for three days and
 a history of small cell lung cancer.  Please assess for spread of cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently a radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  In the right upper lobe, there are several
 sutures and radiopaque clips along with volume loss and opacities, all
 consistent with scarring from prior surgery and radiation therapy.  The left
 lower lobe has a very thin line extending caudally which is difficult to
 discern from a skin fold. Given the patient's history of pain, repeat
 expiratory radiographs are recommended to rule out a pneomothorax. 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax, although again noted are severe emphysematous changes with
 hyperinflation of the lungs.  No new focal consolidation is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Small possibility of pneumothorax of the left lung. Given the patient's
 clinically complaint, repeat expiratory and oblique views should be obtained
 to better evaluate this. 
 2) Post-radiation and surgical treatment changes in the right upper lobe.
 
 Discussed with ___ at 14:18 by ___ via telephone, 2 minutes
 after the initial discovery of the findings.
