                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Streaky opacity within the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis, and no focal consolidation is present.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical
 anchors are demonstrated overlying the left humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  Infection however is not
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
