                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough post-op r/o PNA  // ? PNA atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly increased elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as compared to the
 most recent CT scan, could be due to true elevation or a subpulmonic effusion.
 Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. A
 nodular density projecting over the periphery of the left mid lung was present
 on the prior radiograph of ___, but does not have a correlate on the
 CT from ___ and may represent a high nipple shadow or something
 external to the patient.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion.  Apparent worsened elevation of right
 hemidiaphragm could potentially reflect a subpulmonic component of the right
 effusion.  Consider a right lateral decubitus CXR for further evaluation.
