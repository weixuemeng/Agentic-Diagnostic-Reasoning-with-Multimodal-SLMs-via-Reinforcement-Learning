                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia and pneumonia, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  Since yesterday, small pleural effusions
 have moderately increased in extent to now occupy the lower third of both
 hemithoraces.  As a consequence, there are areas of atelectasis at both lung
 bases that are slightly more extensive than on the previous image.  Unchanged
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of pneumonia.
