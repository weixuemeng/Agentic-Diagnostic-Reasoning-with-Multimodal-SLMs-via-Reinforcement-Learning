                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of congestive heart failure on Lasix.  Postoperative
 tachycardia.  Evaluate fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, with
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  The cardiac contour is within
 normal limits.  The apparent upper zone redistribution may be a function of
 low lung volumes. Left basilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusions are
 identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Right chest wall catheter tip
 terminates in the proximal cavoatrial junction.  Again noted are multilevel
 spinal stabilization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of fluid status due to low lung volumes
 accentuating the pulmonary vasculature.  No pleural effusions.
