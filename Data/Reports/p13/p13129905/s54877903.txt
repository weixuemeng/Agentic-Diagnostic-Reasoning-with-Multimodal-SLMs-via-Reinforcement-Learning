                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Both lungs demonstrate low lung volumes with
 crowding of bronchovascular markings, but no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart silhouette is inadequately evaluated and
 appears likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  A prominent gastric bubble is
 noted below the left diaphragm.
