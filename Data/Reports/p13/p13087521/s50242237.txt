 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, fever, SOB  // r/o pneumonia     
 r/o pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 2 round, cm size radio opacities project over the right lung and anterior
 fifth rib.  One is the right nipple, and the other could be a calcification in
 the costal cartilage.  I would recommend shallow oblique views with nipple
 markers to exclude a lung nodule, even though no corresponding abnormality is
 seen on the lateral view.
 
 Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Shallow oblique views with nipple markers.  These Should
 be shown to radiologist before the patient leaves the radiology department.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 11:32 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
