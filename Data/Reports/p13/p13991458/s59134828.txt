 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right tunneled dialysis catheter has been placed in the interim with its tip
 in the right atrium.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion and edema is mild.
 Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, worse on the left, is
 consistent with a small left and trace right pleural effusion.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest focal pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged, overall unchanged.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Lung
 volumes have improved since the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild edema and small-to-trace bilateral pleural effusions.
