                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, chest pain, dyspnea, question infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 There is patchy opacity with air bronchograms at both lung bases, consistent
 with a pneumonic infiltrate.  The differential diagnosis could include
 aspiration, but this is considered less likely.  There do appear to be
 background increased interstitial markings which could be related to either
 acute or chronic lung disease.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly
 prominent, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated.  Mild prominence of the azygos vein is likely also
 accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for bilateral pneumonic infiltrates.  Also
 diffusely increased interstitial markings, which may indicate a background
 acute or chronic process.
