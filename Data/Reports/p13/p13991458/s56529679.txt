                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On chest CT ___, bilateral consolidation and
 ground-glass opacities were mostly compatible with pneumonia.  Severe
 widespread ground glass opacities and consolidations progressed on latest
 chest x-ray done today at 3:12 p.m.
 
 This chest x-ray was done two hours after the most recent prior and there is
 improvement of bilateral opacities.  Considering the rapid evolution of these
 opacities, pulmonary edema is the most likely diagnosis.  The residual
 pulmonary edema is moderate.  Bibasilar consolidations as shown on CT are
 compatible with pneumonia.  ET tube ends 5 cm above carina.  NG tube is in the
 stomach.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and
 cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 1.  Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation shown on prior CT is compatible with
 pneumonia.
 2.  Rapid improvement of diffuse bilateral ground-glass and alveolar opacities
 is compatible with concurrent pulmonary edema.
