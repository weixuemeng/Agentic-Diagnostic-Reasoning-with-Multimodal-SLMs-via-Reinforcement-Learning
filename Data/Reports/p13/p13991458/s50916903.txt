                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with flash pulmonary edema, now intubated.  Evaluation
 for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The patient was extubated since prior exam and the NG tube had been removed. 
 After the extubation the lung volumes look lower with more proeminence of
 pulmonary vessel, heart and azygous vein.  The patient is treated with
 pneumonia and bilateral opacities are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The patient has been extubated since prior exam, this causes lower lung
 volumes with increased volume load.
