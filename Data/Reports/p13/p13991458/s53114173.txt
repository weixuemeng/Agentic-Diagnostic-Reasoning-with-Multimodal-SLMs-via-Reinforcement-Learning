                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Severe respiratory distress.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same evening.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  This study
 suggests there may be at least trace pleural effusions.  Parenchymal opacities
 have increased.  Although these are somewhat more conspicuous in the right
 lower lung than elsewhere, likely etiology is pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening parenchymal opacities suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  Although
 less likely developing pneumonia at the right lung base is not excluded.
