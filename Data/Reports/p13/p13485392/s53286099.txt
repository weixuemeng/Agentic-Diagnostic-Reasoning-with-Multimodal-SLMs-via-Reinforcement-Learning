                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with severe PVD s/p stenting and bypass in the past, HTN,
 DM2, HLD, CKD III, ILD with emphysema and bronchiectasis since ___, presented
 to ___ on ___ for shortness of breath for ___ days, who was
 diagnosed with H. Flu pneumonia and transferred to the ___ ICU for hypoxemic
 respiratory failure. // ET tube placement i/s/o air leak
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___, widespread airspace opacities have not
 significantly changed.  Background emphysema, bronchiectasis and fibrosis,
 causing significant interstitial abnormality on the chest radiograph.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The ETT is 5 cm from the carina. The
 remaining support devices are in good position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread airspace opacities superimposed on chronic fibrotic interstitial
 lung disease have not significantly changed.  Although widespread infection is
 in the differential, rapid progression of interstitial lung disease could also
 be considered.
