                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man organ donor  // eval for changes every 24 hours
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT scan of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over
 the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the
 mid thoracic trachea.  The feeding tube extends below the level the diaphragms
 but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 Increasing hazy opacity at the left lung base with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm may reflect a layering pleural effusion with subjacent
 atelectasis.  The appearance of the right lung is unchanged.  No pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left layering pleural effusion with subjacent atelectasis. 
 Otherwise no interval change.
