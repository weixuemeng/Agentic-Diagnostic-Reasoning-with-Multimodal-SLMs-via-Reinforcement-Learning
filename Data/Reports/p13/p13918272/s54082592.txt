                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p polytrauma now s/p right IJ CVL placement  // eval CVL
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, the
 tip projects over the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
 projects over the mid thoracic trachea.  A gastric tube extends below the
 level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 The small right pneumothorax and a parenchymal contusions seen on the prior CT
 chest are not evident radiographically.  The known rib and sternal fractures
 were better evaluated on the earlier cross-sectional imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over
 the cavoatrial junction.  An enteric feeding tube extends below the level the
 diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 The known parenchymal contusions and small right pneumothorax as well as the
 rib and sternal fractures were better evaluated on the CT chest from earlier
 today.
