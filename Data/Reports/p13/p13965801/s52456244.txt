                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers with history of sarcoidosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy opacities in the right lower lung with corresponding linear
 opacities projecting over the lower thoracic spine are likely secondary to
 subsegmental atelectasis, although an infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right lower lung opacities, likely atelectasis, although
 an infectious process cannot be excluded.
