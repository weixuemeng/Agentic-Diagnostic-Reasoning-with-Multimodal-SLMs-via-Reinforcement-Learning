                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Multifocal lung
 opacities have substantially improved with residual faint ground-glass
 opacities remaining, affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the
 left.  Some of these have a round or nodular configuration as demonstrated on
 prior CT.  Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal region is
 evidenced by fullness in the infrahilar region on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Markedly improving multifocal lung opacities.  Although nonspecific, if
 the patient received recent antibiotic therapy, this may reflect a resolving
 infection.
