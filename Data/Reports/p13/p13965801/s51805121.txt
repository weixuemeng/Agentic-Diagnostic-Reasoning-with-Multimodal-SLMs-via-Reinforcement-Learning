                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes and patient body habitus.
 The pulmonary vascular markings are exaggerated by low lung volumes but there
 is suggestion of pulmonary arterial prominence in comparison to the prior
 study.  There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes.  Otherwise, the lungs
 are without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.  No acute fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient body habitus demonstrates
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. However, a repeat radiograph
 would be helpful in further evaluation of the lower lobes. 
 2. Pulmonary arteries appear slightly prominent and raise suspicion for early
 heart failure.
