                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with history of sarcoidosis and
 immunosuppressive treatment, who arrives with upper respiratory infection
 symptoms, worse shortness of breath and fevers to 100.8 for one week.  Assess
 for possible pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with several previous chest examinations
 (___, ___ and ___).  Presently, the heart
 size is normal.  No configurational abnormality is present.  Thoracic aorta
 and mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  Appearance of central pulmonary structures has not undergone any
 interval change in this patient with clinical history of sarcoidosis.  When
 comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___, at that time identified linear opacities on the lung bases suggestive of
 peripheral atelectasis cannot be identified anymore.  No evidence of new
 infiltrates is presently found and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 are free.  Review of the chest examination of ___, identify
 multiple bilateral, but mostly right-sided patchy infiltrates which on
 simultaneously performed chest CT demonstrated multiple peribronchial and
 perivascular ground-glass densities.  These changes had regressed markedly on
 examination of ___.  On the present chest examination, no
 reoccurrence of such infiltrates can be observed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates indicating acute
 pneumonia.  Observed that the patient is very adipos, a factor, which reduces
 to some degree the ability of identifying hazy ground-glass densities.
