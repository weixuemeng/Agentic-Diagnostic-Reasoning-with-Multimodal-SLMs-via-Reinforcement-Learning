                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient before surgery assessment
 for tuberculosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There are linear opacities in both
 upper lobes with mild volume loss, concerning for scarring and potentially may
 be related to prior granulomatous exposure.
 
 No definitive evidence of active tuberculosis seen.  Comparison with prior
 studies is beneficial or potentially further assessment with chest CT.
