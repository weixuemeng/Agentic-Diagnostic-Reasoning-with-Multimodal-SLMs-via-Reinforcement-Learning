                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion. 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is detected.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Incidental note is made that the left clavicular
 companion shadow is not distinctly visualized.Osseous structures are grossly
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Chest x-ray examination within normal limits.  No focal or diffuse
 infiltrate to suggest pneumonia.  
 2) Incidental note is made that the left clavicular companion shadow is not
 distinctly visualized.  While this could be an artifact of positioning,
 clinical correlation to assess for any supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is
 requested.
