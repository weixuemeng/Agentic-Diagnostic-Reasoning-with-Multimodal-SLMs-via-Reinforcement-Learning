                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after motor vehicle
 collision, for evaluation of the progression of pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP radiograph was compared to multiple prior studies obtained the
 date earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is currently 7.2 cm above the carina.  The left chest tube is
 in place with no appreciable pneumothorax currently seen.  Multiple rib
 fractures are redemonstrated, both left and right.  The known fracture of the
 right scapula can be partially assessed on the current radiograph.  The
 increased opacity of the right lung is demonstrated and might suggest 
 interval development of layering pleural effusion in the presence of multiple
 rib fractures.  There is also small loculated lucency projecting over the
 mid-lower portion of the right lung and might reflect loculated pneumothorax
 in this location, not clearly seen on the original radiographs but
 corresponding to the small amount of pneumothorax seen on the prior CT torso
 and might potentially reflect its increase in size.
