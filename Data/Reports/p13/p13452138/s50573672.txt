                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fevers, DOE, new productive cough
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattened diaphragms suggesting COPD.  There is asymmetric prominence of the
 left pulmonary hilum on the frontal view which correlates to a posterior
 opacity on the lateral view.  Findings are most compatible with pneumonia in
 the superior segment of the left lower lobe.  No large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most suggestive of pneumonia in the superior segment of the left
 lower lobe.  However, would recommend followup to resolution to exclude
 underlying malignant process.
