                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ORIF of the left leg and right arm with rising white
 blood cell count. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the enteric tube has been pulled back. The tip is still
 in the stomach, though the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction. A
 left PICC is in unchanged position with the tip in the upper-to-mid SVC.
 Pulmonary edema has resolved. There is no opacity to suggest pneumonia. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette size
 is at the upper limits of normal, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. The tip of the enteric tube is in the stomach, though the side port is
 above the gastroesophageal junction. Recommend advancing 7-8 cm.
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically, no evidence of pneumonia.
