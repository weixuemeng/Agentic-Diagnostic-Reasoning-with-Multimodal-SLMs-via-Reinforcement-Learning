                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation + bronch  // check tube position
 check tube position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. 
 Apparent nasogastric tube extends to the upper body of the stomach, where an
 opaque tip coils back on itself. Nevertheless, the tip lies within the
 stomach.  The patient has taken a better inspiration, which may have resulted
 in an some apparent improvement in pulmonary congestion. More focal area of
 increased opacification in the right upper zone is worrisome for pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical situation.
