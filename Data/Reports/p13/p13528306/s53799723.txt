                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with blunt force abdominal thoracic trauma.
 Very edematous and erythematous tissue on ___ bronchoscopy.  // ? worsening
 pulmonary contustions     ? worsening pulmonary contustions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___. Read in
 conjunction with chest CT ___ at 19:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has progressed substantially and
 asymmetrically since ___.  The changes between ___
 suggest pulmonary edema. Subsequently much more consolidation has developed in
 the right lung apex and perihilar left lung.  I would attribute that pulmonary
 contusion and hemorrhage only if the patient has developed a bleeding
 diathesis, because there was little if any contusion on the initial chest CT
 ___. For example if the patient is thrombocytopenic from multiple
 transfusions, minimal early contusions can bleed more heavily after an initial
 delay.  I would suggest instead bilateral pneumonia in the setting of
 continued pulmonary edema.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions increased
 since ___, are stable since ___.  The heart is only mildly
 enlarged but mediastinal veins are still dilated.
 
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the region of the

 origin of the SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
