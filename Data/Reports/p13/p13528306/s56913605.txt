 // eval R lung opacification      eval R lung opacification
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric
 tubes have been removed.  The focal opacification in the right upper zone has
 decreased, consistent with slow clearing of pulmonary contusion.  There is
 again poor definition of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Mild atelectatic changes with small effusions are
 probably present at the bases.
