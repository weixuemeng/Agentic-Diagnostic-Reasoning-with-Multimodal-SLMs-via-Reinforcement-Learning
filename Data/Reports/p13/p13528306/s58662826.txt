                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with polytrauma, rib fractures. Intubated. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph and semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina in
 unchanged position.  A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the
 upper SVC. There is persistent moderate pulmonary edema with a new right mid
 lung opacity. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  New opacity in the right lung may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema
 versus a developing consolidation. Pulmonary contusion is felt to be less
 likely. Close clinical followup is recommended.
