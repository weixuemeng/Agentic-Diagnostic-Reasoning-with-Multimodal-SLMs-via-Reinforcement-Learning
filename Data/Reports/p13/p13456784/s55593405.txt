                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with STEMI  // Assess for interval changes and
 line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest portable ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump.  The
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back and currently resides in the region of
 the tricuspid valve.  The NG tube resides in the stomach.  The ET tube is
 appropriately positioned 2 cm above the carina.  Moderate cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Mediastinal widening is secondary to
 right-sided heart failure.  Pleural effusions persist.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed.
 2.  Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube, and ET tube are in appropriate position.
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion persist.
 4.  Mediastinal widening is probably secondary to right-sided heart failure.
