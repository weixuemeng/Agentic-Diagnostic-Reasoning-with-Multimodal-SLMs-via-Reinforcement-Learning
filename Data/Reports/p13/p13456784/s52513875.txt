 A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  The trachea is central.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly with prominence
 of the bilateral hila and haziness of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally, overall the appearances
 are consistent with pulmonary edema.  This appears slightly worse than on the
 prior study.  No pleural effusion appreciated.  No pneumothorax seen.
