                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with NSTEMI, flash pulm edema, VT ablation  //
 interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.  Allowing for
 lordotic positioning.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar to the prior
 study.  There is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with
 interstitial edema.  Allowing for technical differences, this is not
 definitely changed.  There is worsened retrocardiac density, now with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  The possibility of a small left
 effusion cannot be excluded.  Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base,
 consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  A small right effusion is also
 again noted.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. CHF, with interstitial edema.  Allowing for technical differences, the
 overall appearance is similar to ___, possibly very slightly
 improved.
 2. Worsening opacification at the left lung base, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possible small left effusion.
 3. Small right effusion, with atelectasis at the right base.  The right base
 atelectasis is very slightly improved.  The possibility of an early infectious
 infiltrate at the right lung base is considered less likely, but cannot be
 entirely excluded.
