 There has been interval placement of a right-sided PICC, this terminates in
 the right atrium and could be withdrawn 3-4 cm for better seating within the
 SVC.  Lung volumes are low but improved compared to the prior study.  Apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is less prominent than on the prior study.  No
