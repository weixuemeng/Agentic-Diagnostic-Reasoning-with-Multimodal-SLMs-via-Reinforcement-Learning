                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ is a ___ M with h/o dCHF (EF >___%), HTN, CAD, Afib
 (on Apixaban), hx of lung CA with two recent hospitalizations for pneumonia
 and acute exacerbation of heart failure, with findings of ?cavitary lesion on
 L lung  // better characterize the equivocal ?cavitary lesion of l lung   
 better characterize the equivocal ?cavitary lesion of l lung
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is an area of
 opacification in the left mid zone with apparent cavitation, which CT could
 show to better advantage if clinically warranted.  Extensive opacification at
 the left base is consistent with pleural fluid, some of which may be
 loculated.  Extensive opacification at the right base is consistent with
 pleural fluid with underlying volume loss in the right lower and middle lobes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   CT would be of value if further assessment of the various
 abnormalities is clinically warranted.
