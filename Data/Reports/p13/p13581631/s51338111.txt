                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and more recent
 chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  A right-sided pleural effusion, with
 associated areas of persistent atelectasis, appears mostly unchanged, although
 there is greater fissural thickening, suggesting increasing or shifting fluid
 content.  There is no definite pleural effusion on the left.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A new mild central interstitial abnormality about each hilum is
 suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Predominantly central interstitial abnormality, suggestive of
 mild vascular congestion.
