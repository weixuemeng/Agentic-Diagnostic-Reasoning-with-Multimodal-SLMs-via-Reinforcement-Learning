  Compared to the prior radiograph, persistent cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural
  effusions, and new diffuse increased interstitial lung markings are suggestive
  of pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Inter study
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hx renal dz/CHF with dyspnea "which feels like
 my CHF".  Pneumonia/pulmonary edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, there are new diffuse increased interstitial
 lung markings, with persistent bilateral pleural effusions, previously
 described as possibly loculated in the left lung.  Patient is post right lower
 lobectomy.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Previously reported areas of
 consolidation are similar including a dominant perihilar region with apparent
 cavitation, the latter better seen on the prior study.  .  Anchors overlying
 the right humeral head are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, interstitial edema is present, superimposed
 upon previous findings attributed to multifocal pneumonia with possible area
 of cavitation in the left mid lung.  Apparent slight increase in size of
 moderate right pleural effusion, and persistent small left pleural effusion.
