  1.   Multifocal airspace opacities are most consistent with a multifocal
  infectious process.
  
  2.  A vague area of lucency within the left mid lung is equivocal for a
  cavitary lesion.  Repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs could be performed
  for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hyperk  // eval for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. 
 Multifocal airspace opacities are present.  A vague area of lucency within the
 left mid lung is equivocal for a cavitary lesion.   Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small.  The heart is enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Multifocal airspace opacities are most consistent with a multifocal
 infectious process.
 
 2.  A vague area of lucency within the left mid lung is equivocal for a
 cavitary lesion.  Repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs could be performed
 for further evaluation, with further characterization by CT confirmed
 radiographically.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  A vague area of lucency within the left mid lung is
 equivocal for a cavitary lesion.  Repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs
 could be performed for further evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated impression and recommendations were discussed with Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at 08:14 on ___, approximately ___ min
 after discovery.
