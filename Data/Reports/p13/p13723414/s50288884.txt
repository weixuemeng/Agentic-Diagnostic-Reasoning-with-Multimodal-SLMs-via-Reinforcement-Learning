                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension, shortness of breath, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Chain sutures are again seen within the
 right upper lobe. Extensive metastatic disease is again noted with widening of
 the superior mediastinum, right hilar lymphadenopathy, extensive nodular
 deposits and irregular thickening along the pleura bilaterally,  and
 innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules.  A right upper lobe dominant mass
 appears unchanged. The lungs remain hyperinflated compatible with COPD. A
 trace left pleural effusion is likely present. Compared to the most recent
 previous radiograph, there is increased opacification within the right upper
 lobe which could reflect infection in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Known osseous metastatic
 disease is better visualized on the recent chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification within the right upper lobe may reflect infection in
 the correct clinical setting.Extensive metastatic disease throughout the
 thorax is otherwise grossly unchanged.
