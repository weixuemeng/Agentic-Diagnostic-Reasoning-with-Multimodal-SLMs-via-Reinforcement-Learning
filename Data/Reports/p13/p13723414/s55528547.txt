                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p VATS RUL wedge  // R/O PTX post CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of right-sided chest tube.  There appears to
 be a small right apical pneumothorax, measuring less than 1 cm, unchanged
 since prior study.  Surgical suture chains are seen at the right apex,
 consistent with the recent video-assisted for thoracic surgery.
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear grossly unchanged.  No definite
 pulmonary consolidative process is seen.  There does appear to be some pleural
 thickening along the left chest wall, possibly due to loculated fluid as seen
 on prior CT imaging.
 
 There is a large amount of right-sided subcutaneous gas, consistent with prior
 VATS.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of right-sided chest tube.  Small right apical pneumothorax,
 unchanged.
