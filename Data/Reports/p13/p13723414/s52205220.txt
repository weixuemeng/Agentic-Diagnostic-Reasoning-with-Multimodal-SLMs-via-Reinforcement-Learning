                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma, new upper back pain,
 SOB, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation limited due to multiple overlying wires and overlying device.
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest was provided. There is apparent
 increased opacity in the right upper lung which could reflect pneumonia. 
 Suture material projecting over the right upper lung again noted.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle is chronic. Chain suture material projects over
 the right upper lung. The heart is not enlarged.  Mediastinal contour appears
 grossly stable though right margin is difficult to accurately assess. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the right upper lung could represent pneumonia. Consider
 repeat with more optimized technique to better assess.
