                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of left pleural catheter, with interval decrease
 in size of loculated left pleural effusion with known associated pleural
 thickening consistent with history of mesothelioma.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Improved opacities in left lower lobe and lingula
 adjacent to pleural effusion, most likely due to atelectasis.  Peripheral
 poorly defined right upper lobe nodule appears similar to the prior radiograph
 and has been more fully assessed by CT of the chest on ___.  It
 measures approximately 1.8 cm and has irregular margins.
 
 Mild scoliosis is again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right apical lung nodule is suspicious for primary lung malignancy.
 
 2.  Decreased left pleural effusion with residual loculated fluid and pleural
 thickening in left hemithorax consistent with history of mesothelioma.  
 
 3.  Improving atelectasis in lingula and left lower lobe and lingula.
