                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of effusion, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an almost
 unchanged amount of left pleural effusion.  The effusion is small and limited
 to the lower portions of the left costophrenic sinus.  The effusion is better
 appreciated on the lateral than on the frontal view.  Potentially, the
 effusion is related to a an area of pleural thickening, adjacent to an old rib
 fracture, also on the left, that has slightly increased in size.
 
 A pre-existing minimal opacity at the right lung apex, projecting over the
 posterior portions of the second and third rib, is completely unchanged.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
