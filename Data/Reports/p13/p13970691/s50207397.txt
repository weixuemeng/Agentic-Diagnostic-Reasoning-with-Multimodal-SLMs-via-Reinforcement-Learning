                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with schizophrenia, hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given
 this, there appears to be mild central vascular pulmonary engorgement.  Soft
 tissue overlying the lung base likely causes underpenetration.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No definite focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.
