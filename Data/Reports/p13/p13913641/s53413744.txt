 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with sepsis.  Check ET tube and OG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The lung volumes have improved following intubation, there is greater
 consolidation at both lung bases medially.  Whether this is pneumonia or
 atelectasis due to retained secretions is radiographically indeterminate. 
 Upper lobe vasculature is mildly engorged, but this is not a pattern of
 pulmonary edema.  Heart size is normal.  At least small bilateral pleural
 effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
