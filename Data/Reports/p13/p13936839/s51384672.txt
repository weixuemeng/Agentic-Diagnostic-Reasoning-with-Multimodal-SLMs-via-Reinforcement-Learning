                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with multi trauma from fall, hypoxia.  Eval for trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph of earlier on the same date. 
 CT abdomen pelvis of the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An apparent opacity overlying the left hemi thorax is due to a large hiatal
 hernia identified on the CT abdomen pelvis of the same date.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is mild.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Evaluation of the chest cage after
 trauma is not optimal on CT, but there are no apparent osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Suboptimal evaluation of the chest cage after trauma.  However, within
 this limitation, no apparent osseous abnormalities.
 
 2.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Please refer to the dedicated CT abdomen and pelvis report of the same
 date for further findings.
