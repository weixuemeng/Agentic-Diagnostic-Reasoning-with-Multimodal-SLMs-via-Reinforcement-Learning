                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post fall with chest pain  // ?rib fracture,
 pneumonia, cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve replacement. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contours are similar. 
 Crowding of bronchovascular structures is due to low lung volumes.  Patchy
 atelectasis is also noted without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
 spine.  No displaced fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly without congestive heart failure.
 2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.

 rib fracture, consider a dedicated rib series
