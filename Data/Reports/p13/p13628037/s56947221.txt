                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:43 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new hypoxia.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascularity is mildly engorged in the upper lobes and mediastinal
 veins are borderline dilated.  I do not see pulmonary edema, but this might be
 very early stage of cardiac decompensation.  There are no focal findings to
 suggest pneumonia and no pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
