                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  New hypoxemia, evaluation for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there are subtle bilateral
 parenchymal opacities at both lung bases.  Although the asymmetry of the
 changes could suggest atelectasis, early pneumonia must be considered as a
 differential diagnosis in this neutropenic patient.  Mild fluid overload. 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position of the  CVAL.
