                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Distant heart sounds. Pulmonary
 congestion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided dialysis catheter is again seen, with the tip in the region of the
 cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, which is
 accentuated by the portable technique.  There is increased retrocardiac
 opacity seen at the left base, which is likely related in large part to
 atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or consolidation.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Osseous structures appear grossly unremarkable, aside from degenerative
 changes at the glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity which may be related to atelectasis.  No definite
 pulmonary edema.
