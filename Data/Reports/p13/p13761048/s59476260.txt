                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 tortuosity of the aorta and prominence of interstitial markings consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.  Poor
 definition of the left heart border is essentially unchanged.  Although this
 could represent a lingular consolidation, this is not definitely supported on
 the sub-optimal lateral view.
