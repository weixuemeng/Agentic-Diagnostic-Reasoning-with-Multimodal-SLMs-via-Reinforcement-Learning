                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lethargy  // Eval for infectious process,
 volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, newly
 placed in the interval. The heart remains moderately enlarged. Low lung
 volumes are present which cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures.
 There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema
 is identified. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Assessment of the lung apices
 is obscured due to the patient's neck soft tissues projecting over these
 regions. Again demonstrated, however, is opacification within the left apex
 corresponding to the known mass in this location. The known right lower lobe
 pulmonary nodule is not as well assessed on the current exam. Streaky
 atelectasis is demonstrated in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or
 large pneumothorax is identified. Pneumoperitoneum is new in the interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New pneumoperitoneum.
 2. Low lung volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures with
 possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No overt pulmonary edema.
 3. Re- demonstration of left apical mass, though assessment is limited. Known
 right lower lobe nodule is not well visualized on the current exam.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings regarding pneumoperitoneum were discussed by Dr.
 ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 5:50 PM..
