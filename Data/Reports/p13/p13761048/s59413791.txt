 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with low-grade temperature.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Compared to prior, there has been no significant
 interval change.  Again seen is prominence of interstitial markings,
 potentially due to pulmonary vascular congestion or chronic underlying
 disease.  There is no evidence of new consolidation, patient's arms are by her
 side on the lateral exam somewhat limiting this view.  Cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, but stable.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior.
