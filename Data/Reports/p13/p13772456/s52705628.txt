                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea, fever, cough. Evaluate for
 evidence of infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings, and there is no
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes may accentuate mild the interstitial edema. Recommend repeat
 chest radiograph with improved inspiration for further evaluation.
