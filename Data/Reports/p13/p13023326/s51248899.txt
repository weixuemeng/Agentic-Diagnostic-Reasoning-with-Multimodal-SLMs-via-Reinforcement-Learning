 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___, at 17:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent bilateral layering pleural effusions.
 A right lateral pleural thickening which may represent fluid or possibly
 involvement to the patient's known metastatic melanoma.  Right hilar mass
 obscures the cardiac and mediastinal contours and limits evaluation of the
 right mid and lower lung.  Right peripheral mid lung opacity most likely
 represents fluid loculated within the horizontal fissure.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity at the left base most likely represents
 compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
