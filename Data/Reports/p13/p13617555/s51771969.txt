                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough and fever with pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a focal consolidation projecting over
 the left lung within the lingula.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There
 is a suspected trace pleural effusion on the left only.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity suggesting pneumonia in the lingula.  Follow-up
 radiographs are recommended within eight weeks in order to ensure resolution.
