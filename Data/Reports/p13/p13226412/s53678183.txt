                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Borderline cardiomegaly is noted. Both lungs
 are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Minimally low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular
 markings.  Rightward tracheal displacement with apparent left-sided mass
 effect is most compatible with a thyroid nodule.
