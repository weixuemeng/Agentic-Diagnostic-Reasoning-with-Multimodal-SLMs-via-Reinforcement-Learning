                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  The patient is status post thrombotic right MCA stroke, evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 Dobbhoff catheter courses through the mediastinum to terminate in the region
 of the stomach, although the exact tip is not seen.
 
 Increased bronchial markings in both lung bases, particularly on the right
 side are unchanged.  There is worsening left retrocardiac opacity, now with
 silhouetting of the entire left hemidiaphragm.  This perhaps is most typical
 of atelectasis, although the typical wedge shape is not appreciated.  No
 significant size pleural effusion.  I am uncertain as to how much of the
 appearance in the left base represents projectional finding.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 New opacification of the left retrocardiac area, presumptively representing
 atelectasis, although the appearances are little unusual for this.  No
 additional findings of note.
