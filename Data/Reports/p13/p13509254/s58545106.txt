                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post hip ORIF with subsequent wide complex
 tachycardia, respiratory distress, requiring intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable frontal chest radiographs were obtained.  An
 endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating at the mid
 clavicular heads.  Fullness and irregularity of the bilateral hila,
 aorticopulmonary window and azygos contour is accentuated by the low lung
 volumes.  Linear horizontal atelectasis is noted at the right base.  No
 effusion, pneumothorax or new consolidation is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate position of ETT tube.
 2.  Persistent mediastinal and hilar contour abnormalities represent
 multifocal lymphadenopathy or vascular enlargement.  A chest radiograph can
 neither confirm nor exclude a pulmonary embolism.  A chest CTA is still
 required to better assess the mediastinum.
