                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.  Upper sternal wires are fractured
 and new plating from both sides of what looks like sternal dehiscence.
 
 There are low lung volumes, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular crowding.  Even allowing for this, there is at least moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Diffuse bilateral opacities consistent with mild pulmonary
 edema.  No focal consolidation or appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema, exaggerated by low lung
 volumes.
