                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath and leg edema.  Evaluate for
 evidence of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT torso on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for some bronchovascular
 crowding.  Allowing for these limitations, there is a patchy opacity in the
 left lower lung field which partially obscures the left heart border.  No
 other focal opacities are present.  Previously noted right apical and upper
 lobe opacities in the CT torso are not clearly seen in this exam.  Cardiac
 size appears mildly enlarged although cannot be properly assessed due to
 obscuration of the left heart border.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung pneumonia.
