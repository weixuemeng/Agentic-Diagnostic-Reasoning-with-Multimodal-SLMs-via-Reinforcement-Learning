                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, question pneumonia in a patient with
 pancreatic cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The left lower lobe opacity seen on the
 recent prior study persists and is consistent with pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting.  However, there is mild increase in interstitial markings
 without alveolar opacities, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia. 
 New mild pulmonary edema.
