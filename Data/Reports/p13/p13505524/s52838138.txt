                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bibasilar crackles, to assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence
 of the pulmonary vascularity that is also somewhat indistinct, which one
 associated with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is consistent with
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  However, there also is poor definition of the
 hemidiaphragms, which could reflect pleural effusion with compressive
 atelectasis.
 
 The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
