                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:14 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Neutropenia and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater caliber to mediastinal veins, hila, and lung vessels suggest volume
 overload, but I do not see pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Chest CT scanning is
 much more sensitive in detecting early infection.  Heart size normal.  No
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Right subclavian line ends in
 the mid SVC.
