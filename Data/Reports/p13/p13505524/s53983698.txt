                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right IJ line with tip in the distal SVC is again seen.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular re-distribution,
 slightly more prominent than on prior study.  There is a small left effusion
 and some volume loss in both lower lungs but no definite infiltrate.  The
 overall impression is that of worsened fluid status.  Given neutropenia, an
 underlying infection cannot be totally excluded.
