                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures.
 Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis, however, pneumonia could be
 considered in the correct clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is unchanged. Heart is mildly
 enlarged but unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis with low lung volumes, however,
 pneumonia could be considered in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
