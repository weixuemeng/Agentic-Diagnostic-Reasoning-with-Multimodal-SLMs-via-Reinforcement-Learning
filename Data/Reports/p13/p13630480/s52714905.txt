                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // eval for abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left retrocardiac opacity likely represents a small hiatal hernia with
 adjacent compression atelectasis.  Linear atelectasis is noted at the
 peripheral left lung base.  The upper lungs are grossly clear.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. 
 Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable in appearance.  There is no evidence of free subdiaphragmatic
 air.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left retrocardiac opacity likely represents a small hiatal hernia with
 adjacent atelectasis.  However, superimposed infection is difficult to exclude
 completely.
