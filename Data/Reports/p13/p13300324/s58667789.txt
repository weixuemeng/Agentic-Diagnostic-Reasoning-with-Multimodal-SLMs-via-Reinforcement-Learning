                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day portable radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate that the lungs are
 slightly hyperinflated and there is bibasilar scarring, but otherwise they are
 clear of focal opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Surgical clip is noted in
 the right upper lobe, perhaps from a prior surgical resection.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  The mediastinum is normal in its size.  Once
 again, there is lucency under the left hemidiaphragm which persists on the
 lateral view and is most likely due to a portion of colon.  Although, if the
 patient's clinical exam dictates, a left lateral decubitus film would be
 helpful to definitively rule out free air.  Minimal wedging of the mid
 thoracic vertebral bodies and a kyphosis is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with lucency underneath is most likely
 due to a portion of colon.  Although, if patient's abdominal exam dictates and
 free air is of concern, a left lateral decubitus film would be helpful to
 fully evaluate free air.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ at 10:45 a.m. via telephone.
