                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bibasilar and right mid lung opacities are seen.   There is minimal
 biapical scarring as well.  Given the patient's rotation, the mediastinum
 appears to be within normal limits.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  2.1
 mm rounded structure in the right hilus may be a partially calcified lymph
 node.  There is no large pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
 
 A lucency under the left hemidiaphragm is most likely colon or the gastric
 bubble.  Free air cannot be ruled out.  If there is concern for the patient's
 abdominal exam, a lateral decubitus film would be helpful.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.   Basilar and right midlung opacities, potentially atelectasis but clinical
 correlation suggested.  No obvious evidence of cardiopulmonary process. 
 2.  Lucency under the left hemidiaphragm, most likely gastric bubble or colon,
 however, if there is concern for abdominal process, free air cannot be ruled
 out.  A left lateral decubitus film would be helpful in evaluating.
 
 ___ at pager ___ was paged at 9:46 a.m. to discuss the
 findings.
