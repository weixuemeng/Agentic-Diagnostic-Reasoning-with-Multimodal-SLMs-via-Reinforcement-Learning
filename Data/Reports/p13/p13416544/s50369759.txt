 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation.  Plate-like opacity at
 the right base is most consistent with atelectasis.  No definite focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema is present.  The heart size is top
 normal.  There is tortuosity of the aorta with dense atherosclerotic
 calcification.  There is compression deformity of mid-thoracic vertebral
 bodies.
