                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough with recent abdominal CT revealing a "mass-like
 consolidation" in the right lung.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As seen on the prior CT from ___, there is a mass-like
 opacity within the right middle lobe, measuring 3.9 x 2.9 cm, not
 significantly changed in size, allowing for differences in modality.  This
 opacity is new compared to the most recent prior chest radiograph from ___.  Of note, this lesion demonstrated central hypoenhancement on the
 recent CT from ___, suggestive of necrotic mass or abscess.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in 3.9 cm mass or abscess in the right
 middle lobe, seen on CT from ___.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:20 a.m. via
