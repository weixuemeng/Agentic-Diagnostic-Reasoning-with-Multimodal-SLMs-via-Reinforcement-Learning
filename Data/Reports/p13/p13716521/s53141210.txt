                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p lap nissen.  Respiratory distress, wheezing. 
 please eval.  (normal to have mediastinal air/subcu emphsema  post lap nissen)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.  Chest CT of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior studies, lung volumes are significantly decreased,
 with bronchovascular crowding and accentuated heart size.  Left basilar
 opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  Significant
 amount of subcutaneous air is present throughout the bilateral thoracic soft
 tissues, postoperative in nature.  The large right paratracheal lymph node is
 again seen, similarly to prior chest radiographs and the prior chest CT.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Severely decreased lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding.  Left
 basilar opacification is likely a combination of fluid and atelectasis.
 
 2.  Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema in the postoperative setting.
