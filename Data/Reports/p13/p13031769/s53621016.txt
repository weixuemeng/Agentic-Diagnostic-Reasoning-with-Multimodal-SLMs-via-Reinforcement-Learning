                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, shortness of breath and bilateral crackles.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is expected
 given patient age and within normal limits.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definitive abnormality demonstrated within the limitations of this study
 technique.  Questionable prominence of interstitial pattern in the lower lobes
 is present and if clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be
 considered.  Alternatively, reassessment of the patient four weeks after
 antibiotic treatment might be considered if infectious etiology is suspected.
