 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abd/pelvis from same day.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epigastric pain, assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are clear
 bilaterally with no signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.  There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  Please refer to findings on
 subsequent CT abdomen and pelvis as there are nodular opacities in the left
 lower lung which are not clearly visualized on chest radiograph.
