                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral malignant pleural effusions and
 pigtail catheters, now with dyspnea.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, making comparison to prior exam slightly limited due to
 different lung volumes.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Bibasilar parenchymal opacities persist.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Left-sided pigtail catheter is partially evaluated. 
 Right-sided pigtail catheter is not well seen on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities.  Poor
 visualization of the right pleural catheter.
