                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and malignant pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen are bilateral small gauge chest tubes.  The chest tube on the left
 appears in good location.  The chest tube on the right is very peripheral with
 the tip projecting over the right lateral ribs.  This is likely in the chest
 wall and not in the pleural space..  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions that have increased compared to the prior exam.  There is volume
 loss at both bases.  There is new infiltrate in both lower lobes as well. 
 There is a possible right lateral pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right-sided chest tube tip is in the chest wall rather than in the pleural
 space with a probable small right lateral pneumothorax and increased right
 effusion.
