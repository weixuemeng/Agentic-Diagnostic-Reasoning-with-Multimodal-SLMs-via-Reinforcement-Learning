                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with epidural abscess. intubated  // please evaluate ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is identified. Although tip is 3.0 cm cranial from the
 carina, it appears somewhat more lateral than expected to the left and
 confirmation of placement in the airway is suggested. Enteric tube is seen
 with tip in the gastric body, side port just above the GE junction. Low lung
 volumes are noted. No focal consolidation identified. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm cranial from the carina although somewhat more
 laterally located than expected. This could be positional. Confirmation of
 tracheal intubation is suggested clinically and if necessary, repeat chest
 x-ray can be performed.
 
 2. Enteric tube side port above the GE junction and can be advanced several cm
 for optimal positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  First impression plan was discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ at time of discovery at 15:00 on ___.
