                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with catatonia and tachycardia  // source of
 infection, volume overload      source of infection, volume overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged with tortuosity of the aorta.  Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary
 vessels is again consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen.
 No evidence of acute focal consolidation.
 
 Of incidental note are surgical clips overlying the right lower chest,
 presumably within breast tissue.
