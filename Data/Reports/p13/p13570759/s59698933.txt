                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, status post endoscopic coil placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
 hyperinflated lungs with increased AP diameter and flattening of the
 diaphragms, consistent with the patient's history of COPD.  Compared to the
 prior study, there has been new coil placement in the right upper lobe.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar opacities are likely a combination of
 atelectasis and overlying soft tissue.  The heart size is mildly enlarged with
 prominent hila, again consistent with mild pulmonary hypertension.  The
 compression fractures in the mid thoracic spine, previously noted in
 ___, are unchanged.  No pneumonia or pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post endobronchial coil placement with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.
