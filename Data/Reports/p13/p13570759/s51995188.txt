                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old woman status post left EBLR presents with
 shortness of breath and worsening of wheezing, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has had endobronchial lung reduction for COPD with
 positioning of multiple bilateral coils, which have stable appearance.  Lung
 volume is reduced with interval increase of bibasilar opacity suspicious for
 developing pneumonia, probably for aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Enlarged
 central pulmonary arteries are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of heterogeneous bibasilar opacities is
 suspicious for developing pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
