                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with hypertension and tachypnea.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has
 increased consistent with increasing atelectasis that is associated with small
 effusion.  Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe likely represent small amount
 of effusion and atelectasis.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.
