                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left on the frontal view.  There is some
 external artifact projecting over the patient on the lateral view.  Mild
 increase in interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to mild interstitial
 edema.  It is difficult to exclude a very trace left pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal study as the patient is rotated to the left.  Slight diffuse
 increase in interstitial markings bilaterally could be due to mild
 interstitial edema.  If patient able, dedicated PA and lateral views with
 better patient positioning would be helpful for further evaluation.
