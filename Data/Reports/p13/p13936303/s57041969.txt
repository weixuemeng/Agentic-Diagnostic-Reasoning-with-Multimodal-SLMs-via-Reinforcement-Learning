                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of prostate
 cancer and gram-negative bacteremia.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained at 12:57 p.m.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is no substantial change in the
 appearance of the mediastinal silhouette.  Left basal opacity on the other
 hand has developed and is concerning for atelectasis.  Slightly more
 pronounced vascular engorgement is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Concern for progression of left lower lobe opacity that might
 reflect developing infection.
