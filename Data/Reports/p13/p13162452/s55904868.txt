 AP CHEST, 8:38 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, NG tube placed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The examination is technically inadequate for most aspects of
 determination, but shows clearly that the nasogastric tube is looped in the
 chest, just above the level of the diaphragm and returns to the thoracic
 inlet.  PA and lateral chest radiograph on ___ showed that
 there is marked dilatation of the lower esophagus, or a hiatus hernia.  It is
 possible that the patient has achalasia.
