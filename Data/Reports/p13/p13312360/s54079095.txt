                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CAD with CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette in a patient who has intact
 midline sternal wires following CABG procedure.  No convincing evidence of
 significant elevation of pulmonary venous pressure or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
