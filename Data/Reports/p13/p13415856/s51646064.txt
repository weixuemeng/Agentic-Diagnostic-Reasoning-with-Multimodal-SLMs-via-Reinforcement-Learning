                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath bilateral lower extremity swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate background pulmonary fibrosis,
 as before with decreased volume of right pleural effusion and persistence of
 left pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Although no focal consolidation is identified, an underlying infectious
 process in the setting of atelectasis and pulmonary fibrosis cannot be
 completely excluded.  Multiple wedge compression deformities within the
 thoracic spine were present previously.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Although no focal consolidation is identified, in the setting of background
 pulmonary fibrosis and bilateral pleural effusions, an underlying infectious
 process cannot be completely excluded.
