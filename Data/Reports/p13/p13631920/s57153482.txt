  The ET tube is in the proximal right mainstem bronchus and should be withdrawn
  approximately 3 cm.  Right central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. 
  Multiple internal and external pacer leads project over the heart. 
  Intra-aortic balloon pump is just below the level of the carina and could be
  advanced approximately 2.5 cm.
  
  Since the prior study there has been significant clearing of left sided
  opacity. There is considerable residual atelectasis at the left base.  The
  right lung is clear.
  
   The findings were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 22:54,

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cabg ETT placement change/ PEEP  // assess
 left side white out
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube is in the proximal right mainstem bronchus. Right central venous
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Intra-aortic balloon pump is just below
 the level of the carina and could be advanced approximately 2.5 cm.
 
 Since the prior study there has been significant improved aeration of the left
 lung.  There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity and small left effusion. 
 The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.
