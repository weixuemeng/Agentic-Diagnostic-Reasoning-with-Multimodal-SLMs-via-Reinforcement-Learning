  1. On the background of chronic pulmonary interstitial disease there is
  interstitial pulmonary edema and hilar indistinctness compatible with mild
  heart failure. There is no focal pulmonary opacity concerning for pneumonia.
  
  2. Large hiatal hernia.
  
  3. Sequela of prior or vertebroplasty is reidentified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  .
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radigraphs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are decreased.  There are diffuse bilateral interstitial
 opacities which appear more conspicuous than in the previous exam, possibly
 due to interstitial pulmonary edema. Regions of patchy opacities of both mid
 lungs are also more pronounced owing to the increased interstitial
 conspicuity. No new focal opacities are identified. There may be a small
 left-sided pleural effusion. Perihilar indistinctness is also more pronounced
 than in the previous exam. Cardiac size is not significantly changed.
 Bilateral optic of calcified plaques are redemonstrated. There is no
 pneumothorax. There is a large hiatal hernia. Dense material in the lower
 thoracic spine is again seen, sequela of prior vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  On the background of chronic pulmonary interstitial disease there are
 increased imterstitial opacites possibly due to  mild heart failure. There is
 no focal pulmonary opacity concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.
 
 3.  Sequela of prior or vertebroplasty is reidentified.
