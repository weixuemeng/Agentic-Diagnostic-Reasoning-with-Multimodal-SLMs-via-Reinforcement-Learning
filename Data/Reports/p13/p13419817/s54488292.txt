                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dizziness.  Question pneumonia 
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Somewhat linear opacity is seen at
 the right lung base.  Retrocardiac mixed lucency and density is most
 suggestive of a hiatal hernia.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Accentuated
 thoracic kyphosis is noted.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right basilar opacity potentially due to atelectasis however developing
 infection is not completely excluded.
