                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chills  // Eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral interstitial opacities likely represent interstitial edema.  There
 is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomegaly persists.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Leftward scoliosis of the thoracic size stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and interstitial opacities, likely due to interstitial edema.  If
 the diagnosis is in doubt clinically, followup radiographs after diuresis may
 be helpful to exclude the possibility of an atypical interstitial pneumonia.
