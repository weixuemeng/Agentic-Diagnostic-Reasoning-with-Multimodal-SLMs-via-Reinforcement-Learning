                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with chest bruising, evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette with
 diffuse interstitial markings is unchanged from prior.  As previously
 suggested, this may reflect chronic interstitial lung disease with
 superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion.  A right-side central line
 terminates in the right atrium.  Although the exam is limited by overlying
 trauma board, there is no displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged prominent interstitial markings reflecting chronic lung
 disease with possible superimposed mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 although not striking.
