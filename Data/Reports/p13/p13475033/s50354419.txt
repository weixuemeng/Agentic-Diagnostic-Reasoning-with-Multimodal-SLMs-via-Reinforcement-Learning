                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP  // evidence of pneumothorax or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.  Chest CT from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly has been stable compared to exams dated back to at least ___.  There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion, otherwise
 the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There has been an
 interval increase in diffuse interstitial markings throughout the lungs
 bilaterally, as well as new small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, very likely secondary to increased
 pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure, on a background of patient's
 known chronic interstitial lung disease.
 
 Short term follow up radiographs after diuresis is recommended to ensure
 resolution and to exclude other process such as atypical pneumonia or acute
 exacerbation of interstitial lung disease.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short term follow up radiographs to exclude atypical
 pneumonia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___ findings d/w Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8:30A on the
 day of the exam by phone.
