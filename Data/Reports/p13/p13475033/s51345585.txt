                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presenting with cough and
 shortness of breath. Evaluate for edema or infiltration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___. Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, as evidenced by flattening of the
 diaphragms on the lateral view. Diffuse interstitial markings, compatible with
 known chronic interstitial lung disease, are unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no focal airspace
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. A coronary
 artery stent is noted.  There is a levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable changes of chronic interstitial lung disease without evidence of a
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
