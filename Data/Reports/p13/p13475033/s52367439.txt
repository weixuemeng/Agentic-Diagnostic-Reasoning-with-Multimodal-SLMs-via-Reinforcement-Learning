                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chronic micronodular lung disease of unclear etiology
 with cough for 10 days.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval improvement in the reticular
 nodular opacities within the lungs with no evidence of new consolidation
 developed on the current examination.  Heart size is enlarged.  Tortuous aorta
 is redemonstrated, most likely related due to presence of scoliosis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
