                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed with possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse
 prominence of interstitial markings.  This could reflect chronic interstitial
 lung disease, possibly with superimposed elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
 
 Central line remains in place.
