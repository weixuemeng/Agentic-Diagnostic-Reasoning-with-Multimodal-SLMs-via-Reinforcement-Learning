 to previous examination and characterized as interstitial lung disease on CT
 chest dated ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No new focal
 opacity. Abnormal contour or of the right hemidiaphragm is stable since ___. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 Limited study of the upper abdomen is unremarkable and visualized osseous
 structures are notable for diffuse osteopenia and a chronic healed left mid
 clavicular fracture. Kyphosis is again noted with multiple thoracic
 compression fractures, unchanged from previous examination.
