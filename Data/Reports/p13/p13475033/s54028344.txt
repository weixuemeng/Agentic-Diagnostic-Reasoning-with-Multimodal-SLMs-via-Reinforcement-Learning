                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and from ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A large-bore central catheter terminates in
 the expected location of the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  The lungs
 are clear.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged though
 unchanged.  Mild indentation of the left trachea at the level of the clavicles
 is unchanged compared to prior chest CT from ___ and likely reflects an
 underlying tracheal deformity as no compressive mass lesion is evident on the
 prior CT.
   
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Unchanged proximal tracheal deformity suggestive of underlying
 tracheomalacia.
