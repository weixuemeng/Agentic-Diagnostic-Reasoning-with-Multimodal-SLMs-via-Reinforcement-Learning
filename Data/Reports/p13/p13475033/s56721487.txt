                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Leukocytosis.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No definitive focal consolidation is
 demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Focal narrowing of the mid trachea is noted and might potentially be related
 to prior intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definitive evidence of infectious process within the limitations of this
 study technique.  If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be
 considered.
