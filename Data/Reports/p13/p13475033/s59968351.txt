                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, concern for sepsis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart
 size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  Diffuse bilateral
 interstitial opacities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged, as before.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly
 tortuous, unchanged.  There is a right tunneled IJ catheter ending in the
 right atrium.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Stable mid-thoracic
 compression fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
