                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rigors.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right-sided hemodialysis catheter
 terminates at the right atrium.  Again seen are reticular interstitial
 opacities distributed evenly across both lungs, stable over multiple prior
 radiographs, previously attributed to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis on
 the chest CT from ___.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unchanged. The central pulmonary vessels appear more prominent since the
 ___ study. Superimposed mild edema cannot be excluded. There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Again seen reticular interstitial opacities distributed evenly
 across both lungs, stable over multiple prior radiographs, previously
 attributed to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  Mild superimposed fluid
 overload cannot be excluded No focal consolidation.
