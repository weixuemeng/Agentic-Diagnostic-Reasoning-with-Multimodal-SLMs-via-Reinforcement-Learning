                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Interstitial lung disease, status post peribronchial biopsy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___ CT.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Large right supraclavicular catheter tip is in
 the cavoatrial junction.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  New right mid lung opacity could be due to small area of
 hemorrhage.  Diffuse peripheral interstitial, right greater than left
 abnormality consistent with interstitial lung disease is unchanged.
