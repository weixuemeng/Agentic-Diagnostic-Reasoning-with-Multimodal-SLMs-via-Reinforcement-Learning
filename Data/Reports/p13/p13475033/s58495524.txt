                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Dual-lumen right subclavian central line is again seen with
 tip at the RA-SVC junction.  Increased interstitial markings seen throughout
 the lungs are again noted and suggestive of chronic interstitial disease. 
 Right mid lung opacity has resolved.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Persistent increased
 interstitial markings in the lungs compatible with chronic interstitial
 disease.  Interval resolution of the right mid lung opacity since prior.
