 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain and right basilar crackles, history of ILD,

 provided clinical history of ILD.  There is no superimposed consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No free air below the right

 acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No superimposed pneumonia in this patient with known ILD.
