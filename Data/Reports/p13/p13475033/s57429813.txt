                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, lower abdominal pain, dysuria, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is a diffuse
 reticular nodular pattern throughout both lungs which indicate mild pulmonary
 edema, though some component of underlying interstitial lung disease is not
 excluded.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  A focal eventration of the
 right hemidiaphragm is noted medially.  The overall cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  Old left clavicular
 midshaft deformity noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticular nodular pattern of the lungs suggests
 interstitial edema, though underlying chronic lung disease not excluded.
