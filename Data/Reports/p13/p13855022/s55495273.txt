                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ? pleural effusion visible on CT AP done
 today  // please evaluate for ? pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the right IJ central line is been removed.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 Extrinsic materials overlie the right the soft tissues of the right upper
 chest.
 
 There is background hyperinflation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged allowing for differences in positioning.  The azygos vein
 appears less engorged.
 
 There has been considerable interval improvement in the left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, though residual opacity and a possible small
 left effusion remain present.  The right pleural effusion is also probably
 improved, with some residual atelectasis at the right base.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and minimal vascular plethora, without
 overt CHF.
 
 Incidental note made of calcified granuloma at the right base medially.
 
 Note is made of subtle slight difference in the degree of density of the
 hemithoraces, more lucent on the left, new, but of uncertain significance. 
 This may be related to some subtle layering pleural fluid on the right,
 particularly if the patient's position was recently changed.
 
 Skin ___ seen in the upper abdomen.  Tubing overlies the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right IJ catheter removed.  No pneumothorax detected.
 2. Considerable interval improvement in left base opacity.
 3. Small bilateral effusions and some bibasilar atelectasis remain present.
 4. Mild vascular plethora, but no overt CHF.
 5. Relative hyperlucency of the left lung, of uncertain significance -
 -possibly related to a small amount of layering fluid on the right.  Attention
 to this area on followup films is requested.
