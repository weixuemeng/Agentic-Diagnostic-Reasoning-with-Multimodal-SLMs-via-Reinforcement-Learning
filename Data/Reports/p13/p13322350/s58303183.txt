                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with bleeding from HD line
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left IJ access dialysis catheter
 is noted with catheter tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 a linear density in the right lower lung which could represent a focus of
 atelectasis.  There is also a linear density in the left mid to lower lung
 which likely also represents a focus of atelectasis.  No signs of pneumonia or
 edema.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 appear normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal atelectasis in the lower lungs.  Hemodialysis catheter appears to be
 positioned appropriately.
