                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman who is unresponsive. Please assess for
 infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures. Increased opacity at right lung base could reflect
 atelectasis or early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 However, there is no definite pneumonia. There is mild atelectasis at the left
 lung base. There is a probable small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax
 identified.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite pneumonia. Increased opacity at right lung base could
 reflect atelectasis or early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
