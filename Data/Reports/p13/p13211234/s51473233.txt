                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:55 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with fever and elevated white count after
 thoracic spinal surgery.  Assess for possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are reasonably well expanded.  At the left lower paraspinal lung base, a
 small area of abnormal lung is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia.  The
 appearance of the posterior mediastinum and paraspinal region is unchanged,
 but this examination is not sensitive for detecting abnormalities in the
 operative bed.  Lungs are otherwise clear, heart size is normal and there is
 no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
