                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post L3-S1 fusion, lateral L1-L3 fusion, and intubation;
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube appears in place at the mid trachea.  Enteric
 tube traverses to the stomach.  Left-sided chest tube is noted with tip at the
 upper portion of the left lung.  Left apical pneumothorax is likely smaller
 and not clearly appreciated.  Lung aeration appears improved.  Bibasilar
 opacities consistent with atelectasis are again noted.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes remain stable.
 
 Post-surgical changes are partially visualized in the spine with vertical rods
 and horizontal screws.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the lungs with appropriate position of lines
 and tubes.  Known left apical pneumothorax is less appreciated on today's
 study.
