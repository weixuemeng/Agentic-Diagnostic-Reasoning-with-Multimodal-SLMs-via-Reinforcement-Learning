                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with scoliosis.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:49.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:19 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There has been interval placement of a
 left chest tube with interval appearance of a small left apical pneumothorax. 
 Lung volumes are markedly diminished with crowding of the vasculature and
 patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult
 to assess due to low volumes, patient rotation and portable technique,
 although the mediastinum does appear somewhat widened.  This can be better
 assessed on followup imaging.
