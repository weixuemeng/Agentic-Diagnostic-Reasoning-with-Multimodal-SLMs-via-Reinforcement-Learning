                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known intraparenchymal hemorrhage with worsening mental status.
 Evaluate after intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 5 cm from the
 carina. Opacification of the left base is likely due to layering fluid from a
 moderate left pleural effusion, as well as atelectasis. There is a small right
 pleural effusion. No focal opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia. There
 is no pneumothorax. Sternal wires are intact, consistent with a prior CABG.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube.
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left than the right.
 3. Left basilar atelectasis.
