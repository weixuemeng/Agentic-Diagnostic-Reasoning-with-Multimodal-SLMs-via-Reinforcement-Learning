                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated but clear of focal opacities.  Calcified left apical scarring is
 identified with superior retraction of the left hilum.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings are seen throughout, potentially due to chronic lung
 disease; however, component of fluid overload is also possible.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Mid
 thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted as well as mild hypertrophic changes in the
 spine.  Wedge deformities of lower thoracic and likely upper lumbar spine are
 identified; however, the chronicity is uncertain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Hyperinflation without definite evidence of consolidation.  Increased
 interstitial markings in the lungs, which could be due to chronic lung
 disease; however, a component of edema is also possible.
 2.  Wedge deformities of lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebral bodies, the
 acuity of which is uncertain, and clinical correlation is suggested.
