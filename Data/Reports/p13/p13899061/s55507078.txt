                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.  The side
 port of nasogastric tube is in close proximity to the expected GE junction and
 could be advanced to ensure positioning distal to this structure.  Subtle
 areas of opacity in the left mid and lower lung region show improvement in the
 left retrocardiac area.  These findings are nonspecific but could potentially
 be due to aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia in the setting of
 recent seizure activity.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in
 this regard.
