                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status and desaturation. 
 Evaluate for volume overload versus aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent hazy
 opacities at the bilateral bases, consistent with layering of pleural effusion
 and adjacent atelectasis, right greater than left.  Overall, this is stable
 from the prior study.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Retrocardiac opacity is
 unchanged.  There has been interval removal of the monitoring and support
 devices.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of bibasilar opacities, likely layering pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
