                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:23.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube,
 terminating approximately 1.1 cm above the level of the carina.  Recommend
 withdrawal by approximately 2-3 cm.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the
 stomach.  There is severe pulmonary edema/ARDS; this has significantly
 worsened as compared to earlier the same date, ___ at 15:29.  There is
 also more confluent opacity at the lateral right upper lung, which could be
 due to layering fluid or underlying consolidation.  The left aortic border at
 the level of the aortic arch is difficult to assess due to the adjacent
 perihilar opacity.  Superimposed infection is not excluded.
