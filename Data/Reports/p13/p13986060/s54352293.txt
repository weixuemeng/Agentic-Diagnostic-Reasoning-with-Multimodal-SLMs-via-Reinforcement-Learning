                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post motor vehicle crash.  Evaluate for
 injuries.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiographic examination.  Although no rib
 fractures are identified, the study has suboptimal sensitivity for the
 detection of rib fracture and if there is further clinical concern, dedicated
 rib views should be performed.
