                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with pain in the head.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The aortic arch shows patchy calcification.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is a small eventration of the right hemidiaphragm
 anteriorly.  Streaky opacities in the right middle lobe are more suggestive of
 atelectasis or scarring than pneumonia or sequela of injury.  Background
 interstitial abnormality is suggestive of a slight fluid overload.  Thin
 anterior flowing osteophytes are noted along the mid thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of injury.  Findings suggest mild fluid
 overload.
