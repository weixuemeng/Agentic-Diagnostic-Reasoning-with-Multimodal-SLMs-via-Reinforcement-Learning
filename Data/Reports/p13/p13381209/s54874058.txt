  Consider PA and lateral to further characterize these findings.

 INDICATION:   ___F with dyspnea  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacities more conspicuous on the current exam. While some of
 this could be technical, underlying consolidation atelectasis and or effusion
 are also possible. There is a probable right pleural effusion. Superiorly, the
 right lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged as is the right hilum,
 similar compared to prior. Right shoulder arthroplasty changes in subluxations
 appear chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 More dense retrocardiac opacity potentially technical although underlying
 atelectasis and possible effusion is suspected. Small right pleural effusion.
 Consider PA and lateral to further characterize these findings.
