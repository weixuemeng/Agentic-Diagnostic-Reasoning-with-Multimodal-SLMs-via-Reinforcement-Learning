                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer with chest pain
 radiating to the back.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Enlargement of the hila bilaterally is
 unchanged, and compatible with of the history of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension. The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with evidence
 of volume loss in the right lung and mild rightward shift of mediastinal
 structures.  Postsurgical scarring in the right lung base are also similar
 compared to the prior study.  There is a small to moderate size hiatal hernia.
 No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  Minimal patchy right basilar
 opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or infection.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.  Chronic right costophrenic angle blunting is compatible with
 pleural thickening.  Multiple old right-sided rib deformities are again
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postsurgical changes of the right lung with patchy opacity in the right lung
 base possibly reflecting atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be
 excluded.
