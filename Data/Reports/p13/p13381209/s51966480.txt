 edema, pneumonia, effusion?      Pulmonary edema, pneumonia, effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to study of ___, there is again substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette without substantial pulmonary vascular congestion. This
 discordance raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. 
 Hazy opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Less prominent changes are
 seen at the right base and costophrenic angle.
 Of incidental note is a right shoulder arthroplasty.
