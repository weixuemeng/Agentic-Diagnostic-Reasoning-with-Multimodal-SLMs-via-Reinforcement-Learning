                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion  // eval for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Perihilar opacities may be due
 to pulmonary vascular congestion although underlying infectious process is
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral perihilar and infrahilar opacities most likely related to pulmonary
 vascular congestion/ mild pulmonary edema; however, underlying infection is
 difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  Cardiomegaly.
