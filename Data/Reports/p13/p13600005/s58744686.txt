                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left-sided rib pain, history of small cell lung
 cancer, radiation therapy yesterday now with constipation and abdominal
 distention.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An airway stent is noted within a right lower lobe bronchus, best visualized
 on the lateral view. An air-fluid level within the right lower lobe
 corresponds to a cavitary lesion as noted on the previous CT. Small right
 pleural effusion is again noted along with a large right perihilar mass with
 resultant right lower lobe atelectasis.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with
 widening of the right paratracheal stripe is re- demonstrated.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess but appears mildly enlarged, similar compared to the prior
 exam. A moderate size hiatal hernia is again noted. Left lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen. No free air is
 seen under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Air-fluid level in the right lower lobe corresponds to known cavitary
 lesion as seen on the prior chest CT.
 2. Small right pleural effusion, right perihilar mass, and right lower lobe
 atelectasis are all similar compared to the prior radiograph.
 3. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
