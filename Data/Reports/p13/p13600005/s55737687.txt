                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion status post chest tube with increasing
 pain and shortness of breath after instillation of TPA.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax and worsening pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study, the position of the right pleural
 catheter is unchanged.  The degree of right pleural effusion is minimally
 decreased.  The amount of aerated right lung is slightly decreased, possibly
 due to atelectasis and lower lung volume.  The left lung is clear aside from
 poor inspiratory volume.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in lung volumes with apparent improvement in
 right pleural effusion and unchanged position of right pleural catheter. 
 Slightly more atelectasis is seen at the right lung.
