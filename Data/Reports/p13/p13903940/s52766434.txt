 INDICATION:  ___M h/o AAA s/p repair ___, afib on apixaban w/ para-anastomic
 AAA s/p EVAR w/bilat renal, SMA stents,celiac coverage w/hypercarbic resp
 failure on POD-___  // volume status
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There are streaky
 opacities at the lung bases which may represent atelectasis or developing
 infiltrates.  There is also prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings
 centrally suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  There are no pneumothoraces. 
 There is likely a small pleural effusion on the left side.
