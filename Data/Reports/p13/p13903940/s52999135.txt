 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are stable and in appropriate position.

 vascular pedicle, pulmonary edema, and layering right pleural effusion.  Lung
 volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis.  Opacity at the left lung base is
 persistent.  No pneumothorax.  Surgical clips overlying the left upper chest
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Significantly improved pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion since

 2. Persistent left basilar opacity likely represents combination of
 atelectasis and residual pulmonary edema, however in the right clinical
 setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
