                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, chest pain// r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overlying trauma board limits assessment. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is
 borderline enlarged, but accentuated due to the low lung volumes. Mediastinal
 contour is normal. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified though subtle increased lucency at the right lung base and along
 the right heart border could suggest a small pneumothorax. Deformity of the
 left seventh lateral rib appears to be chronic. No acutely displaced fracture
 is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased lucency within the right lung base along the right heart
 border suggests a small pneumothorax. Please see subsequent CT of the torso
 for further details.
