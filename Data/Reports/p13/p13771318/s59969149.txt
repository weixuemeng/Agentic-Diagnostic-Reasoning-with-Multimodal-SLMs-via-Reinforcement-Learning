 HISTORY:  Intermittent labored breathing and decreased breath sounds at the
 right lung base.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta again
 shows moderate unfolding with calcifications seen along the aortic arch.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Minimal residual left
 lingular atelectasis persists but has decreased.  The lungs appear otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
