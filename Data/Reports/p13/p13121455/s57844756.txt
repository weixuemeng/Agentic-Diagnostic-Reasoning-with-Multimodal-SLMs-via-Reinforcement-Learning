                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  3 weeks of cough, now with recent fever to 102.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Given this, there is persistent blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion,
 similar to prior.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  There is no left
 pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There may be very minimal vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a small right
 pleural effusion.  Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
