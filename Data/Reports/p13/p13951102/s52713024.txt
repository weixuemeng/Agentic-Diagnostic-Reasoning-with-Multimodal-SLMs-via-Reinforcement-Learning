                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed the same date ___
 at 9:44 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a sharply
 demarcated homogeneously opaque structure causing mass effect on the lateral
 aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.  When compared to the CT, this corresponds
 to the fluid collection between the dome of the liver and the right
 hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Fluid collection, better evaluated on the CT, superiorly displacing the
 lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
