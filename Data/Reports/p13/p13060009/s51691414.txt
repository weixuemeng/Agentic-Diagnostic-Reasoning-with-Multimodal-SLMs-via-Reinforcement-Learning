                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic scoliosis, right-sided
 basilar crackles on examination, evaluate for fluid and atelectasis at the
 right base.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's chest deformity and clinical condition required
 examination in sitting position using AP frontal and left lateral views. 
 Comparison is made to the next preceding chest examination of ___. 
 On frontal view, chest presentation resembles a deep left anterior oblique
 view, demonstrating cardiac contours that indicate mild enlargement.  The
 thoracic aorta appears moderately widened and elongated and follows in its
 descending portion the markedly scoliosis-deformed thoracic spine.  Lungs
 appear clear without pulmonary congestion and no evidence of acute
 infiltrates.  The lateral pleural sinuses are free.  Lateral view is helpful
 to disclose the posterior dependent area of the pleural sinuses and they
 appear to be clear from any pleural fluid accumulation on both sides.  In
 comparison with the next previous portable chest examination of ___, the chest findings can be identified as stable.  The previously existing
 marked gas-distended large and small bowel loops are less impressive now.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pleural effusions or atelectasis.  Right lung base
 is clear.
