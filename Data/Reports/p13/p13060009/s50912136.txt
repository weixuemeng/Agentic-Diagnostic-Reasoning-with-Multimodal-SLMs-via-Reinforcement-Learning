                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough x 2 weeks with developing wheezing and decreased bibasilar
 breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Given the patient's body habitus, evaluation is extremely limited. Frontal and
 lateral chest radiographs demonstrate chronic scoliosis and a mildly enlarged
 cardiac silhouette which is unchanged from prior radiographs.  Low lung
 volumes make evaluation difficult, but a focal opacity in the left lower lung
 probably represents atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A left lower lung opacity probably represents atelectasis.
