                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to CT scan from 11:59
 p.m. from the same day and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  NG tube is seen with tip projecting off the inferior field of view,
 side port is not clearly delineated but is certainly beyond the GE junction. 
 Large amount of gas-filled bowel is seen in the upper abdomen.  There is
 lucency below the right and left hemidiaphragm, potentially within a
 gas-filled stomach on the left and potentially loops of colon on the right,
 however, the configuration is slightly different when compared to CT scan and
 repeat exam is recommended to exclude possibility of free intraperitoneal air
 given change in appearance.
 
 Appearance of the lungs is unchanged and limited due to the severe scoliosis. 
 No large confluent consolidation is identified.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures notable for probable
 proximal left humeral fracture which appears old.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lucency below the hemidiaphragms, potentially due to dilated
 air-filled stomach and bowel; however, given differences in configuration
 compared to CT scan from earlier the same date, two-view chest x-ray/
 abdominal films is suggested for further evaluation given possibility of free
 intraperitoneal air.  
 
 Findings were discussed with ___ at 7:20 on ___ on the
 phone at time of discovery.
