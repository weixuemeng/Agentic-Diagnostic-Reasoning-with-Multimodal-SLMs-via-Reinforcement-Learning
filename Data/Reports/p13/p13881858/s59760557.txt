                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with respiratory failure.  Status post intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Three semi-upright AP views of the chest, first obtained at 16:01,
 the second obtained at 16:06, and the final obtained at 16:08
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Initial two views of the chest demonstrate right mainstem intubation with
 collapse of the left lung.
 
 The third and final view in the series demonstrates the endotracheal tube to
 terminate approximately 2.8 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube tip is within
 the stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Patchy ill-defined opacities are
 noted within the left upper and mid lung fields as well as within the right
 lung base concerning for multifocal infection.  More focal opacity within the
 retrocardiac region likely reflects atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are better appreciated on the recent CT.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Multiple soft tissue masses are seen throughout the thoracic cage
 and paraspinal regions.  Known diffuse myeloma involvement of the osseous
 structures is better assessed on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Final radiograph in this series of 3 images demonstrates the endotracheal
 tube tip to be slightly low lying, terminating approximately 2.8 cm from the
 carina.  Enteric tube is in standard position.
 2. Multifocal airspace opacities concerning for pneumonia.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Known pleural effusions are better
 assessed on the previous CT.
 4. Re- demonstration of multiple masses associated with the rib cage and
 thoracic spine.
