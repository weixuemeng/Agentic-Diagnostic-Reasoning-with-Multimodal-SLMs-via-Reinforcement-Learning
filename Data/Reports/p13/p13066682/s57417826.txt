                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Available for comparison is a preceding chest examination dated
 ___.  
 
 As before, there is moderate cardiomegaly with a configuration indicative of
 left ventricular enlargement.  Thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated
 and shows calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch. 
 There is, however, no evidence of local aortic contour abnormalities.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is now a parenchymal infiltrate
 on the right lung base and the lateral view confirms this finding in the form
 of some hazy parenchymal densities and a peripheral plate atelectasis in the
 right lower lobe posterior segment.  No other acute abnormalities are seen;
 however, the lung bases have a generally hyperinflated appearance suggestive
 of COPD.
 
 When comparison is made with the preceding chest examination obtained ___
 years ago, the moderate cardiac enlargement existed already at that time. 
 There existed also a few for pneumonia suspicious infiltrates on the right
 base, but they have changed their appearance to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonic infiltrate in right lower lobe posterior segment. 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement but no evidence of CHF.  Followup chest
 examination after treatment is recommended in approximately two weeks.
