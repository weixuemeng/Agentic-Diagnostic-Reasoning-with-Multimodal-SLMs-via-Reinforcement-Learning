                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Increasing O2 requirements.  Evaluate for failure.
 
 CHEST, AP SEMISUPINE
 
 The heart remains somewhat enlarged as on the prior chest x-ray.  Opacities
 are now noted in the left lower lobe and a rounded density in the right lower
 lobe is seen peripherally.  This was not present on the prior two chest x-rays
 and is likely therefore some acute process rather than a mass.
 
 The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat more prominent and I suspect the
 presence of new onset of failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased lung densities particular in the lower lobes likely due
 to failure.
