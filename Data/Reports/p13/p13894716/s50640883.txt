                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are persistent bilateral interstitial infiltrates likely representing
 edema.  In addition, there is increased density in the retrocardiac area
 consistent with atelectasis and possibly consolidation.  Streaky density
 consistent with subsegmental atelectasis in the middle lobe is no longer
 apparent.  An endotracheal tube nasogastric tube and right internal jugular
 catheter remain in place.  Mediastinal structures are stable.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral interstitial infiltrates most consistent with edema.  Continued
 evidence of left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation.
