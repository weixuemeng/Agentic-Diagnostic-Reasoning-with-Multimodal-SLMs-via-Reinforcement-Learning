                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post MVCR with multiple rib fractures and
 manubrium fracture.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minimally displaced right-sided
 rib fractures appear similar compared to prior trauma radiographs from
 ___ and are better characterized on followup CT torso from the
 same day.  Known left-sided rib fractures are also better characterized on
 prior CT.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Linear opacities in the lung
 bases correspond with known subsegmental atelectasis including increased left
 basilar opacity since the prior radiographs.  The left upper lung appears
 better aerated, however.  New mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles suggestive of developing small bilateral pleural effusions.  A known
 manubrium fracture is not well characterized on this single frontal view. 
 Mediastinal contours appear similar compared to recent prior suggesting
 probable stability of the known retrosternal hematoma. Hilar and cardiac
 contours are within normal limits.  Cervical spinal hardware is incompletely
 imaged.  There has been interval placement of probable epidural catheter in
 the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged multiple rib fractures, better characterized on prior CT.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Stable mediastinal contours, though incompletely evaluated manubrial
 fracture and retrosternal hematoma.
 
 3.  New left basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis.
 
 4.  Suspected very small developing pleural effusions.
