                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  History of mildly displaced left rib due to rib
 fractures.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is stable appearance of the mediastinum and the heart.  There is
 substantial improvement of bilateral bibasilar aeration with decrease in
 pleural effusion.  There is right upper lobe opacity, less pronounced than on
 the prior study but still present and might reflect area of scarring, although
 pulmonary nodule not seen on the chest CT due to obscuration by the
 consolidations might be a possibility and should be followed in three months
 with chest radiograph.
 
 Displaced first left rib fracture is redemonstrated.  The rest of the ribs do
 not show substantial evidence of displacement.
