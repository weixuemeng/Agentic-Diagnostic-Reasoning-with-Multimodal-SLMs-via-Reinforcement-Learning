                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fracture with worsening hypoxia, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly less
 opacification at the left base.  This is most consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 acute focal pneumonia.
