                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, on the frontal view the pleural
 effusion is less prominent.  However, this may merely reflect the upright
 position with the fluid gravitating into the lower portions of the lung. 
 There is a small effusion on the left.
 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  There is poor definition of the right heart border
 with a streak of opacification running obliquely in the anterior portion on
 the lateral view.  This raises the question of some volume loss in the middle
 lobe.
