                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 are bibasilar streaky opacities probably compatible with atelectasis,
 including suspected volume associated with mild relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Elevation of the
 left hemidiaphragm is noted.  Deformities of the lower right posterior ribs
 likely relate to remote trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable atelectasis at the lung bases, greater on the left than right,
 although aspiration and/or infection are not completely excluded.
 
 2.  Old right posterior rib fractures.
