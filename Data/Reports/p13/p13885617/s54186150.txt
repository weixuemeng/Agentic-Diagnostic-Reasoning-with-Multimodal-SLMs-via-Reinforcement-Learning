                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p tiss AVR, ASD closure  // predischarge
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the right IJ is not significantly changed in position, and likely
 terminates in the upper right atrium.  Prostatic heart valve is unchanged.
 
 Streaky right perihilar opacities most likely represent subsegmental
 atelectasis, also noted at the lung bases.  There is no focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions is larger on the left, which are not
 definitely appreciated on the prior supine portable radiograph.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left greater than right pleural effusions, not appreciated on the prior
 supine radiograph.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
