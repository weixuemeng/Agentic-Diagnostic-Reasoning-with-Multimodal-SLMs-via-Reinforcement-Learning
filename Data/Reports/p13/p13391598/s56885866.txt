                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with large iph  // Fever + leukocytosis, eval
 pneumonia, aspiration?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion are stable. New patchy bibasilar opacities could
 potentially due to acute aspiration given clinical suspicion for this entity. 
 Lucency below left hemidiaphragm is probably due to gas within the stomach,
 but additional left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen could be obtained to
 exclude the possibility of free intraperitoneal air if warranted clinically.
