                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ?hypoxia  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient's overlying chin obscures the medial lung apices.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen. Left base
 opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis although
 underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices, partially obscuring the view. 
 There are also low lung volumes.  Given the above, there are small to moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Left base opacity may
 be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly.
