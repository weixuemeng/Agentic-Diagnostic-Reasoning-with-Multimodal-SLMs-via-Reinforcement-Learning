                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Right middle lobe consolidation previously.  Treated with
 antibiotics.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous heterogeneous opacification in the left mid lung has improved.  A
 less certain region of abnormality in the right middle lobe has a similar
 radiographic appearance allowing for better inspiration today.  I doubt there
 is a significant abnormality there, but if there are any referable symptoms, I
 would repeat the chest radiographs in four weeks, supplemented by oblique
 views and have the radiologist review them before the patient leaves the
 department.
 
 Lungs are otherwise well expanded and the upper lungs are entirely clear. 
 Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion or evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement.
