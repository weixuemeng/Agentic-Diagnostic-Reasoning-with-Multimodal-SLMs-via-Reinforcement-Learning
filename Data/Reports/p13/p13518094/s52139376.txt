                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma treated with CD20
 monoclonal antibody who developed pulmonary edema and possible early
 bronchiectasis flare/LLL pneumonia vs. capillary leak/pulmonary edema post
 last treatment ___  // assess for change in pulmonary edema/LLL opacity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Compare chest radiographs of ___, ___,
 the ___
 CT chest with contrast ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The previously noted left lower lung opacity appears almost completely
 resolved, consistent with atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Stable
 cardiomegaly.  The implanted subcutaneous device on the anterior chest wall is
 in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Opacity
 projecting anteriorly on lateral view in the right middle lobe is likely
 lymphadenopathy, given patient history, but can be better assessed on recent
 CT Chest.  A nodule is in the left upper lobe projecting between the ___ and
 ___ anterior ribs, also better seen on recent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Near complete resolution of left lower lung atelectasis.
 2. A focal opacity projecting anteriorly on lateral view in the middle lobe is
 better assessed on recent CT Chest.  Additionally, a nodule is seen projecting
 between the ___ and ___ anterior ribs, but is also better assessed on recent
 CT.
