                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of bibasilar bronchiectasis, now
 presenting with one month of cough, worsening over the last week.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a subtle opacity within the medial
 right lung base seen on the frontal view only.  It is uncertain if this
 represents middle lobe consolidation or overlapping vessels.  Oblique
 radiographs or a lordotic view would help confirm or deny the presence of
 consolidation in the middle lobe.  Linear opacities within the left mid lung
 are due to subsegmental atelectasis within the lingula.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Lingular atelectasis may be the sequelae of bronchitis
 2. Questional right middle lobe consolidation. Additional oblique radiographs
 or a lordotic view would be helpful for further assessment.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated above results and recommendations to Dr.
 ___ at 1:34 pm on ___ by telephone.
