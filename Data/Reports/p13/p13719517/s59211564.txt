 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette is
 moderate to severely enlarged.  Aortic knob remains calcified.  No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 Trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude.  There is minimal
 interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette again seen with minimal
 interstitial edema.
