                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Oxygen requirement, evaluate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ commonly ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There has been near resolution of the small bilateral pleural
 effusions with residual mild pulmonary edema.  Increased opacity is again seen
 in the right upper lobe, although, appears improved from prior.  The left apex
 appears better aerated as well.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 A right internal jugular central line terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Near resolution of small bilateral pleural effusions 
 2.  Improving pulmonary edema. Improving confluent right upper lobe opacity
 may reflect improving asymmetric edema or a secondary process such as an
 infection.
