                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AAA repair with pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___ and a ___.
 
 FINDINGS: There is worsened interstitial opacification, consistent with
 worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  Bilateral small pleural effusions and
 multifocal basilar pneumonia are unchanged.  New increased airspace
 opacification within the upper lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  
 
 A right jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsened moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 
 2.  New bilateral upper lobe airspace opacities may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema or developing pneumonia.
 3.  Unchanged multifocal pneumonia at the lung bases.
