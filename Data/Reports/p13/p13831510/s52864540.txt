                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with persistent oxygen requirement, lung
 opacities status post diuresis.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 18:21.
 
 Single portable upright chest film, ___ at 7:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged.
 There are persistent biapical and bibasilar opacities, with a more
 consolidative appearance at the right apex.  There are associated small
 layering effusions.  Overall, the findings have slightly improved, suggesting
 a resolving, but persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, although the
 persistent opacity at the right apex is somewhat concerning for aspiration
 pneumonia.  Continued followup imaging would be advised.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
