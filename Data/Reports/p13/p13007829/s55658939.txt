                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with dyspnea; ? evidence of CHF  // CHF; other
 cause for dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Mild vascular crowding in the right infrahilar
 region is compatible with changes seen on the prior film.  Minimal atelectasis
 at the left base is also again noted.  No CHF, focal consolidation or effusion
 is identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Doubt significant interval change.
