                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain after MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are slightly low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for lung
 volumes.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.  There is no air under the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrathoracic injury.
