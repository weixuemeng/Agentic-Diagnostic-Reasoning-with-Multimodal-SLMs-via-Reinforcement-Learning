                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with rhabdomyolysis who was just intubated.  Please
 evaluate ET tube placement and OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently this
 morning at 05:27.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates at the level of the carina.  The tip of the
 OG tube projects over the expected location of the stomach, however, the side
 port is most likely in the esophagus and should be advanced.  A right
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the upper-to-mid SVC.  Poor
 penetration somewhat limits evaluation; however, there is no significant
 change in pulmonary congestion and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Small pleural effusions may be present, but are not
 evident on this single AP radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminating at the level of the carina and should be withdrawn 3-4
 cm.
 
 2.  OG tube with its sideport in the esophagus, should be advanced to place
 all side ports safely in the stomach.
 
 3.  Grossly unchanged pulmonary congestion and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 ___ at 2:40 p.m. on ___, 20 minutes after discovery.
