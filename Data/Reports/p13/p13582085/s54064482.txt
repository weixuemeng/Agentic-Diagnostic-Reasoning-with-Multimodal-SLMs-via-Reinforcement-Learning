                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Recently placed nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. 
 Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina with the neck in a
 flexed position.  Otherwise, no relevant change in the appearance of the chest
 since the recent study of earlier the same date, allowing for lower lung
 volumes on the current exam.
