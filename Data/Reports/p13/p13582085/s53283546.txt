 INDICATION:  AMS, evaluation of endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.

 the tube is located relatively high and could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  The
 right internal jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
 position.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, unchanged relatively low lung volumes
 and retrocardiac atelectasis, with minimal fluid overload.  No new parenchymal
 opacities.
