                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation. Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent of
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  The remainder of the
 support lines and tubes are unchanged: A right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  The ET tube terminates 5 cm above the
 carina.  
 
 The lung volumes are low.  There are rapidly worsening bilateral lower lobe
 opacities with increased obscuration of both hemidiaphragms likely
 representing a combination of worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion. 
 Underlying infectious consolidation cannot be excluded.  Mild pulmonary
 congestion is also slightly worse.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Rapidly worsening bilateral lower lobe opacities likely represent a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion. Differential diagnosis includes
 aspiration and infectious consolidation.
 
 2. Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary congestion, slightly worse than yesterday
