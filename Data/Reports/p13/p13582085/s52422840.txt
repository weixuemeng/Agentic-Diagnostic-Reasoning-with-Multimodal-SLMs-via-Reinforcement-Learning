                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral lower extremity edema.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT angiogram of the chest
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  There is minimal heterogeneous opacity in
 the right lower lobe, which is a chronic finding based on multiple prior
 studies.  On the CTA it was felt to represent a combination of air trapping
 and atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart is minimally
 enlarged, also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia or decompensated heart failure.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe is a chronic abnormality.
