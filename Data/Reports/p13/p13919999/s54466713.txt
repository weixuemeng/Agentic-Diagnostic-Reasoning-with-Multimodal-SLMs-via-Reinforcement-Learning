                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent fever and elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There has been interval
 increase of the lung volumes.  Resolution of the right basilar opacity, which
 was likely vascular crowding from low lung volumes.  There is opacification at
 the left base, which may represent atelectasis, however, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent pneumonia.  No other focal areas of
 opacification are noted.  The heart, mediastinum, and hilar contours are
 normal.  No pleural abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1. Overall improvement in lung volumes with resolution of right
 basilar opacity.
 2. Left basilar opacity, which may be atelectasis or pneumonia, in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
