 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left chest tube.  Lung volumes remain low with
 patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.  Sutural material
 seen in the left apex.  No definite pneumothorax can be seen.  Crowding the
 pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  Lucency within the left lateral chest
 wall soft tissues is consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.  No focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion.
