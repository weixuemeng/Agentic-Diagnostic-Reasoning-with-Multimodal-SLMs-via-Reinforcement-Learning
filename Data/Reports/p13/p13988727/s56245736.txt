                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with nausea, chest wall pain after
 recent lung biopsies, assess for patient's effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size cannot be assessed accurately because of blunting
 densities in the left lung base.  Significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely.
 Thoracic aorta of unchanged appearance without local contour abnormalities. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There exist some linear densities
 in the left upper lobe area that appear to be unchanged and most likely
 represent scar formations.  On the left base, a moderate amount of pleural
 effusion obliterates the entire diaphragmatic contour and blunts the left
 pleural sinus.  This extends into the posterior pleural sinuses as seen on the
 lateral view.  The amount of pleural density appears to be same in comparison
 with the previous study of ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved inspiration, but left-sided linear pulmonary
 scars and pleural effusion remaining.  No new pulmonary or cardiovascular
 abnormalities identified.
