                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right sided chest pain and right sided back
 pain beginning 1.5 weeks ago  // known pleural effusion and mass in the right
 upper lobe on outside hospital x-ray 1 week ago
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged though there is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion is
 demonstrated with streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis
 though superimposed on the patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease. 
 2.2 cm focal opacity is seen projecting over the right upper lobe, which was
 previously noted to be appear as a more vague opacity on the prior exam. No
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. 2.2 cm focal opacity projecting within the right upper lobe which may
 reflect a more confluent area of chronic interstitial lung disease/fibrosis as
 a vague opacity was demonstrated in this region on the previous chest
 radiograph. Further assessment with chest CT is suggested.
 2. Small to moderate size right pleural effusion with streaky bibasilar
 atelectasis likely superimposed on the patient's known chronic interstitial
 lung disease.
