                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided abdominal pain status post VATS, lung biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are present.  Small left pleural effusion is
 relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.  Left basilar patchy opacity
 likely reflects atelectasis.  Suture material within the left lung apex is
 unchanged.  Mild right basilar atelectasis is redemonstrated.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is present. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Subcutaneous gas within the left lateral chest wall soft tissues has decreased
 in the interval.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar
 opacity, likely reflective of atelectasis.  Low lung volumes.  Interval
 decrease in amount of subcutaneous gas in the left lateral chest wall.
