                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female feeling unwell since last night with fever,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours

 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild opacification at bilateral lung bases likely
 represents overlying soft tissues. Calcification of the common carotid artery,
 particularly on the right is incidentally noted.
