                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain after fall  // is there rib
 fracture, pneumothorax, effusion?      is there rib fracture, pneumothorax,
 effusion?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes are substantially lower producing crowding of the vasculature
 particularly in the lower lungs, without real change.  No pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
