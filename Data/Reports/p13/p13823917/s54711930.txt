                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  In addition to
 tortuosity of the aorta, the heart is again mild to moderately enlarged with a
 left ventricular configuration.  There is similar mild relative elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  Trace bilateral pleural
 effusions are suspected. There is vague but apparently increased opacity in
 the left upper lobe.  Mild interstitial changes at the lung bases and vague
 right upper lung opacity appear unchanged and suggest chronic scarring or
 perhaps mild interstitial disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left upper lobe opacities, possibly atelectasis or scarring, but
 developing pneumonia is possible.  Follow-up radiographs are suggested in
 approximately six weeks.
