                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia status post plasty.
 Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference CT dated ___ and multiple prior chest
 radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Current exam is highly limited due to slight motion degradation as
 well as down cast chin obscuring the right upper lung.  Allowing for such,
 right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis in the right lung appears
 similar to slightly decreased as compared to one day prior.  There is
 suggestion of pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank edema.  Left
 basilar atelectasis is redemonstrated, possibly with a tiny effusion.  There
 is no pneumothorax in the left lung.  The right upper lung is obscured. 
 Postoperative mediastinal widening is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam demonstrating no significant change since one day
 ago.  However, consider removal of overlying devices and true upright patient
 position to optimize evaluation for follow up exams.
