                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia status post
 tracheoplasty with fluid overload and respiratory distress.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams including most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent
 prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, likely accentuated by low lung volumes
 and AP technique.  There is persistent vascular engorgement, and bilateral
 pleural effusions with atelectasis.  Allowing for slight technical
 differences, upper lung aeration does not appear substantially changed,
 certainly not significantly improved.  A left-sided PICC has tip terminating
 approximately 3 cm below the carina, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable pulmonary edema as compared to one day prior.
