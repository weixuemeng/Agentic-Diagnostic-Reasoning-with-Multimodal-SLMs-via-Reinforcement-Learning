                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is
 still enlarged but less prominent and the degree of vascular engorgement has
 decreased.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes and possible small pleural effusions
 persist.  The left PICC line is difficult to evaluate on this study, though
 probably still is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
