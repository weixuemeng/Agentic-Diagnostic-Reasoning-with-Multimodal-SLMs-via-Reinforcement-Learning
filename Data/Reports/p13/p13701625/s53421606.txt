                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slight flattening of the diaphragms could reflect mild COPD.  Slight
 distortion of the parenchymal markings in the right lung could also reflect
 emphysematous change.
 
 Allowing for this, the heart is at the upper limits of normal in size.  The
 aorta is unfolded.  No CHF, focal infiltrate, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable background emphysematous change.  Heart size at the upper limits of
 normal.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
