 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indwelling monitoring and support devices are stable and in appropriate
 position.  Lung volumes are extremely low with increased diffuse opacification
 which may represent vascular crowding and atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes or mild pulmonary edema.  Opacification of the left costophrenic
 angle suggests a layering pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
