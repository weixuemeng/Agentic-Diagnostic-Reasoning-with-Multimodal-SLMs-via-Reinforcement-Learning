                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease with a GI bleed, status post
 transfusions.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema or effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained with a total of
 two exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.3 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the
 field of view.  
 
 Again, there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, likely due to small
 effusion.  There is no right effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 mild vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema, improved from the
 prior exam.  There is minimal left basilar atelectasis.  There is no focal
 airspace opacity to suggest a pneumonia.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Interval improvement in the mild vascular congestion.
