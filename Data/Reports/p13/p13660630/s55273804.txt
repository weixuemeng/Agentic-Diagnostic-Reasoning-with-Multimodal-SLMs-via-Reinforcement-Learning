                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fevers, productive cough  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is patchy medial left upper lung opacity and mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, in combination may represent left upper lobe atelectasis. 
 However, consolidation due to pneumonia may also be present.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is stable in size and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Concern for left upper lobe atelectasis/partial collapse ; however, left upper
 to mid lung opacity could also relate to pneumonia.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
