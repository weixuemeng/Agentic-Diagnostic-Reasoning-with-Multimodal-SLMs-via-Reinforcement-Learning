                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Right chest pain s/p fall, tenderness to
 mid-axillary line, ___th ribs  // Eval for rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is normal.  No displaced rib fractures are
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen,
 conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to
 the chest wall is clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal
 findings  should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail
 radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
