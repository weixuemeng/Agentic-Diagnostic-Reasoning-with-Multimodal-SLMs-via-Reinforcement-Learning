                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with concern for aspiration on the ventilator.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 02:22 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is very limited due to poor patient positioning and
 technique.  The endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this
 image.  There is increased opacification of the right lung base from a most
 recent prior study and worsening left basilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is seen without overt pulmonary edema.  No large pleural
 effusion is appreciated.  The imaged cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Very limited examination with increased opacification of the right lung
 base from 11 hours earlier that could represent aspiration and worsening left
 basilar atelectasis.  
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
