 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:49
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with acute respiratory distress, question edema.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:06.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:49 a.m. is submitted and
 compared to the prior study of ___ at 13:06.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of nasogastric tube. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  The mandible obscures the right apex.  Lung volumes remain low. 
 There are streaky retrocardiac opacities, which may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  There has been interval appearance of a 2.5 cm nodular opacity
 at the right lung base, which could reflect focal infectious process, focal
 infarct/hemorrhage, or loculated fluid.  Clinical correlation is advised and
 followup imaging should be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
