                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited as the patient's chin and soft tissues of the
 neck obscure evaluation of the apices.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart size
 is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are otherwise unchanged.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis, with no focal consolidation
 identified.  No pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is seen.  Old
 left-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Low lung volumes with left basilar patchy opacity likely
 reflecting atelectasis.
