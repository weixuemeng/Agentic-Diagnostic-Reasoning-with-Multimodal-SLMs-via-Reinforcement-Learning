                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable frontal image of the chest.  The ET tube terminates 7.2 cm
 above the carina.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is opacity at the right
 lung base and a possible opacity in the left lung base, which may represent
 atelectasis, but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical
 setting.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 7.2 cm above the carina and needs to be advanced 4 cm. 
 
 
 2.  Opacity in the right lung base which may represent atelectasis, but cannot
 exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Possible
 opacity in the left lobe, as well.  Lateral view would allow for better
 evaluation of these opacities. 
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 10:02 a.m. on ___
 by phone.
