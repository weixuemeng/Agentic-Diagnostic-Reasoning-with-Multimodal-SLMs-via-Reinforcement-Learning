                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, they are extremely low lung
 volumes.  There are areas of opacification at both bases, slightly more
 prominent on the left.  Although this could merely reflect a post-procedure
 atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
