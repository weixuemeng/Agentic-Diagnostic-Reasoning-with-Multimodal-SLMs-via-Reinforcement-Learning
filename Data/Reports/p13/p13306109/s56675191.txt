                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CML, dyspnea, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval removal of a previously seen right-sided PICC.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen.  There are some linear streaky basilar opacities,
 similar compared to prior on the lateral view, which most likely relate to
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
