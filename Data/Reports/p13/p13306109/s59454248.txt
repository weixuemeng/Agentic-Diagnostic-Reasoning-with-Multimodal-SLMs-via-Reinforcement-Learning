                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Leukocytosis and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable including mild cardiomegaly.  Bibasal
 consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions are noted, overall slightly
 improved since the prior study as well as there is minimal improvement of mild
 pulmonary edema with no evidence of pulmonary edema seen on the current study.
 
 The right central venous line tip is most likely in the cavoatrial junction or
 proximal right atrium and to secure its position above the cavoatrial junction
 it should be pulled back approximately 1.5 cm.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.
