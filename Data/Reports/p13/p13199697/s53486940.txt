                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatic cyst s/p NJ tube placement s/p
 dilodgement and repositioning by patient.  // Please confirm placement.    
 Please confirm placement.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a nasojejunal tube, which appears to extend beyond the ligament of Treitz into
 the jejunum.  However, an abdominal study would be necessary to optimally
 follow the course of the tube.
 Mild atelectatic changes and probable small effusion are again seen on the
 left.  Right subclavian catheter again extends to the mid to lower portion of
 the SVC.
