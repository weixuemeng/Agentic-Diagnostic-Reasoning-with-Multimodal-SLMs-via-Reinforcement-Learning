                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dyspnea, wheezing, O2 requirement in
 setting of  h/o UC s/p proctectomy and ileal pouch, anal anastomosis,
 diverting loop ileostomy p/w dehydration ?sepsis, s/p IR drainage of pelvic
 abscess  // Evaluate for pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the cardiomegaly and
 pulmonary vascular congestion are persistent findings.  Although atelectasis
 at the left lung base has improved in the interval, heterogeneous opacities in
 the right upper and mid lung have worsened.  The latter could reflect
 multifocal aspiration, asymmetrical edema, or rapidly developing infection. 
 As some of the right lung opacities have a somewhat nodular configuration,
 short-term followup radiographs or CT may be helpful to exclude septic emboli.
