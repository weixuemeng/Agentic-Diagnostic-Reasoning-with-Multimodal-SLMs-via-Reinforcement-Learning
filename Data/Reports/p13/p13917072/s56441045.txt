                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough/fever, history of mycobacterium ___ infxn//
 eval pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated.  There
 is coarsening of lung markings most notable in the region of the lingula and
 the periphery of the right upper lung and to a lesser extent the left upper
 lung.  Overall findings raise potential concern for an atypical infection and
 comparison with prior CT studies if available is recommended to assess for
 interval changes.  When compared with recent prior exam from 10 days ago,
 there is no significant change allowing for slight differences in technique. 
 There is mild blunting of the left CP angle which could reflect a tiny
 effusion versus pleural thickening.  No pneumothorax.  No congestion or edema.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with stable pattern of coarsened lung markings, most
 notable in the lingula, likely reflecting known atypical mycobacterial
 infection.  No acute findings compared with recent prior chest radiograph. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Nonemergent CT chest, if not all ready
 performed, would be helpful to further assess.
