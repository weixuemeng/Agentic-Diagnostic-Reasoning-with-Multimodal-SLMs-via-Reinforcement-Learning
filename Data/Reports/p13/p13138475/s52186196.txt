                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with Wegener's and history of post-obstructive
 pneumonia and now with increasing shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright view of the chest was obtained.  A left midline
 catheter, previously positioned within the left subclavian vein, now
 terminates at the junction of the left axillary and subclavian veins. 
 Allowing for positional differences, there has been no interval change in
 multifocal basilar-predominant consolidations.  Multiple superimposed
 bilateral ill-defined nodular opacities are similar to prior and may be
 related to known vasculitis.  Small right and moderate left pleural effusions
 are unchanged.  The heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Multifocal basilar-predominant consolidation and diffuse ill-defined
 nodular opacities, similar to prior study. Findings are compatible with
 multifocal pneumonia possibly coexisting with pulmonary hemorrhage in this
 patient with known vasculitis.  
 2.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusion are similar to prior.
 3.  Left midline catheter now terminates at the junction of the axillary and
 subclavian veins.
