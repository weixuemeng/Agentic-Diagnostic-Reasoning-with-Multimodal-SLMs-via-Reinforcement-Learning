                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of Wegener's
 granulomatosis, now with increasing dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Previously
 seen left-sided PICC is no longer identified and likely removed in the
 interval.  The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms,
 consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Left retrocardiac
 wedge-shaped opacification, slightly improved since the prior study, may be
 due to atelectasis/scarring.  Multiple known pulmonary nodules and chronic
 right middle lobe collapse, better evaluated on CT, although evidence of right
 middle lobe collapse is not clearly evident.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Degenerative changes are again seen along the spine.
