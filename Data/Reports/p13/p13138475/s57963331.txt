                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Wegeners
 granulomatosis, intubated.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed, with a focus on the lower lungs and
 upper abdomen.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  There is interval improvement of the
 mediastinal position, consistent with more central position of the heart and
 mediastinum as well as improvement of the left lung atelectasis, partially
 imaged.
