                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory failure, pneumonia cavity.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___,
 yesterday's CT scan.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left upper lobe and right lower lobe opacities have improved over a short
 period of time.  The other opacities are unchanged.  Left lower lobe collapse
 is stable.  Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  ET tube ends 5.3 cm above carina.  Left jugular line is at
 mid SVC.  NG tube is in the stomach.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Patient is known with complicated granulomatosis with polyangiitis. 
 Considering the fast improvement of left upper lobe and right lower lobe
 opacities, this could have been due to hemorrhage or aspiration rather than
 pneumonia.
 
 2.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.
