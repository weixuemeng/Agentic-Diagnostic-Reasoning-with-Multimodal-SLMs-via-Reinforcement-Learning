                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with COPD here with worsening  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The cardiac silhouette size appears moderately
 enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present with more pronounced right perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Additionally, more focal opacity within the right lung base could reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  There appears to be a small left
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present, however the medial aspects of
 the lung apices are somewhat obscured by overlying soft tissue structures.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, more pronounced on the right, with small left
 pleural effusion.  More focal patchy right basilar opacity could reflect
 atelectasis or pneumonia.
