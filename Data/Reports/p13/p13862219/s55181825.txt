                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with elevated lactate  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal increased interstitial
 opacities within the periphery and lung bases are perhaps minimally improved
 compared to the previous chest radiograph, and better assessed on the prior
 chest CT.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild chronic interstitial lung disease, better assessed on recent chest CT,
 and perhaps slightly improved from the previous chest radiograph.  No new
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
