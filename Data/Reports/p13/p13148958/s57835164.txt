                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intoxicated with hemoptysis  // Evaluate for
 findings suggestive of pulmonary TB      Evaluate for findings suggestive of
 pulmonary TB
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Please note that comparison to old studies can be helpful
 to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 20:35 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lung volumes are
 slightly diminished with patchy opacities at the bases likely reflecting
 atelectasis, although aspiration should also be considered.  Several small
 nodular opacities in the periphery of the right lung likely reflect prior
 granulomatous infection given their density.  Clinical correlation would be
 recommended.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  No large effusions.  If the
 patient's symptoms of hemoptysis persist, further imaging with dedicated chest
 CT may be indicated.
