                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 streaky linear opacities at the lung bases which are likely due to atelectasis
 with chronic changes.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Dual-lead left-sided
 pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected positions of the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  Chronic-appearing rib deformities on the right is again
 seen.
