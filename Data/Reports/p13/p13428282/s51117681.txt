                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Subtle bibasilar
 opacities likely are due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal, likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  Mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Subtle basilar opacities likely relate to atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes.
