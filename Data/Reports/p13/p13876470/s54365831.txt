                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pace maker implant. AP single view
 of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position.  Comparison
 is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___.  During the interval, the patient received a permanent pacer seen now in
 left anterior axillary position.  The pacer is connected to two intracavitary
 electrodes, one of them a ICD device terminating in a position compatible with
 the right ventricular apical portion.  Another electrode assumes a position on
 the frontal view compatible with introduction in the coronary sinus and
 termination in a marginal vein of the left ventricular lateral wall.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax on this portable chest examination.  More precise
 localization of electrodes will be possible on the followup PA and lateral
 chest examination.
