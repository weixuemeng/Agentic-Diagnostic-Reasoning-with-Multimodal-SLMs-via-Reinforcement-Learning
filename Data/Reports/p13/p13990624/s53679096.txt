                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with a cough, hypoxic, outside hospital
 transfer with report of white out, evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___ at 04:20.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is significant leftward rotation of the patient on current radiograph.
 Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged from same-day outside hospital chest radiograph. Extensive left lung
 opacification limits full evaluation of the cardiac silhouette, which appears
 normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary
 edema. Extensive consolidation with air bronchograms involving the majority of
 the left lung is concerning for pneumonia. More ill-defined reticular
 opacities within the right lower lung may reflect sequela of aspiration or
 pneumonia. Underlying emphysema is suspected. There is no right pleural
 effusion. There is likely at least a moderate left pleural effusion.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive left lung opacification concerning for pneumonia.  Right lower lung
 reticular opacities may reflect aspiration or pneumonia. Probable moderate
 left pleural effusion. Recommend followup to resolution.
