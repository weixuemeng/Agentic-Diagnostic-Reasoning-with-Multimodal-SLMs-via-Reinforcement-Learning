 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 11:57 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Generalized improvement in background lung density concurrent with mild
 decrease in heart size suggests improvement in the component of pulmonary
 edema, but considerable abnormality remains, particular bibasilar
 consolidation due to infection or hemorrhage.  Left pleural effusion is
 probably moderate in size, unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 ET tube is in standard placement, transesophageal drainage tube passes into
 the stomach and out of view.  Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
