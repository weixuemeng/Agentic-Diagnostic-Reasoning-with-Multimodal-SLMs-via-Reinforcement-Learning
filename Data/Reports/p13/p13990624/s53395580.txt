                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated with pneumonia  // Interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, diffuse am, heterogeneous
 bilateral pulmonary opacities are mostly similar except for worsening in the
 right lower lung. Poorly defined nodular opacities are present with apparent
 cavitation. Findings are consistent with multifocal infection. In the setting
 of cavitation, septic emboli and granulomatous infection should be considered.
