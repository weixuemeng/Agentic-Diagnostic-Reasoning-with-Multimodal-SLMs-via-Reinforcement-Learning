                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LLL PNA - intubated  // eval for ETT
 placement      eval for ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this day, there has been placement of
 an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.
 Nasogastric tube is in the stomach, though the side hole is probably just
 proximal to the esophagogastric junction. Otherwise little change.
