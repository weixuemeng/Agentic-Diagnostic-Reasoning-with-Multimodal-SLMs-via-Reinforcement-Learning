                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  History of coronary artery disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The aorta is calcified with
 mild unfolding.  The heart appears normal in size.  The lungs are clear. 
 Blunting of each costophrenic sulcus is noted which makes tiny effusions
 possible, although the appearance may be due to scarring and does not appear
 changed.  Right apical scarring with calcification appears similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute disease.  Blunting of costophrenic sulci,
 probably due to background scarring, although very small pleural effusions are
 not exluded.
