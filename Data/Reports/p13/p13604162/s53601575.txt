                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:53 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with possible aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:53 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip
 projecting over the stomach. Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  A face mask
 obscures the lung apices.  The heart remains enlarged likely reflecting
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is a mild prominence of the perihilar vasculature with no evidence of
 overt pulmonary edema.  Subtle increasing retrocardiac opacity may reflect an
 area of atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Followup imaging may be helpful.  No pleural effusions.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
