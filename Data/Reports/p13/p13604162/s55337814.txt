                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:08 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with ischemic bowel.  Intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 It is difficult to distinguish whether changes in the opacity of the left mid
 and lower lung zone, worsened between ___, minimally improved today
 is due to intrinsic changes in the lung or pleural effusion layering with
 differences in patient position.  Consistently upright views are recommended
 for purposes of serial comparison.  If more definitive discrimination between
 lung and pleural findings is needed, then CT scanning would need to be
 performed.
 
 There has clearly been a decrease in mediastinal venous caliber and heart size
 reflecting decrease in volume overload.  The right lung is entirely clear.  ET
 tube in standard placement.  There appear to be three catheters extending into
 the stomach.  Feeding tube probably goes to the third or fourth portion of the
 duodenum.  The other two end in the upper stomach.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
