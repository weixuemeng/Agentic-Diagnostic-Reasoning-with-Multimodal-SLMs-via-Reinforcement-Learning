                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, intubated.  Check fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.  An
 esophageal drain terminates in the mid portion of a non-distended stomach.  An
 enteric feeding tube is likely post pyloric, tip is not included in this
 examination.  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. 
 Lung volumes remain low and there is persistent retrocardiac and left lung
 base opacity likely related to atelectasis and pleural fluid. No large
 pneumothorax. No definite pulmonary edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent retrocardiac and left base opacity likely reflective of
 a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
