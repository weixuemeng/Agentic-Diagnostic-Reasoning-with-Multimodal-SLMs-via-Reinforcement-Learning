                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the Dobbhoff
 tube extends at least to the second portion of the duodenum where it crosses
 the lower margin of the image.  Otherwise, little change in the appearance of
 the heart and lungs and other monitoring and support devices.
