                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's overlying arm partially obscures the anterior hemithorax on the
 lateral view.  Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  The hilar contours are stable.  There has been interval removal of a
 previously seen right-sided PICC.  There is heterogeneity of the partially
 imaged proximal left humeral shaft with a small focus of lucency seen.  Please
 see dedicated imaging of the left humerus performed concurrently.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
