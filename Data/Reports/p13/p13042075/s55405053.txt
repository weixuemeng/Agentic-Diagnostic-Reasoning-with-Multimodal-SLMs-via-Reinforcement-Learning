                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate interval change in pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a small amount
 of pleural fluid tracking into the right major and minor fissures.  Multifocal
 consolidations have improved from ___, but some residual opacities,
 particularly in the right upper lobe, persist.  A possible left upper lobe
 nodular opacity also remains.  Bilateral, right greater than left apical
 pleural thickening is seen.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval improvement in, but persistence of multifocal consolidations. 
 Possible pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe.  Unless there is a good
 understanding of the pulmonary process occurring in this patient, a CT is
 recommended for further evaluation. 
 
 2. Residual small right pleural effusion, mainly tracking into the right major
 and minor fissures.
