  Accounting for differences in technique, there is no change in the mediastinum
  from ___.  Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
  pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Hyperlucency seen at the left
  lung base may represent a dilated loop of bowel as seen on the recent
  abdominal radiograph.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to the back, evaluation for widened
 mediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 6:03 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change
 in appearance of the mediastinum.  No leftward or rightward mediastinum
 widening or blunting of mediastinal contours is visible.  There is no evidence
 of apical cap or other pathological fluid collections.  Contour of the aortic
 knob and the descending aorta are unremarkable.  In unchanged manner, there is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with atelectatic changes at the right
 lung bases.  The alignment of the sternal wires is constant in appearance.
 
 However, if aortic pathology is suspected based on the clinical situation, CTA
 of the chest should be performed, given the higher sensitivity to detect
 subtle or subacute changes.
