                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is again seen.  Surgical chain sutures projecting over the right lung and
 hilum and changes at the posterior right ribs are again seen and suggestive of
 prior lobectomy.  The left lung remains clear.  Blunting of the left posterior
 costophrenic angle is compatible with a Bochdalek hernia identified on recent
 CT scan.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in configuration.  Median
 sternotomy wires are again seen, the top 2 of which are fractured.  Surgical
 hardware is seen in the left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable appearance of the chest without acute cardiopulmonary process.
