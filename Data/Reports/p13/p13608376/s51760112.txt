                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Evaluate for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume, but clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  Nodular bilateral hilar opacities correspond to
 pulmonary vessels on chest CTA from ___.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present. Fractured sternal wires are longstanding and there has been no
 further derangement of the wires since at least ___.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged and may date from extensive trauma to the right
 chest responsible for healed rib fractures and extensive pleural thickening. 
 Surgical anchors are noted overlying the left humerus.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute intrathoracic process. Stable changes of remote chest trauma and
 disrupted sternal wires.
