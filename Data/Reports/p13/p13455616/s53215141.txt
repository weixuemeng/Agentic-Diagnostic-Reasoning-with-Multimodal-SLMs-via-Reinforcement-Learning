                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p tv repair, MV repair, AVR, s/p TV
 repair, AVR ? PA line position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 15:35.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly withdrawn, but
 it still ends in the proximal left pulmonary artery.  The patient has had
 recent sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. Sternotomy wires are intact
 and aligned. The side port of the enteric tube sits at the GE junction.
 Advancement by at least 5 cm should be considered for more optimal positioning
 within the stomach. Remaining support devices, including an ET tube and
 mediastinal drain remain in satisfactory position.
 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly despite the
 projection is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter, which terminates in the left
 pulmonary artery.
 
 Side port of enteric tube is at GE junction. Advancement by at least 5 cm
 should be considered for more optimal positioning within the stomach. All
 remaining support devices in satisfactory position.
 
 Clear lungs.
 
 Stable cardiomegaly.
