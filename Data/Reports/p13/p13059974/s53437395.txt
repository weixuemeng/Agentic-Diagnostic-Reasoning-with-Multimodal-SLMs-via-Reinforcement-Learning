                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever, cough and neck pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 within normal limits allowing for lung volumes.  There is no free air under
 the diaphragm.  Degenerative changes are seen in the shoulder girdles
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
