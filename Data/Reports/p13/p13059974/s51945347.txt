 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low resulting in mild

 chronic mild edema or underlying chronic lung disease.  No superimposed
 confluent consolidation is identified.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
 is chronic.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process
