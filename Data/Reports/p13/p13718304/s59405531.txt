                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study which accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinal widening is re- demonstrated, potentially due to the presence of
 mediastinal fat and low lung volumes.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aortic knob are present.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Small hiatal hernia persists.  Apart from
 atelectasis at the lung bases, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized
 with moderate degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
