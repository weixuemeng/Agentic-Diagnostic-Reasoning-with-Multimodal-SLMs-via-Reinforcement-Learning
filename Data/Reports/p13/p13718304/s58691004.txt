                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent significant drop in
 hematocrit, new acute onset CHF, unable to tolerate endoscopies.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Cardiac enlargement as before.  Again
 calcifications are identified within the aortic valve area on the lateral
 view.  Overall, heart size has not changed significantly; however, the
 pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has improved markedly.  The degree of
 pleural effusions has regressed significantly with only some mild blunting of
 the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remaining.  No evidence of new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax
 in the apical areas.  Similar as identified on the previous examination, there
 is a rounded approximately 2 cm diameter density in the right supra-apical
 soft tissue area which possibly may represent an enlarged lymph node or
 external skin lesion.  It is remote from the pleural space and lung tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Significant improvement of previously identified acute pulmonary
 CHF pattern.
