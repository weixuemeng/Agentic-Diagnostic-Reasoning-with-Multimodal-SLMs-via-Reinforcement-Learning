                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath, evaluate for
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart is markedly enlarged.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities are identified, however, on the lateral view, suspected aortic
 valve calcifications are seen.  In addition, some calcium deposits are also
 seen in the wall of the aorta.  The pulmonary vasculature is congested with
 perivascular haze and beginning central edema.  Mild blunting of the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses is also noted.  There is no evidence of
 additional discrete local parenchymal infiltrates, which would be suggestive
 of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area.  Skeletal
 structures demonstrates rather marked demineralization of the vertebral bodies
 of the thoracic spine with accentuated kyphotic curvature, but no conclusive
 evidence of local vertebral body compression fracture.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiac enlargement indicative of left-sided CHF with
 pulmonary congestion close to central pulmonary edema.  Calcium deposits in
 the aortic valve area suggest aortic stenosis as the course.  Referring
 physician, ___. ___ was paged at 3:05 p.m.
