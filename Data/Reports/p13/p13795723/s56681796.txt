                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, COPD, evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, potentially showing improved ventilation.  There is unchanged
 evidence of minimal calcified granuloma at the right and left lung apex.
 
 Also unchanged are areas of atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 At the left lung base, however, better seen on the lateral than on the frontal
 radiograph, a triangular shaped parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms is
 visible.  On the frontal radiograph, this opacity is projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette.  The morphology of the opacity would be suspicious for
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta, moderate calcifications of the aortic arch.  No pulmonary
 edema.
 
 The observation was made at 1:28 p.m., on ___, at the same time point
 the referring physician, ___. ___, was paged for notification and the
 findings were subsequently discussed over the telephone.
