                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Clinical suspicion for congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate cardiac silhouette enlargement persists.  There is dense
 atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob.  Low lung volumes are
 present, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted similar in extent
 compared to the previous exam.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions have
 slightly decreased in size compared to the prior exam.  Streaky opacities in
 the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions,
 improved compared to the previous exam.
