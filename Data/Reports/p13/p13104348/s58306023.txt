 calcified.  Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with
 mild pulmonary edema.  Small left and small to moderate size right bilateral
 pleural effusions are demonstrated.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  S-shaped thoracolumbar
 scoliosis is present.

 Mild pulmonary edema, small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
