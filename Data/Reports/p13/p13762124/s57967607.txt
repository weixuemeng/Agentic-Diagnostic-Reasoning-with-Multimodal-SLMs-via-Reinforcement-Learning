                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the central catheters and
 nasogastric tube remain in position.  There are slightly lower lung volumes. 
 The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  Some poor definition of
 pulmonary markings could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 There is increased opacification at the left base.  Although this could merely
 reflect atelectatic changes or even chronic pulmonary disease, the possibility
 of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
