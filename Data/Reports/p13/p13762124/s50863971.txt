                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the initial radiograph, a feeding tube was coiled within the
 proximal thoracic esophagus, with tip directed cephalad, outside of the field
 of view.  On the second radiograph, the feeding tube has been removed.  On the
 third radiograph, a nasogastric tube is in place, with tip terminating within
 the stomach.  Endotracheal tube and vascular sheath are in standard position
 on all three radiographs, and the appearances of the lungs and pleura are not
 appreciably changed since the recent study of earlier the same date.
