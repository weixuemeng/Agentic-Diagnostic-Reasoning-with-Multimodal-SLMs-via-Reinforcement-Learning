                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia and congestive heart failure, here to evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is advanced from
 the prior study with the tip now terminating at the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.  Anterior cervical spine fixation hardware is unchanged.  Multiple
 coronary arterial stents are redemonstrated.  There are increased bilateral
 lung opacities most pronounced at the bilateral lung bases from the most
 recent prior study.  There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated
 due to bibasilar opacities.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased bilateral opacities most consistent with ARDS although a
 component of pulmonary edema and/or superimposed infection is not excluded.
 2.  Increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion from ___.
 3.  Interval advancement of right IJ catheter with tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.
