                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CHF, shortness of breath,
 pulmonary edema, hypoxia, evaluate for worsening of pulmonary edema, ? ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 examination obtained two hours earlier during the same day.  The extensive
 bilateral multifocal patchy and confluenting parenchymal densities are similar
 to what has been described on the preceding examination.  Comparison with
 findings on examination of ___ demonstrates progression of the
 patchy infiltrates.  There is also blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses
 indicating at least moderate amount of pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 found.  When comparison is extended to the next previous available chest
 examination of ___, there existed only small regional basal
 parenchymal densities mostly on the left side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Advanced bilateral pulmonary opacities most likely related to
 aggressive infectious process.  Pulmonary vascularity cannot be assessed as
 they are overshadowed by the infiltrates.  As previously commented,
 significant cardiac enlargement cannot be identified on these portable chest
 examinations.
