                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 802 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ARDS, any interval change?
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 802 is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular introducer
 are unchanged.  A left PICC line terminates in the left axilla, unchanged. 
 Several tubular structures are seen overlying the heart possibly representing
 calcificed coronary arteries or stents.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to an interval
 worsening of the bilateral airspace process which likely reflects pulmonary
 edema superimposed on underlying ARDS.
