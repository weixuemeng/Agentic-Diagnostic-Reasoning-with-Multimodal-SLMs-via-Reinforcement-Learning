 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Back pain, evaluation for apical scarring.  Questionable Potts'
 disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  No evidence of apical scarring.  Atelectasis at the right lung
 bases seen on both the frontal and the lateral view.  No pleural effusion.  No
 radiographic evidence of Pott's disease, but a radiograph of the spine might
 be more appropriate to evaluate this disease.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Normal size and appearance of the mediastinum and hilar structures.
