 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ST elevation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline enlarged with a relatively rounded contour.
 There is moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The aortic arch appears
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the
 limitations of technique.  There are small pleural effusions, probably greater
 on the left than right, with patchy lower lung opacities likely attributable
 to associated atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-severe
 leftward convex curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline cardiomegaly and small pleural effusions, although
 without frank congestive heart failure.  Patchy lower lung opacities are not
 entirely specific, but are compatible with atelectasis associated with pleural
 effusions.
 
 Although there is no specific indication for pericardial effusion, the rounded
 appearance of the cardiac contour could potentially be seen with a pericardial
 effusion if that is a clinical concern.
