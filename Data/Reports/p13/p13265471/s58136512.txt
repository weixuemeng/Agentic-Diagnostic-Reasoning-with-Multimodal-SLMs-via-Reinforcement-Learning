                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fulminant hepatitis, hypoglycemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is similar in size compared to the prior study
 with associated right basilar opacity, which may reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  There is minimal streaky left basilar atelectasis.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is improved compared to the previous study. No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate to large right pleural effusion with right basilar
 opacity, likely compressive atelectasis.  Minimal streaky left basilar
 atelectasis.  Improving mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
