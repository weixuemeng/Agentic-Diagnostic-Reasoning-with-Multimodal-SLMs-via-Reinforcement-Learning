                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 perihilar opacities which may be due to mild edema; however, resolving
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  The opacities
 are decreased as compared to the prior study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
