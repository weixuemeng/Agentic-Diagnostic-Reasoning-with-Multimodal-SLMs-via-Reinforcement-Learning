                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema.  New more confluent
 opacities have developed in the right upper and both lower lungs, and may
 reflect asymmetrical edema, multifocal aspiration, or rapidly developing
 pneumonia.  Additional linear areas of atelectasis are noted in both lung
 bases.  No visible pneumothorax.
