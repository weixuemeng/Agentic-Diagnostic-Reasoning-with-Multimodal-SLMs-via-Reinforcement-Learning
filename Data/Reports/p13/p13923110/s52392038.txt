                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Free air in the abdomen on CT, here to evaluate for evidence of
 free air beneath the diaphragm.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph performed at___ earlier the
 same day and CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are low.  The lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is accentuated due to low lung volumes.  There is resultant
 bronchovascular crowding, but no overt pulmonary edema.  No evidence of free
 air beneath the diaphragms is seen. Residual contrast is seen in the renal
 collecting systems which appears dilated on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
 3.  Low lung volumes.
 3.  Residual contrast is seen in the renal collecting systems which appears
 dilated on the right.  Trend creatinine.
