                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiomegaly or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest was obtained.  The
 lungs are normally expanded and clear.  There is no focal airspace
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A small ossific
 density projecting just above the right AC joint may be dystrophic.  Round
 radiopaque metallic density projects just superior to the right clavicle,
 potentially within or superficial to the soft tissues.
