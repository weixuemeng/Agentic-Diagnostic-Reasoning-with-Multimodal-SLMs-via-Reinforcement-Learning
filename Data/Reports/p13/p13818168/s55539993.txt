  Dedicated chest CT or shallow oblique radiographs could obtained for further
  evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypotension, fever, evaluate for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rounded opacities in the right midlung are new from the prior study and may
 represent new pulmonary nodules.  Findings may be mildly accentuated by
 overlapping ribs, however these are unlikely to be purely artifactual,
 external artifact/ skin lesion is possible.  The previously seen pulmonary
 nodules in the left lung base are not appreciated.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural, pulmonary, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  The osseous structures and upper abdomen are
 unremarkable
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right midlung rounded opacities are worrisome for new pulmonary nodules. 
 Recommend shallow obliques radiographs for further assessment or chest CT.
 2. No focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated chest CT or shallow oblique radiographs could be
 obtained for further evaluation of new right midlung opacities.
