                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB, hypoxia  // eval for pneumonia, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable mild cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.  There is
 right-greater-than-left perihilar engorgement, more than seen on the prior
 study, with vascular crowding in the right cardiophrenic region and minimal
 atelectasis at the right-greater-than-left bases.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution. No interstitial edema. No definite pleural
 effusion.  No frank consolidation.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is a 3.3 mm calcified granuloma at the left base.
 
 Compared with ___, the PICC line has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is probably not significantly changed
 
 Suspect vascular plethora, with upper zone redistribution and engorgement of
 the perihilar vessels.  However, there is no interstitial edema.
 
 Right base atelectasis, with crowding of vessels in the right infrahilar
 region.  The possibility of an early infectious infiltrate in this area cannot
 be entirely excluded.  Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate is identified.
