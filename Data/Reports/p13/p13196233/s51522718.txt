                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML and progressive cough  // Eval cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a right subclavian central line with tip over proximal SVC. No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low. Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged.
 Apparent upper zone redistribution is likely accentuated by low inspiratory
 volumes. Doubt CHF.
 
 There is patchy opacity at the right base medially and minimal atelectasis at
 the left base. Appearances at the right base are more pronounced than on ___ and raise the possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate. The right
 hilum also appears somewhat more prominent on today's exam. No effusions
 identified. Right hemidiaphragm slightly elevated.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Patchy opacity at the right base with prominence of the inferior right hilum,
 more pronounced than on ___. Although this could be accentuated
 by low inspiratory volumes, the possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate
 cannot be excluded.
