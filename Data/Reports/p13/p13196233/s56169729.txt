 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Areas

 retrocardiac region. This could merely reflect some atelectatic changes and
 crowding of vessels, though in the appropriate clinical setting the
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia could be considered.  Central catheter
 is essentially unchanged.
