                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are underinflated.
 
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion.  There also appears to
 be a trace left pleural effusion.  Patchy, ill-defined opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis or infection.  There is possible mild pulmonary
 vasculature congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with patchy, ill-defined opacities in the lung bases which
 may reflect atelectasis or infection in the correct clinical setting.  Follow
 up radiographs with better inspiratory effort may provide better evaluation of
 the lung bases.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusion,
 larger on the right.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up radiographs with improved inspiratory effort may
 provide better evaluation of the lung bases.
