                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DOE, neg ETT  // assess for
 infiltrate/mass      DOE NEG ETT ASSESS FOR INFILTRATE/MASS
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray 0 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient has had left mastectomy.
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is slightly larger but
 pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Contour of the right hilus has changed
 ; it is more bulbous inferiorly, and it is slightly larger than before.  This
 could be due to dilated pulmonary artery, or alternatively a small mass. 
 Chest CT scanning, with intravenous contrast, would be definitive.  If for
 some reason the patient's renal function does not permit use of intravenous
 contrast agent I would recommend a noncontrast MRI all as an alternative.
