                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia and decreased responsiveness.  // why
 is pt hypoxic
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest x-ray from ___ was obtained as a
 outpatient hard copy film and not available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 On the current study, there is evidence for background COPD.  There is
 probable mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 There are patchy interstitial alveolar opacities which or most pronounced in
 both upper zones, extending from the suprahilar region this superiorly.  There
 is minimal patchy opacity at the right and left bases peripherally.  On the
 right, this extends to the infrahilar region.  There is slight blunting of
 both costophrenic angles, but no gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 A rounded density overlying the right lung apex medially is noted, but may
 represent artifact due to overlying soft tissues.  Attention to this area on
 followup films is recommended.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly.
 2. Likely background COPD.
 3. Abnormal opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the mid and upper
 zones.  These are of indeterminate chronicity, with an extensive differential.
 The differential includes infectious and inflammatory infiltrates as well as
 changes due to a chronic fibrotic process.  Aspiration is also in the
 differential.  This could also represent an atypical distribution of CHF,
 though that is considered less likely.  An atypical presentation of neoplastic
 process is also considered less likely, but cannot be entirely excluded.
 4. Rounded density right lung apex medially--___ artifact due to
 overlying soft tissues.  Attention to this area on followup films is
 recommended.
