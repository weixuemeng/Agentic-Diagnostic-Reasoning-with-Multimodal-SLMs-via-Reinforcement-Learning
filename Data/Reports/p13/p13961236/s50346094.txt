                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post pacer placement, now with elevated INR
 and swelling.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an apparent increase in soft tissue density in the left
 axilla compared with the prior study.  The left chest single-lead pacemaker
 remains in place, with its lead positioned at the level of the ventricles. 
 There is left basilar opacity.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  Note is made of mitral annular
 calcifications. The mediastinal contours are notable for calcification of the
 aortic arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basal opacity, likely atelectasis, cannot exclude pneumonia.
 
 2.  Apparent increase in soft tissue in the left axilla.
