                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for worsening venous congestion or effusion.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 Lung volumes remain low.  Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The large
 left pleural is larger, layering along the left lateral chest wall.  The
 moderate right pleural effusion is minimally increased.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is worse.  Mild pulmonary congestion is not appreciably changed.  A new right
 PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.  A left pacer lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.  There is no  pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left pleural effusion is increased, and moderate right pleural
 effusion is minimally increased.  
 
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis is worse and mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
