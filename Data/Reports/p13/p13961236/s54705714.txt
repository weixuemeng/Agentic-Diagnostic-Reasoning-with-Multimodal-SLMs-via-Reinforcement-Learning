                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with low-grade temperature, pacer pocket
 hematoma, left basilar consolidation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.  Aeration of
 the left base has minimally improved since the prior exam two days ago.  A
 left basilar retrocardiac opacity continues to obscure the left hemidiaphragm.
 No new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  Soft tissue
 density surrounding a left chest pacer corresponds with the clinically noted
 pacer pocket hematoma.  A single cardiac lead projects over the right
 ventricle.  Cardiomegaly remains mild.  The aortic arch and mitral valve
 anulus are calcified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal improvement in left basilar aeration.  Persistant left lower lobe
 opacity can represent both atelectasis or pneumonia; this differentiation
 cannot be made on this exam.
 
 2.  Left chest soft tissue density corresponds with known pacer pocket
 hematoma.
