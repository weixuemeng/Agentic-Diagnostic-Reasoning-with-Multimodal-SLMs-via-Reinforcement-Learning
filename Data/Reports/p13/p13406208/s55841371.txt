  1. Left upper lung linear opacity may represent lingering/residual pneumonia
  or an area of bronchiectatic inflammation - reimaging after treatment may be
  considered.
  2. Increase in right lower lung nodule size; reimaging with nipple markers may
  be considered.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest tightness.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 show an area of linear density in the left upper lung which correlates to an
 area of consolidation on ___ CT.  The nodular density projecting over the
 left hemidiaphragm likely represents a nipple shadow and was seen on prior
 exam; the nodular density over the right hemidiaphragm correlates to a nodule
 seen on ___ CT and has increased in size.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Left upper lung linear opacity may represent lingering/residual pneumonia
 or an area of bronchiectatic inflammation - reimaging after treatment may be
 considered.
 2. Increase in right lower lung nodule size; reimaging with nipple markers may
 be considered.
