                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Inability to swallow, weight loss.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 Projecting over the right lower lung, is a 1.1 cm ovoid opacity which may
 represent a nipple shadow, which can be confirmed with repeat with nipple
 markers.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 Prominence of the trachea right above the level of the clavicles is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflated lungs may relate to COPD.  1.1 cm ovoid opacity
 projecting over the right lower lung field may relate to a nipple shadow, but
 which should be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.
