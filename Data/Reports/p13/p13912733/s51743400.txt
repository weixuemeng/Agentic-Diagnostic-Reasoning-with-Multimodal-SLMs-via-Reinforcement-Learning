 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval intubation with tip of tube terminating 4 cm above the
 carina.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present, as well as new patchy and linear bibasilar lung
 opacities, left greater than right.  These findings may be due to atelectasis
 and/or aspiration.  Small left pleural effusion is new.  No visible
 pneumothorax.
