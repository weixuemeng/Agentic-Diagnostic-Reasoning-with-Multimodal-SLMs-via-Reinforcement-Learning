                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with gi bleed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with aortic knob
 calcifications. Right infrahilar opacity is also again noted, slightly less
 dense than on the most recent prior study, which may represent scarring. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The lungs are well expanded
 without focal consolidation. Two punctate opacities projecting over the right
 apex are consistent with calcified granuloma.  The upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
