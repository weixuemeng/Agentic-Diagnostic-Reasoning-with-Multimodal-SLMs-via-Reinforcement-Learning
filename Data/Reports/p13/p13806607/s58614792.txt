                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Patchy opacity
 affects the medial anterior right middle lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest pneumonia in the right middle lobe.  If impression of
 pneumonia is discordant with clinical presentation, then correlation with
 whether there may have been any recent pulmonary infection is recommended; the
 area of opacification is not typical of atelectasis or mass lesion. 
 Correlation with any prior outside radiographs may also be helpful.  Follow-up
 radiographs are recommended to show resolution in ___ weeks.
