                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:25 P.M., ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis, elevated white count and
 ascites.  Evaluate port placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 A left-sided central venous line ends in the low SVC.  Right lung is clear and
 right pleural surfaces are normal.  On the left the elevation of the lateral
 aspect of the lung base is most readily explained by subpulmonic pleural
 effusion which probably explains greater left infrahilar opacification.  A
 lateral view would be helpful to exclude left lower lobe pneumonia.  The upper
 lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal and mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.
