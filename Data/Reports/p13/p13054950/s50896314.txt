                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 could indicate trace effusion.  No pulmonary edema is seen.  Increased AP
 diameter of the chest is suggestive of COPD.  There is moderate cardiomegaly
 and calcification of the aortic arch.  No displaced fracture is identified.
