                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Orogastric tube terminates in the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, and makes an abrupt curve approximately 4 cm proximal to the tip. 
 The sharpness of the curve favors location within the distal stomach over the
 C-loop of the duodenum.  Within the chest, there is stable cardiomegaly and
 persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
