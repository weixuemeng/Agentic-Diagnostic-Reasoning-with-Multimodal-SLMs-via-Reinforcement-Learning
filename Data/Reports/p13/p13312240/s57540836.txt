 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a

 Sternal wires are in unchanged correct alignment.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 without pulmonary edema.  Presence of minimal bilateral pleural effusions
 cannot be excluded.  The left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged.
