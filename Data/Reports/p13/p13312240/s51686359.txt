                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with EVAR, evaluate for pneumothorax,
 check ETT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding supine
 chest examination of ___.  The patient is now intubated and ETT is
 seen to terminate in the trachea 5.5 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular approach central venous line is present and terminates
 overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at the level of the carina. 
 As before, there is status post sternotomy, previous bypass surgery with at
 least two circular metallic graft indicators noted at the anterior surface of
 the ascending aorta.  An ICD device is located in left anterior axillary
 position and the single intracavitary electrode terminates in the distal
 apical portion of the right ventricle.  All these findings are unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax has developed in conjunction with the intubation and central
 venous line placement.
