                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is minimal left lower lung atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Ovoid opacities overlying both
 lung bases on the frontal projection correspond to the patient's nipples and
 should not be confused with pulmonary nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
