                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with C diff colitis with new NG tube placed  //
 confirm gastric placement      confirm gastric placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 23:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two sequential portable AP upright chest films ___ at 17 12 are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a new nasogastric tube which courses
 below the diaphragm and the tip projecting over the stomach.  There is
 persistent opacity at the right base which likely reflects a combination of
 pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis of the lower and middle lobes.
 In addition, there is increasing opacification in the retrocardiac region
 which could reflect left lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot
 be entirely excluded and therefore clinical correlation is recommended.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax. Bilateral calcified saline breast implants.
