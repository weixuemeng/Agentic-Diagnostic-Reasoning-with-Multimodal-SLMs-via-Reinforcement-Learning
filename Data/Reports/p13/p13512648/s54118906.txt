                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Recent sepsis, with C. difficile colitis, presenting with acute
 dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral calcified breast implants are present.  The heart is normal in size.
 Perihilar opacity on the right is somewhat striking although not particularly
 mass-like.  This may represent an inflammatory process or atelectasis along
 the right hilum.  More generally, at both lung bases, there are vague
 opacities which may represent atelectasis.  Mid upper lung zones, however, are
 unremarkable.  The stomach is mildly distended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Basilar opacities which may represent of atelectasis; pleural effusions are
 difficult to exclude.  Right perihilar opacity is also suspected.  When
 clinically feasible, reassessment with standard PA and lateral radiography is
 recommended in order to reassess.
