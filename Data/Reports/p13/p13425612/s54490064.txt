                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p AVR  // eval for effusion or
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, there is little overall
 change.  Lung volumes remain low.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with
 adjacent mild left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, stable.  Probable
 trace right pleural effusion is stable.  No new focal consolidation.  No
 pneumothorax.   Moderate cardiomegaly, though difficult to assess the presence
 of effusion, is likely stable.  The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded and
 tortuous, as before.
 
 Right PICC line tip terminates in the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated left
 basilar atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation.
 2. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
