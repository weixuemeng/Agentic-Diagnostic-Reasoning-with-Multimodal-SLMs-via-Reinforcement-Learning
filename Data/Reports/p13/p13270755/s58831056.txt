                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman f/u pna  // ? pna resolution
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, a left lower lobe opacity has partially cleared.  Poorly
 defined subcentimeter nodular opacities are also demonstrated at approximately
 the level of the fifth anterior rib bilaterally, possibly due to nipple
 shadows but not definitively localized.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for a
 focal area of peripheral scarring at the right base and relatively symmetrical
 mild biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring.  Heart size is normal, and
 there is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is no
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Partial clearing of left lower lobe opacities likely due to resolving
 pneumonia.  Poorly defined nodular opacities potentially represent nipple
 shadows.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:
 
 Recommend additional followup chest radiograph in 4 weeks to document complete
 clearance of left lower lobe abnormality.  Please order the followup
 radiograph with nipple markers to allow reassessment of the subcentimeter
 nodular opacities described above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:35 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
