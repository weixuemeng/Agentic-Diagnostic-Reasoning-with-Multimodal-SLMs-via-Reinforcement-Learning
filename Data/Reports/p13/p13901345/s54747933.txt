                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post repair of left atrial
 perforation, evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest
 examination of ___.  There is status post sternotomy as before. 
 Cardiac size cannot be assessed because of overlying pleural densities but
 probably unchanged.  The on previous examination described bilateral pleural
 densities persist and apparently have even progressed on the right side.  No
 new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen and the pulmonary congestive
 pattern has not increased.  The lateral view permits assessment of pleural
 effusion which apparently is mild to moderate, apparently slightly more marked
 on the left side than the right.  Paying attention to that, the patient was in
 rather recumbent position on the preceding portable chest examination and now
 in upright position the somewhat different appearance of the pleural densities
 can be ascribed to the positional changes of the patient during the interval. 
 Grossly amount of pleural effusions appear to be stable.  Observed that there
 is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and no pneumothorax can be
 identified.  Dr. ___ was paged at ___ at 3:45 p.m.
