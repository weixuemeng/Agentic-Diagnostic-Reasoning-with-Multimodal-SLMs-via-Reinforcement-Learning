                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:   Dressler's syndrome, bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial
 effusion, thoracocentesis, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina.  Left subclavian line is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  A pericardial catheter starts above the left lower
 cardiac silhouette which looks smaller than previous exam.  Right pleural
 effusion has reaccumulated with right apical loculation.  Persistent and
 increasing right lung consolidation, most prominent in the right lower lobe is
 worrisome for pneumonia.  It could partly be explained by pulmonary edema too.
 Left moderate pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Cardiac silhouette has improved after pericardiocentesis.
 3.  Right pleural fluid has reaccumulated.
 4.  Persistent and increasing right lung consolidation is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  This was discussed with the medical team.
