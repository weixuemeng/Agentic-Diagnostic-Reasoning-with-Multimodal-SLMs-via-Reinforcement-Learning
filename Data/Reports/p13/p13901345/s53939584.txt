                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/status post
 ablation complicated by left atrial perforation, post open repair on
 ___, now with one month of progressive shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A left subclavian central venous catheter ends in the lower SVC. 
 Bilateral large pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis of
 both lung bases have slightly worsened since the prior study.  The remainder
 of the aerated lung appears unremarkable except for mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due
 to the large effusions. Multiple intact sternotomy wires are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increase in the large bilateral effusions and compressive
 bibasilar atelectasis.
