 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:49 PM
  interval removal of right pleural effusion, with only a small residual pleural
  effusoin on the right. stable large left effusion. Dense opacification in now
  visible right lower lung likley represents atelectasis, though infection not
  excluded. hyperlucent region along base of right lung may represent trapped
  normally aerated lung, but cannot exclude small subpulmonic pneumothorax.
  medistinum is unchanged. suggest continued radiographic surveillance. ___

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post thoracentesis.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  There has been almost
 complete resolution of right pleural effusion.  Opacities in the right lower
 lobe are most likely due to re-expansion pulmonary edema.  Cardiac size cannot
 be evaluated.  Large left pleural effusion is stable.  Sternal wires are
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
