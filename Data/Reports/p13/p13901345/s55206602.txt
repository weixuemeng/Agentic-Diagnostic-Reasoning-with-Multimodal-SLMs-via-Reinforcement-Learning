   in confirmed upright portable CXR, previously noted area of luncency
  projecting along right lung base is less evident and likely reflected aerated

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post thoracentesis, patient with decreased
 oxygenation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier.
 
 There has been interval worsening of right middle and right lower lobe
 opacities consistent with worsening re-expansion pulmonary edema.  There is
 probably a tiny right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Large left
 effusion is stable.
