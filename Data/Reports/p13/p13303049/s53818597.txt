                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for fracture in the left side, the patient with left
 elbow fracture.
 
 There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is tortuous. There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of rib fractures.  Of
 note, this examination was not tailored for evaluation of osseous structures
 and with clinically persistent concern, dedicated rib series can be performed.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Partially evaluated hardware material in the left humerus .
