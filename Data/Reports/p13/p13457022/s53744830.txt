                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected atelectasis due to shortness of breath.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  Minimal
 atelectasis at the left lower lung is noted, new, reason unclear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basal new atelectasis.  In the absence of appreciable reason for
 atelectasis, assessment with chest CT might be considered to exclude the
 possibility of obstruction.  Alternatively, atelectasis due to elevation of
 left hemidiaphragm might be a possibility as there is a known reason for left
 hemidiaphragm elevation.
