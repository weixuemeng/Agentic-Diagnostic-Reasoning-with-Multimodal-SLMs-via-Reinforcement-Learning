                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pulmonary fibrosis with worsening hypoxia, assess for
 failure or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  There is
 diffuse ground-glass opacity which is concerning for pulmonary edema
 superimposed on the background of pulmonary fibrosis.  Hilar congestion is
 also noted.  No pneumothorax.  Evaluation for effusion or subtle pneumonia is
 limited.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pulmonary edema superimposed on known
 background of interstitial fibrosis. Please refer to subsequent CT chest for
 further details.
