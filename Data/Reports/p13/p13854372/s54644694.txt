 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There are coarse bilateral diffuse opacities,
 unchanged from the prior examination, consistent with the patient's history of

 are obscured by the diffuse interstitial markings, but unchanged from prior
 examinations.  Pulmonary edema is present.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces are appreciated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable diffuse radiopacities consistent with known interstitial
 lung disease as well as increased pulmonary edema from the prior examination.
