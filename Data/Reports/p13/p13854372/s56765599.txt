                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxia and fall.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CTA chest of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Extensive bilateral interstitial abnormality, largel
 pulmonary fibrosis, has worsened over six months, which can be due either to
 worsening of the fibrosis or concurrent pulmonary edema. The hila and
 mediastinal vasculature and the moderate cardiomegaly are more pronounced,
 which can be explained either by biventricular or progressive right heart
 failure.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax or detectable hemothorax.
 2.  Severe pulmonary fibrosis, possible concurrent pulmonary edema.  Worsening
 right heart and/or biventricular decompensation.
