                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with transfer, chest injuries  // eval for pulm
 contusion, rib fxs
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low which limits evaluation.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There are streaky opacities
 throughout the right lung which likely represent atelectasis or infection in
 the appropriate setting.  Scattered left basal opacities also likely reflect
 atelectasis or infection.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Of note, a
 tubular, radiopaque density projects over the left hemi thorax which may be
 related to the patient's left scapula.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Markedly low lung volumes with multifocal streaky opacities that likely
 reflect atelectasis however infection/ aspiration should be considered in the
 appropriate setting.  Recommend repeat radiograph with proper positioning and
 increased inspiration for further evaluation.  At that time, the need for CT
 can be more adequately assessed.
