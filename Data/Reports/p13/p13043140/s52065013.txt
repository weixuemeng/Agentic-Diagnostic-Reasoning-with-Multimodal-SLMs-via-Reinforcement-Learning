                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with TBI presents with rib fractures. Oxygen
 requirement improving.  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the right hemi thorax is now
 nearly completely opacified with slight ipsilateral shift of the
 cardiomediastinal contours.  This appears to be due to a combination of
 worsening atelectasis of the right lung, with only a portion of the right
 upper lobe remaining aerated, as well as enlarging right pleural effusion. 
 Exam is otherwise remarkable for mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 improving atelectasis at the left lung base.
