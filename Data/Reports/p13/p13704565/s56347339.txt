                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Remote prior radiographs from ___ as well as more
 recent chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is again volume loss in the left upper hemithorax with upward retraction
 of the hilum.  Calcified subpleural opacification at the left lung apex
 appears very similar in pattern.  Small calcified granulomas are present in
 each upper lung with no definite superimposed opacity.  Left basilar opacity
 is most consistent with minor atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
