 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The sternotomy wires are in unchanged position.  There is increased
 diameter of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haze bilaterally.  The
 lung volumes are low and the cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  In
 addition, interstitial marking at the lung bases are seen and there is
 evidence of bronchial cuffing, bilaterally the costophrenic sinuses are
 blunted, indicating the presence of pleural effusion.  Overall, the findings
 are strongly suggestive for mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 No other lung parenchymal changes.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 5:04 p.m., Dr. ___ was paged for
