                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with shortness of breath and chest pain, evaluate for
 infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is increased
 prominence of the bilateral hila with extensive reticulonodular opacifications
 with a slightly central predominance.  There is stable blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle likely due to a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax
 evident.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.  Evidence of prior mitral
 valve repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticulonodular opacifications with slightly central
 predominance likely represent interstitial edema; however, atypical infection
 is a consideration.  Please correlate with lab values.
