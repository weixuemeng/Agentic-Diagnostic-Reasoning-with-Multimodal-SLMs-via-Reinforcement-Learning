                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with elevated white count
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is limited by patient rotation.  Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Large right
 thyroid goiter displaces the trachea to the left.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of COPD.  Minimal
 blunting of the costophrenic angle posteriorly on the left is compatible with
 a small pleural effusion, not substantially changed in the interval.  There is
 improved aeration of the left lung base with minimal streaky and linear
 opacities, likely atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the imaged thoracic spine.  A
 percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is noted in the left upper quadrant of the
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with improved atelectasis in the left lung base. 
 COPD.
