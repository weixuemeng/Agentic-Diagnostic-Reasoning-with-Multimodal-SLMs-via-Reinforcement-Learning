                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiography available.  Next CT is available from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart appears mildly enlarged.  Widened right mediastinal contour is
 associated with thyroid nodules that have been previously characterized.  A
 nodular focus projects over the lingula measuring about 15 mm.  Gastrostomy
 tube projects over the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Nodular focus
 projecting over the left mid lung which probably represents atelectasis or
 scarring.  However, given apparent nodularity, repeat PA and lateral
 radiographs are recommended when clinically appropriate to reassess.
