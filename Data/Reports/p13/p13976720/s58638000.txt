                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AML and fever  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, there has been little
 change in the appearance of the chest except for apparent development of a
 small right pleural effusion.  If clinical suspicion for infection persists,
 PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of the
 lung bases.
