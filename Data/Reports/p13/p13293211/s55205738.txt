                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:21 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension, seizure disorder, and chest
 pain.  Suspect aspiration during an emesis episode.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung could represent recent
 aspiration.  I would suggest a repeat chest radiograph in eight hours if the
 patient has clinical signs of pneumonia.  Heart size is top normal.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is new but there is no edema or pleural
 effusion.  Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but not dilated.
