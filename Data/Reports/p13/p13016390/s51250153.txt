                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with syncope and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT thoracic spine and chest radiograph.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded. Mildly increased interstitial markings
 diffusely may suggest mild interstitial edema, with more focal linear
 bibasilar opacities likely reflective of subsegmental atelectasis.  Cardiac
 size is normal.  There is a tortuous aorta.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Compression
 deformity of T12 is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and mildly increased
 interstitial markings likely reflective of mild interstitial edema.
