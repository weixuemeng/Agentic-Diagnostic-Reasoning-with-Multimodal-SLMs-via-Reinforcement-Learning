                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hepatic abscess status post drain placement with shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right upper quadrant.
 A density superimposed over it appears to correlate with post-surgical changes
 situated inferior and anterior to this site on the prior CT.  The position of
 the drain appears unchanged.  There is new opacification of the right lower
 lobe with volume loss and probably a portion of the right middle lobe with
 suspected pleural effusion.  There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the
 left.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is also increasing streaky left
 infrahilar opacification suggesting atelectasis.  Upper lobes remain clear. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New widespread opacification of the right lower lung, including
 probably the entirety of the right lower lobe and likely a substantial portion
 of the right middle lobe, including probable pleural effusion which is
 difficult to quantify.  However, much of the opacity is suspected to represent
 atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation associated with pneumonia.  CT or a
 right decubitus film might be helpful to assess for type and size of pleural
 effusion, if clinically indicated.
