                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PEA arrest, unresponsive // evaluate for tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina.  Enteric
 tube is distally coiled within the stomach which demonstrates moderate gaseous
 distension.  Heart size is normal.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is
 likely due to a combination of low lung volumes and AP technique with a
 tortuous aorta also noted.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures as
 a result of low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities
 in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 clearly seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Persistent moderate gaseous distension of the stomach.
 3. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
 4. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to combination of low
 lung volumes and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  This can be better
 assessed with repeat views with improved inspiratory effort, or alternatively
 chest CTA can be obtained for further assessment there is concern for an acute
 process.
