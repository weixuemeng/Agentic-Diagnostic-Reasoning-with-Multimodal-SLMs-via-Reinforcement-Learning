                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and dyspnea  // r/o infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal in size. The aorta is tortuous and shows some mural
 calcification.  The lung volumes are somewhat low which accentuates
 bronchovascular markings. Given that, there is increased opacity involving the
 right lower lobe which could represent atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting. The left lung appears clear. There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or infection in the
 appropriate setting.
