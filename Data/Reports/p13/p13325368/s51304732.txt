                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with mixed resp failure, intubated, evaluate tube placement,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 00:30.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube terminates approximately 3.1 cm above the carina in grossly
 appropriate location.  An enteric tube is identified, with distal tip
 projecting below the lower limits of the radiograph, with the majority of the
 distal part coiling and projecting over the left upper abdomen, likely within
 the stomach.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.  There is at least mild
 cardiomegaly, with enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There are
 diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with a central predominance, along with
 interlobular septal thickening, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
 and moderately severe CHF.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis,
 however developing infection would be difficult to exclude.  There is likely a
 small left pleural effusion.  There is no right gross pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Punctate density overlying the left neck raises the question of a small focus
 of left carotid artery calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable background hyperinflation/COPD.
 2. Mild moderate cardiomegaly, with enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 3. Moderately severe CHF, probably with areas of pulmonary edema.  Likely
 small left pleural effusion.
 4. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 5. ET tube and enteric tube nominal in position.
