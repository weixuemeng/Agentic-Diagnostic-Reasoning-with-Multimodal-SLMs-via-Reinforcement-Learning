                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // tube placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated and the ET tube terminates 6.3 cm from the carina.
 Enteric tube courses to at least the level of the distal esophagus but is then
 beyond the field of view.
 
 Lung volumes are low with worsening bilateral opacities. The partially
 visualized heart is grossly normal in size. The mediastinal hilar contours are
 normal. Kyphotic positioning limits the evaluation, however there is likely a
 new layering right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube 6.3 cm subcarinal should be advanced about 2 cm.
 2. Worsening bilateral opacities likely reflect pulmonary edema.
 3. New layering right pleural effusion
