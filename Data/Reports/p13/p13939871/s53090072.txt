                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Check NG tube.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The ET tube tip is 2.2 cm above
 the carina.  Right IJ line tip is in the SVC.  There is bilateral hazy
 vasculature and increased opacity projects over both lungs.  While some of
 this could be due to patient body habitus, it appears slightly worse on
 today's study compared to the prior and may represent alveolar edema.  Heart
 size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fluid overload.
