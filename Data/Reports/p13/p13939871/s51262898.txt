                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative with previous atelectatic changes and vascular
 congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed except for the right subclavian catheter, which
 extends to the right atrium.  Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal
 limits and there is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bibasilar
 opacifications most likely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  The
 dense retrocardiac opacification is no longer appreciated and the left
 hemidiaphragm is sharply seen.
