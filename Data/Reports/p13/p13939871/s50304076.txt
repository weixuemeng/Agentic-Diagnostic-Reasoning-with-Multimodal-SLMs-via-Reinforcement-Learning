 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:11 PM
  Enteric tube tip is not clearly delineated due to extensive soft tissues but a
  candidate is noted overlying the stomach. ET tube and Right IJ appear stable.
  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis also appears stable
  compared to prior study from the same day.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:54 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent NG tube placement.  Please evaluate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___ at 10:23 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the upper enteric tube is barely visible in the region of the
 gastroesophageal junction, where it may be looped retrograde into the distal
 esophagus.  I would recommend advancing the tube at 8-10 cm to make sure all
 the side ports are in the stomach.
 
 Opacification of both lower lobes persists, whether this is atelectasis alone
 or concurrent pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate.  There is also a
 contribution of at least small bilateral pleural effusion, no worse now than
 earlier in the day.  Previous mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion
 have improved since ___.  Heart is normal size.  ET tube and right
 internal jugular line are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
