                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, most recently of 4:56 AM.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Two subsequent frontal views of the chest were obtained.  New endotracheal
 tube terminates 6.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube, seen only on the
 second radiograph, terminates below the diaphragm.  Right central catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC. 
 
 Diffusely increased opacity of both lungs is compatible with pulmonary edema. 
 Right middle lobe and left lower lobe opacities persist, compatible with
 multifocal pneumonia.  Indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle is
 compatible with a pleural effusion.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.  
 2.  Multifocal pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary edema.
