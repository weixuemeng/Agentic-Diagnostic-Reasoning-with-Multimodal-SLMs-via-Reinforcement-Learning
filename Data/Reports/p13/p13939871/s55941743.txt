                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates left lower lobe
 consolidation compatible with pneumonia.  Additionally, partial obscuration of
 the right heart border makes a multifocal process likely.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia, most marked in the left lower lobe.
