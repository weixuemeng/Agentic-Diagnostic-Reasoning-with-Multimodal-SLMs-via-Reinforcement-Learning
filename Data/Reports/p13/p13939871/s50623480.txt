 is a right-sided PIC line which terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  There
 is an NG tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the
 body of the stomach.  The heart size is normal.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion with mild bilateral pulmonary edema.  Note is made of
 worsening of mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. There is
 also increased consolidation of the right lung base, which could be secondary
 to aspiration.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. ET tube terminates approximately 20 mm above the carina.
