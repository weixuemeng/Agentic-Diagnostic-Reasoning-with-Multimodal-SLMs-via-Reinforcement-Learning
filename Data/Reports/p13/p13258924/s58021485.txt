  Endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carinal. The right-sided PICC ends
  approximately 1.5 cm below the cavoatrial junction and appears lower in
  position compared with prior, which may be due to technical
  differences/expiratory exam. Slightly more prominent vascular congestion may
  also be due to underinflation.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation for airway protection, mental
 status  // check ET tube      check ET tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in
 place with its tip about 4 cm above the carina.  The right PICC line extends
 into the right atrium, further than on the previous study, approximately 2 cm
 above the carina.  There appears to be some increased engorgement of pulmonary
 vessels consistent with further elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. The
 hemidiaphragms are not as sharply seen, consistent with atelectatic changes
 and possible small effusions.
