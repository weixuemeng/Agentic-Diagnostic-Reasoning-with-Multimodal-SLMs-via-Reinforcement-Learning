                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with stemi, fever  // ? pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged and there are prominent mitral annular
 calcifications.  Prominent soft tissue density abuts the upper right
 mediastinum.  Small hazy opacity is present in the left lung base. Coarse
 interstitial lung markings appear chronic. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Distal right clavicle fracture appears chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Small left base opacity may represent pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 2. Prominent soft tissue density abutting the upper right mediastinum may
 represent tortuosity of vessels or thyroid lesion. A paramediastinal mass is
 thought less likely. Additional imaging may be obtained as clinically
 warranted.
 
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.
