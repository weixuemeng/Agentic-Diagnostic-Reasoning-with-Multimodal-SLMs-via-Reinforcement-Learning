 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is a small left pleural
 effusion in a tiny right pleural effusion.  Left lower lobe opacity likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left.  Left lower lobe patchy
 opacity is likely atelectasis.
