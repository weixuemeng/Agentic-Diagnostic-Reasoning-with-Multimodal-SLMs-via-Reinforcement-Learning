                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypotension
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is appears mildly enlarged but similar.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion with a small left pleural effusion, perhaps increased in
 the interval.  Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small left pleural
 effusion, perhaps minimally increased in the interval, with left basilar
 opacity, likely atelectasis.  Infection, however, is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
