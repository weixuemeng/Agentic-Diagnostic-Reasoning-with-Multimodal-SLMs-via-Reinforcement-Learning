                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The main pulmonary
 artery contour is also somewhat prominent which may suggest pulmonary arterial
 enlargement.  Central pulmonary arteries are mildly prominent.  The aortic
 arch is calcified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the mid thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Enlarged main pulmonary artery
 contour and prominence of central pulmonary arteries, which may reflect
 potentially pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No evidence for congestive heart
 failure, however.
