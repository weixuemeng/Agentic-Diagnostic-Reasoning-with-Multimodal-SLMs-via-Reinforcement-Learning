                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Renal failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.  Per the radiology
 technologist, this is the best possible film, the patient cannot keep chin up.
 
 Left-sided pacer device is stable in position.  There is a stable prominent
 ovoid calcification projecting over the left mediastinal border.  Perihilar
 haziness is again seen, which may be due to a mild pulmonary edema or in part
 related to underpenetration from overlying patient's soft tissue.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  No definite large pleural effusion is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, the appearance of the lungs has not significantly
 changed.  If anything, pulmonary edema appears slightly decreased as compared
 to the prior study.
