                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chest tightness and cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged and pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature
 engorged, all suggesting biventricular cardiac decompensation, although I see
 no pulmonary edema as yet and pleural effusion is not detected.  Lungs are
 clear of any focal abnormality.
