 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stage 5 CKD, HTN, and DM with hyperkalemia
 and elevated creatinine  // Fluid overload, r/o respiratory infection    
 Fluid overload, r/o respiratory infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette increased slightly since
 ___, though exaggerated by AP orientation.  Whether this is cardiomegaly
 alone or in conjunction with pericardial effusion is radiographically
 indeterminate.  Caliber of the mediastinum suggests elevated central venous
 pressure and there is pulmonary vascular congestion and borderline edema.
 
 Pleural effusions are small.  Bibasilar opacification in the lungs could be
 due to atelectasis alone though pneumonia is not excluded.
