                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pain s/p mvc  // neck and back pain s/p falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The heart size is normal.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The right hilum appears more dense than the
 left and is associated with a more focal opacity in the suprahilar region.  . 
 The mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise unremarkable. Multiple age
 indeterminate compression deformities of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetrical appearance of the right hilum compared to the left is potentially
 related to rotation in the setting of scoliosis, but a high hilar or juxta
 hilar mass is not excluded in the absence of older radiographs for comparison.
 Additional shallow oblique radiographs or chest CT on nonemergent basis is
 recommended in the absence of priors.
