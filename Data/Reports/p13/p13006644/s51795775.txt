                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DKA, concern for infection.  // Evaluate
 for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral diffuse fluffy opacities are increased from previous examination
 suggestive of pulmonary edema.  Loss of visualization of the bilateral
 hemidiaphragms suggests layering effusions.  Stable cardiomegaly.  An impacted
 fracture of the left humeral surgical neck with periosteal new bone formation
 and dislocation of the humerus from glenoid is chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and layering pleural effusion.  In view of extensive
 pulmonary changes, this impossible to exclude super infection.
