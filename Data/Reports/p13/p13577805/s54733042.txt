                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and without change.  Within
 the lungs, a patchy opacity at the left lung base is new and may reflect
 patchy atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely an early focus of pneumonia. 
 Followup PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to ensure
 resolution when the patient's condition permits.
