                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with cyanosis and shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal semi supine chest radiograph demonstrates a normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal
 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is prominent pulmonary
 vasculature.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Prominent upper lobe pulmonary vasculature
 is noted, which could in part be due to patient positioning.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs to better
 evaluate the pulmonary vascularity are advised when the patient is clinically
 able.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Recommendations were emailed to the ED QA nurses by Dr.
