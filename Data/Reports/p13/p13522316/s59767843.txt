                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and rhonchi on exam  // cough, rhonchi
 on exam r/o infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted.  The lung
 volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal structures.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural
 effusion.
 
 A minimally increased radiodensity at the crossing of the clavicle and the
 first rib is likely due by a combination of subpleural fat and patient
 rotation.  However, the area should receive attention on the next follow-up
 examination.
