                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with altered mental status, evaluate for
 infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a sub-optimal inspiratory effort and low lung volumes. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. The bilateral hila are
 unremarkable. Right cardiophrenic angle and diffuse interstitial prominence
 likely reflects bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes.
 Linear opacities at the left lung base are consistent with subsegmental
 atelectasis. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
