                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, chills, central line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates at the caval atrial
 junction.  Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is mildly enlarged
 but accentuated due to low lung volumes.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures with likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion has increased compared to the prior
 study.  Additionally patchy opacities within the right lung base likely
 reflect compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with increased size of moderate right
 pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacification may reflect compressive
 atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
