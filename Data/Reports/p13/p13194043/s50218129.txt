                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Gram-positive bacteremia, now with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates improved bilateral
 pulmonary opacities since prior imaging.  The slightly less transparent lungs
 on this exam are likely secondary to the AP portable technique used on this
 exam when compared to the previous imaging PA views.  The pulmonary vessels
 appear slightly improved since prior imaging.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly improved bilateral pulmonary opacities.
