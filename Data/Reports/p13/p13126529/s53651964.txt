                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are persistently low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  There are
 diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Focal opacity is seen within the right upper lobe concerning for
 pneumonia, and worse compared to the previous radiograph from ___. 
 Patchy and interstitial opacities within the lung bases bilaterally also
 appear similar compared to the prior study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There
 are mild multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe as well as persistent
