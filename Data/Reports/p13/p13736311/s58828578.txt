                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE PLAIN FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with encephalopathy, NG tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube remains in place, coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable,
 with the heart being upper limits of normal in size given AP technique.  There
 are patchy opacities at both bases which could reflect aspiration, bibasilar
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  A more focal nodular opacity at the right base is
 more suggestive of an evolving pneumonia when compared to serial chest films
 dating back to ___.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Apical pleural
 thickening unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  Linear opacities at the right lung
 apex likely reflect scarring secondary to known underlying severe emphysema. 
 No pneumothorax.
