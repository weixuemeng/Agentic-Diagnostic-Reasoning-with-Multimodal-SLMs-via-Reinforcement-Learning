 The lungs remain hyperinflated.  Increased reticular markings seen
 particularly at the bases is similar compared to prior.  Lobulated right lung
 base mass is again noted.  Faint opacity projecting over the right upper lobe
 is unchanged from prior chest CT, potentially scarring.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Old right lateral rib fractures are noted.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities.

 Findings compatible with emphysema, chronic interstitial lung process, and
 spiculated right lower lobe mass.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
