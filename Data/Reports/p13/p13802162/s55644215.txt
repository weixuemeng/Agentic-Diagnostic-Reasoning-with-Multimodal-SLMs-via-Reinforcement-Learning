 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, recent admission for SBO, with
 atlectasis and effusions on CXR.  // Assess for resolution of abnormalities
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis have resolved. Large lung
 volumes suggest small airway obstruction.  Heart size is normal. Septal
 thickening in the lower lungs could be a chronic finding, rather than acute
 pulmonary edema, since there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement cardiomegaly
 or pleural effusion.
