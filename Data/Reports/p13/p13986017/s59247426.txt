                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with s/p fall, anterior superior CW bruising, weakness  //
 fracture or bleed?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle suggests small effusions, as on
 prior.  Chain sutures seen over the right mid lung.  Linear opacity in the
 retrocardiac region is likely atelectasis.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear. 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 seen in the thoracic aorta as well as degenerative changes in the spine.  No
 displaced fracture seen on this nondedicated exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Probable left basilar atelectasis. 
 Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
