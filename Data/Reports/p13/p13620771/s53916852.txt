                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypercalcemia.  Question lung mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is a focal
 peripheral opacity in the left mid lung laterally with configuration
 suggesting that it is pleural-based.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Approximately 5 cm likely pleural-based mass on the left. 
 Dedicated chest CT can be performed to further characterize.
