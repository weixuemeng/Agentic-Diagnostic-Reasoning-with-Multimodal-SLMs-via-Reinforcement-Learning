                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___M PMHx Stage IV, DLBCL with extensive metastatic disease who
 presents for initiation of high dose MTX in the setting of worsening radicular
 back pain.  // 1) Please evaluate for PICC tip placement, 45cm right brachial;
 2) Please evaluate for evidence of pleural effusion or infiltrate (no signs or
 symptoms to suggest active process at present)
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs and chest CT ___ and ___,
 respectively.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The soft tissue component of metastasis to the left fourth rib has resolved. 
 Expansion of the rib is the only residual abnormality locally.
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.  7 mm
 nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung at the level of the fifth
 anterior interspace could be the right nipple.  Item fully if there is
 clinical justification for investigate in at lesion further given the extent
 of malignancy elsewhere, but a CT scan would be definitive. Lungs are
 otherwise clear.
