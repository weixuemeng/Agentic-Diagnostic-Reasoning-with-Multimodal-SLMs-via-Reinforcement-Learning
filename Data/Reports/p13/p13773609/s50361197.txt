 FINDINGS: 
 
 Old calcified right lower lobe focus is stable since the prior study, with
 differential diagnosis of focal calcified pleural plaque or less likely
 calcified granuloma.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  Slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle could be due to pleural thickening or trace
 pleural effusion.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.  The bones are relatively osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
