  Large density projecting along the lower posterior chest on the lateral view,
  probably to the right of midline.  Although a hiatal hernia with associated
  atelectasis or scarring could be considered, it is not possible to exclude a
  mass or consolidation.  No prior studies are available.  Achest CT is
  suggested to evaluate further.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary interstitium is mildly coarse which is
 nonspecific and may reflect airway inflammation, slight congestion or mild
 interstitial disease.  The lateral view depicts a large oval density
 projecting over the middle to posterior mediastinum, possibly a large hiatal
 hernia although there is no air-fluid level to confirm, and probably centered
 to the right of midline.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may
 suggest a small pleural effusion or potentially chronic scarring.  The right
 acromiohumeral interval is completely effaced with mild-to-moderate
 degenerative change, suggestive of rotator cuff pathology.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large density projecting along the lower posterior chest on the
 lateral view, probably to the right of midline.  Although a hiatal hernia with
 associated atelectasis or scarring could be considered, it is not possible to
 exclude a mass or consolidation.  Comparison to prior radiographs may be
 helpful if clinically appropriate.  A chest CT is suggested to evaluate
 further when clinically appropriate.
