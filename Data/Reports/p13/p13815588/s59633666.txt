                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post pneumonia, now returning with
 shortness of breath and chest pain.  Evaluate for infectious process or
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size.  The heart apex is silhouetted by a prominent pericardial fat
 pad.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small
 pleural effusion.  The right lung appears clear without effusion.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion.  Prominent left pericardial fat pad.
 Please refer to subsequent CT chest for further details.
