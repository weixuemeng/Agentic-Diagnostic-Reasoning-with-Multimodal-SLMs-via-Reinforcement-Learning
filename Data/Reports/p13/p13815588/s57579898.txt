                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Apical pneumothorax after CT removal, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The air-fluid levels on the left are again seen, as is
 the pleural thickening or loculated collection posteriorly.  No definite
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  
 
 The right lung is essentially clear.
