 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dysphagia and sensation of food being stuck in throat.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Linear opacity in the right middle lobe suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring that is unchanged.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Mild degenerative changes are similar along the lower thoracic spine.
