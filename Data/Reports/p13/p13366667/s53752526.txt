                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with unresponsiveness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest wall dual-lead pacing device is noted.  The lungs are
 clear of confluent consolidation where not obscured by the pacing device and
 cardiac leads.  There is a probable hiatal hernia.  The cardiac silhouette is
 within normal limits for technique.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at
 the aortic arch.  The trachea is deviated to the left at the thoracic inlet,
 and there is increased soft tissue in the right paratracheal region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Leftward deviation of
 the trachea at the thoracic inlet with increased right-sided soft tissue
 density.  While this might all be due to right-sided thyroid enlargement given
 degree of the soft tissue abnormality, dedicated nonurgent chest CT is
 suggested to exclude underlying mass lesion- unless this area has been imaged
 already at another institution.
