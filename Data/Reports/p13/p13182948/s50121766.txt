                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Opacity at left costophrenic angle.  Reevaluate.
 
 The position of the left PICC line cannot be evaluated on today's film.  The
 opacity in the left cardiophrenic angle is again seen, but the lateral film
 strongly suggests that this is an effusion rather than an area of infarct.
 
 The lung fields are otherwise clear.  Drainage catheter is seen overlying the
 liver area.
