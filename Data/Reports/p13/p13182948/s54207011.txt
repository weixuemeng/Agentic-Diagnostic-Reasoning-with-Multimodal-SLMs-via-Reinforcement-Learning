                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatic cancer, weakness, cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital film from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared
 parenchymal opacity at the lateral aspects of the left hemithorax.  The
 opacity obliterates the lateral aspects of the left costophrenic sinus.  The
 sinusoid contour of the opacity, together with its homogeneity, suggests the
 presence of a small pleural effusion rather than pneumonia.  However, the
 change should be followed with close radiographic monitoring.  The opacity is
 more obvious on the frontal than on the lateral radiograph.
 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures. 
 Post-surgical clips projecting over the midline in the upper abdomen.
