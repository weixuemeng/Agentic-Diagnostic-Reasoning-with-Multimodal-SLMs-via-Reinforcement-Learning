                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe, question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate ill-defined
 opacity in the left lower zone of well-expanded lungs.  The cardiac silhouette
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  The pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lung opacities likely reflect pneumonia. Recommend
 bilateral oblique views for confirmation.
 
 I made several attempts to page Dr. ___ (a.___ ___) but received
 no response and so these recommendations were posted to the online radiology
 results reporting tool for clinician notification.
