                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post ablation of left lower lobe lesion.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  This is a chest radiograph 112 cm and today.
 
 FINDINGS: The ground-glass opacity seen in the right upper lobe has since
 resolved.  There is no pleural effusion.  A more focal area of consolidation
 within the left mid lung zone is thought to represent a hematoma after
 ablation.  There is no pleural effusion.  Hiatal hernia is again seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Resolving post ablation changes without a pneumothorax.
