                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever, recurrent PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___ and prior chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Previously noted PICC line is
 been removed.  Patient is known to have a large hiatal hernia accounting for
 retrocardiac opacity partially obscuring the right medial lung base.  Right
 lower lobe consolidation is concerning for pneumonia/aspiration.  There is
 persistent nodularity in the left mid lung peripherally with subtle spiculated
 margins.  A prominent bleb is noted at the left lung apex.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted, right greater than left.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar to prior.  Imaged bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe consolidation is concerning for pneumonia/ aspiration.
 2. Small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 3. Large hiatal hernia.
 4. Spiculated nodularity in the left mid lung peripherally appears similar to
 multiple prior exams.  Nonemergent CT may be considered as neoplasm difficult
 to exclude.
