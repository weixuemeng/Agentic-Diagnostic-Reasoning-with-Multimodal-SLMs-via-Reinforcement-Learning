  Positioning is improved with decreased kyphosis however the patient is still
  rotated to the right.  There is persistent small left pleural effusion and
  possible new left basilar opacity likely atelectasis although pneumonia cannot
  be completely excluded.  The right base is partially obscured by the heart but
  a small pleural effusion may be present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lucency at left apex likely corresponds to known hydropneumothorax
 more fully characterized on CT, ___.  Adjacent increased lung opacity
 corresponds to post-ablation site and postoperative changes from left upper
 lobe resection.
 
 Interval improved aeration at the left base, as well as apparent slight
 decrease in size of left pleural effusion.  In the right hemithorax, chronic
 collapse of right middle lobe is accompanied by near complete collapse of
 right lower lobe, minimally improved from recent radiograph, and accompanied
 by an adjacent small pleural effusion.
