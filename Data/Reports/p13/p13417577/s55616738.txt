                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ study.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left apical hydropneumothorax is probably unchanged, currently best
 visualized on the lateral view.  Adjacent increased lung opacity at left apex
 corresponds to known post-RFA and postoperative site, more fully evaluated on
 recent CT.  Interval improvement in extent of right lower lobe atelectasis,
 but apparent increase in now moderate right pleural effusion.  Moderate left
 pleural effusion is similar.
