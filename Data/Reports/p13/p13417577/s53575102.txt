                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea  // eval for acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Airspace consolidation within
 the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia. The previously noted right
 pleural effusion has resolved. A cavitary structure in the left lung apex
 measures 2.6 x 2.6 cm with peripheral/apical opacity could reflect prior
 infection or malignancy. A retrocardiac opacity better assessed on previous
 imaging is consistent with a known hiatal hernia.  Please correlate
 clinically. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Cavitary lesion in the left apex with apical opacity, question sequelae of
 old infection/malignancy.  Consider CT to further assess once the acute
 symptoms resolve.
 3.  Hiatal hernia.
