  The patient is rotated to the right and kyphotic severely limiting the
  evaluation.   Apparent bibasilar opacities may reflect this poor positioning
  and are inadequately evaluated.  Small loculated left apical hydropneumothorax
  is not appreciably changed.  If clinically indicated the study can be repeated
  with better positioning. 
  
  The findings were discussed by Dr. [___] with Dr. [___, He] [on the
  telephone] on [___] at [7:11 PM], [5] minutes after discovery of the
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar appearance of left apical hydropneumothorax, as well as
 adjacent parenchymal opacities related to post-RFA site and post-operative
 site in this patient status post partial left lung resection.  Marked
 worsening opacification in lower right hemithorax involving right middle and
 right lower lobes may reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but
 co-existing infectious consolidation is possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size as
 well in the interval.
