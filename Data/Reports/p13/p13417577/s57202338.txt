                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumothorax status post pigtail catheter placement,
 dyspneic, hypotensive.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:47 a.m., no gross change is identified.  Again seen
 is a left-sided pigtail catheter, with a small effusion and associated
 atelectasis/consolidation at the left base, possibly slightly improved.  There
 is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and minimal atelectasis at
 the right base, slightly different in configuration, but not appreciably
 increased.  Again seen is a heterogeneous lucency and opacity at the left lung
 apex and surgical sutures in the upper left lung.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  The known hiatal hernia is less apparent on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal improvement in the changes at the left base. 
 Otherwise, no significant change compared with ___ at 8:47 a.m.  No
 definite pneumothorax.  Please see prior report.
