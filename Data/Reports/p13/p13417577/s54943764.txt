                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with similar prominence of the hila bilaterally. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 emphysematous changes again noted.  Sutures from prior wedge resection is
 visualized in the left upper lung field.  4 cm cavitary lesion within the left
 apex appears relatively unchanged.  Residual patchy opacity is seen within the
 right lung base, which appears improved, however worsening ill-defined
 opacities are seen within the left mid lung field.  Previously seen
 consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe may be slightly improved in the
 interval.  Small left pleural effusion is likely present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Worsening patchy ill-defined opacities in the left mid lung field
 concerning for pneumonia.
 2. Residual patchy opacity in the right lung base which may reflect an area of
 resolving infection or continued but improved infection.
 3. Previously noted area of consolidation in the left lower lobe appears
 somewhat improved.  Small left pleural effusion likely present.
 4. Unchanged cavitary lesion in the left apex.
