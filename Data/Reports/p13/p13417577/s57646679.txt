                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung adenocarcinoma and h/o pneumothorax 
 // ? pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiograph suggested in ___ through ___ and CTA of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval increase in
 vascular congestion.  There is opacification of the bilateral bases, right
 greater than left, with small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
 atelectasis. Superimposed infection could be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  The known small left apical hydro-pneumothorax has
 decreased in size over the interval.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.    Increased opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left,
 with small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Superimposed
 infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Slight interval decrease in size of the small left apical
 hydropneumothorax.
