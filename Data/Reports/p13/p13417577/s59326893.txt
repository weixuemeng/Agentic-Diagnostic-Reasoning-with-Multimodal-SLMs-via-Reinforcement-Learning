                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumothorax and acute desaturation and
 hypotension.  // ? tension pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ of ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 results in bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent increased
 opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left, consistent with
 pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.  The known left apical
 hydro-pneumothorax is unchanged in appearance over the interval.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are also unchanged.  Increased vascular
 congestion is concerning for pulmonary edema. There are two hyperdense stripes
 is seen projecting over the trachea, one likely corresponds the endotracheal
 tube. The other is of unclear origin. The assumed endotracheal tube ends 3 cm
 from the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Two hyperdense stripes are seen projecting over the trachea, one
 corresponds endotracheal tube and the other is of unclear origin. Recommend
 repeat chest radiograph to further assess the origin of this finding.
 
 3. Increased vascular congestion concerning for pulmonary edema.
