                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX s/p pigtail placement - eval for
 interval change  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray from ___ 16:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left sided pigtail catheter is in place. The previously seen basilar
 pneumothorax is not clearly identified on this film. No obvious pneumothorax
 is detected at this time. There is a small effusion at the left lung base with
 underlying collapse and or consolidation which has progressed compared with
 the prior film.
 
 Again seen is some focal density overlying the left lung apex, not fully
 characterized. Also again seen are sutures in the left upper zone.
 
 There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, which is new compared with the
 prior film. No gross right effusion.
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation/ COPD. The heart is not enlarged.
 No CHF There is an apparent hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1)  No definite left pneumothorax. Interval development of small left effusion
 with underlying collapse and or consolidation.
 
 2) Patchy opacity left apex, not fully characterized. The differential
 diagnosis includes a focal nodular density, focal scarring, or possibly a
 focal infiltrate. There are nearby sutures. Clinical correlation with details
 of the patient's history and any outside chest CTs is recommended for full
 assessment. In the absence of a known pathology in this location, further
 assessment with chest CT would be recommended.
 
 3) Background COPD.
 
 4)  Hiatal hernia.
 
 5) Minimal atelectasis right base laterally.
