                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left upper lobe lesion status post RFA, assess pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CT from the
 interventional procedure done ___ at 11:11.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a small left apical
 pneumothorax which is likely stable allowing for differences in technique. 
 Opacification in the left upper lung likely relates to recent RFA. Stable
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pleural effusion or right
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax likely stable allowing for differences in
 technique with postprocedure changes in the left upper lung.
