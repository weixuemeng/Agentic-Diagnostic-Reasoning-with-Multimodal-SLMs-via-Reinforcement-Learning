                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a left-sided chest tube, a left apical
 hydropneumothorax is not appreciably changed in size.  The air-fluid level is
 again demonstrated at the interspace between the left fifth and sixth
 posterior rib levels.  Homogeneous increased opacity partially obscuring right
 heart border and right hemidiaphragm is concerning for developing atelectasis
 involving right middle and right lower lobes, likely due to mucoid impaction
 in the bronchus intermedius.  Improving aeration at left lung base with some
 residual mild atelectasis remaining.  Persistent small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Incidental hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No substantial change in left apical hydropneumothorax following left
 chest tube removal in this patient status post left upper lobe wedge
 resection.
 
 2.  Worsening atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobe.
 
 3.  Improving aeration of left lung base.
 
 Dr. ___ was notified by telephone about these results on ___.
