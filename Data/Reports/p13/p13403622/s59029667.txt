                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lower right lateral rib fracture is consistent with old injury
 based on review of CT abdomen of ___.  No definite acute right
 rib fracture is evident, but portable chest radiographs have a low sensitivity
 for detecting acute rib fractures.  No visible pneumothorax, and overall
 similar appearance of the chest to the prior study performed earlier today
 except for improving right upper lobe opacity, which may have been due to
 asymmetrical edema or aspiration.
