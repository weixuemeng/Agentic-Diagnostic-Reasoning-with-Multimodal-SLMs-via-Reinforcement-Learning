 HISTORY:  Intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.

 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 2.5 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube is
 within the stomach as is the side port.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged with a large pseudoaneurysm again noted arising from the aortic
 arch.  Streaky opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion is demonstrated.  There has been resection of the proximal right
 humerus including detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube is slightly low lying terminating 2.5 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube is in standard position.  Redemonstration of large aortic arch
 pseudoaneurysm.
