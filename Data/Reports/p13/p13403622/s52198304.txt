                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available as the patient is status EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess but appears at least mildly enlarged.  Opacity adjacent to the aortic
 knob could potentially reflect a pseudoaneurysm of the aortic arch or other
 mass lesion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is no pulmonary edema. There is
 diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with loss of height of a
 vertebral body of the thoracolumbar junction.  Mild S-shaped scoliosis of the
 thoracolumbar spine is present.  The right humeral head has been resected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Opacity adjacent to the aortic knob is concerning for a pseudoaneurysm or
 other mediastinal lesion and further assessment with CT of the chest is
 recommended if not done previously.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  
 
 ADDENDUM:
 The patient has now been indentified in our PACS and prior comparison exam
 from ___ is now available for review. The large opacity adjacent to
 the aortic knob is compatible with the patient's known pseudoaneursym of the
 aortic arch and appears unchanged.
