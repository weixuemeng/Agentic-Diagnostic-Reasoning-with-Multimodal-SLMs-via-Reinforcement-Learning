                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aortic pseudoaneurysm with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  Again
 demonstrated is a rounded opacity in the left aorticopulmonary window
 compatible with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm, similar in size and
 appearance compared to prior chest radiograph, currently measuring 5.3 x 4.2
 cm.  The aorta remains tortuous.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal linear opacities in the
 right lung base likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 There has been surgical removal of the right proximal humerus including the
 head.  Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged abnormal mediastinal contour corresponding to the patient's known
 pseudoaneurysm, without evidence of rupture.  Right basilar linear
 atelectasis.
