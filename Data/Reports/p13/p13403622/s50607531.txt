  1.  Possible increase in size of thoracic aortic pseudo aneurysm from ___ but no widening or indistinctness of the mediastinum to suggest
  acute rupture.  Followup with CTA is in process.
  2. Nodular opacities projecting over the right upper lung zone with no
  correlate on the prior CT.  Attention on subsequent CTA is recommended.  
  3. Increased lucency along the medial aspect of the left lung apex may
  represent small pneumothorax.  A bulla was present in the left lung apex on
  the prior CT of ___.  
  4. Stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of thoracic aortic pseudo aneurysm now with new chest pain,
 here to evaluate for evidence of leak or rupture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA torso dated ___.  Chest radiograph last performed
 on ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Note is again made of a round, well-circumscribed density in the left
 mediastinum filling the aortopulmonary window, which corresponds to the
 patient's known pseudoaneurysm.  The pseudoaneurysm measures approximately 5.5
 x 4.3 cm on today's examination compared to 4.2 x 3.4 cm when measured in a
 similar plane on coronal imaging.  The mediastinum is not indistinct in
 comparison to the prior CT.  The trachea remains focally deviated to the
 right.  A small meniscus in the left lung base corresponds to epicardial fat
 on the prior CT.  No significant pleural effusion is present.  Indistinct
 nodular opacities projected over the right upper lung zone, which may be
 vascular. A bulla is present in the left lung apex on the prior CT.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged but unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Possible increase in size of thoracic aortic pseudo aneurysm from ___ but no other widening or indistinctness of the mediastinum to
 suggest acute rupture.  Followup with CTA is in process.
 
 2. Stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly.  
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ telephone at the
 time of study interpretation at 1:00PM on ___.
