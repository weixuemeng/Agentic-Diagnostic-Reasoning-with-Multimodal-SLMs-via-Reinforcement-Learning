                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A large aortic pseudoaneurysm arising from the arch is re- demonstrated,
 similar in configuration compared to the prior study.  Moderate cardiomegaly
 is also unchanged and there is re- demonstration of a a moderate size hiatal
 hernia.  Streaky opacity in the right lung base may reflect an area of
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  There is no pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Marked atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen involving the aorta.  Several ring like densities
 within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen may reflect diverticula with
 residual contrast.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded.  Large aortic pseudoaneurysm, unchanged.  Moderate size hiatal
 hernia.
