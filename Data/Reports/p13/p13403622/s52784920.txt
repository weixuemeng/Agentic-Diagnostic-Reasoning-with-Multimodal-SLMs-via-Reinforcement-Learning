                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post aneurysm repair, with atrial fibrillation and
 flutter, on Coumadin.  New shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA of the chest from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A rounded opacity in the left aortopulmonary window is consistent
 with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm, and appears unchanged from the prior
 radiographs.  The aorta is dilated and tortuous, also unchanged.  The heart
 size is moderately enlarged, and stable.  Right basilar atelectasis or
 scarring is unchanged.  There is no new consolidation.  The previously
 identified mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Grossly unchanged appearance of the dilated tortuous aorta with a known
 large pseudoaneurysm.
 2.  Unchanged right basilar atelectasis or scarring.
 3.  No pulmonary edema or evidence of pneumonia.
