 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, thoracic and lumbar spine
 radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and
 emphysematous changes noted in the lung apices. No pulmonary edema is present.
 Mild interstitial abnormalities are noted within the lower lobes, likely
 suggestive of chronic changes. More focal linear opacity within the lingula
 indicates atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Severe compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged from ___, but a severe compression
 fracture of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction appears new.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema, lingular atelectasis, and probable mild chronic interstitial
 abnormality in the lung bases. Severe compression fracture of a vertebral body
 at the thoracolumbar junction is new compared to ___.
