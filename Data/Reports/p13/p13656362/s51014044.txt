                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia after a fall.  // ? ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright AP image of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. The previously seen opacity in the right medial
 lung base has decreased from prior exam.  No new focus of opacity is seen.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable.  Old rib fractures are unchanged from prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 If there is concern for acute rib or spine fractures, dedicated views of the
 points of tenderness should be performed.  Hyperinflation consistent with
 emphysema.
 
 Interval decrease in opacity in the right medial lung base. Lateral view is
 recommended to confirm whether previous pneumonia has substantially cleared.
