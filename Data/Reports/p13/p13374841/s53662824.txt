                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MV repair, question pneumothorax, line change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day at 7:34 a.m., the right IJ sheath has been
 changed to a right IJ central line with tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is cardiomegaly,
 with sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve.  The hilar are also prominent. 
 There is upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring and probable
 areas of alveolar edema, consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema.  There is a
 moderately large left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 and a small-to-moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  The left effusion may be slightly larger, but more likely
 appears different due to differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) New right IJ central line with tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 2) CHF.  Bilateral left greater than right effusions with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Equivocal slight increase in the left effusion.
