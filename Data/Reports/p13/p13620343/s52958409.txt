                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, known PID, cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or
 effusion is identified.  The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. 
 Compared with ___, and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Clips noted in the upper abdomen.
