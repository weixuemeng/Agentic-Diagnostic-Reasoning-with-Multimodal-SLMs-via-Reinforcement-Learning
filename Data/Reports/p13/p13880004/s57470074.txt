                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man, heavy smoker, with persistent cough  // Assess
 for lung infection/mass
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased evidence of
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms and increase of the retrosternal space on the
 lateral radiograph, strongly indicative of on going overinflation, potentially
 in the context of developing COPD.  Calcified paratracheal and mediastinal
 lymph nodes are better visible than on the previous image.  No evidence of
 pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
