                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with recent recurrence, now with malaise,
 fatigue and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Widening of the
 right superior mediastinal contour and rightward deviation of the upper
 trachea likely reflect underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are noted.  Adjacent
 retrocardiac atelectasis is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are detected.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Associated left
 basilar atelectasis. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
