                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent bowel perforation.  Question ET
 tube and OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___ and chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube is in place with tip 3.4 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube extends inferiorly with side port in the stomach.  A right
 internal jugular approach central venous catheter has tip in the mid SVC. 
 Prominent mediastinal contour with widening likely represent a combination of
 vascular engorgement and underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy compatible
 with lymphoma.  Although mediastinal hematoma is not excluded status post new
 central line placement, lack of tracheal deviation makes this less likely. 
 The cardiac silhouette is prominent.  The lung volumes are low, with new
 interval development of a moderate left pleural effusion and dense
 retrocardiac opacity compatible with atelectasis.  The right lung is
 relatively clear.
 
 A rounded density in the left supraclavicular soft tissues measures at least
 5.2 x 4.4 cm, upon correlation with prior CT dated ___, consistent with
 a large centrally necrotic nodal mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes appropriate in position.
 2.  New moderate left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
 3.  Upper mediastinal widening compatible with a combination of vascular
 engorgement and underlying adenopathy.
 4.  Dominant left supraclavicular nodal mass.
