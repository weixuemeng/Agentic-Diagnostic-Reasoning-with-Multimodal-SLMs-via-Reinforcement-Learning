 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Subdural hematoma, intubation and sedation, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:33 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated.  Lung volumes, however, remain constant.  The right internal
 jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. 
 There is unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, combined to a
 left pleural effusion and areas of retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax is visible.  No new parenchymal opacities suggesting
 pneumonia.  No right pleural effusion.
