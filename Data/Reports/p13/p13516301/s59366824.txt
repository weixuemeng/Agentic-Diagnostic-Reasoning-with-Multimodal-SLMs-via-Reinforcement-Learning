 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Focal
 opacity at the left costophrenic angle is again seen, which may be due to
 atelectasis/scarring, a trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  Slight
 increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to mild
 interstitial edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
 There is no focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible minimal interstitial edema.  No large pleural effusion. 
 Stable cardiac silhouette size.
