                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.  History of prior wedge resection of the left lower lobe.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild deviation of the trachea to the left is unchanged and related
 to right thyroid nodules.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax. Left basilar linear opacity likely reflects
 atelectasis/scarring from prior left lower lobe segmentectomy.   The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal with the exception of aortic tortuosity
 and arch calcifications.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
