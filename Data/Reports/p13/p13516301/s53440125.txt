 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p dual chamber pacemaker via L axillary vein 
 // rule out pneumothorax      rule out pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 dual-channel pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle.  No evidence a pneumothorax.
 There is engorgement of pulmonary vessels. This could reflect some increase in
 pulmonary venous pressure, though the current images supine rather than erect
 as well as AP rather than PA, which could also accentuate the pulmonary
 markings.
 Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
