                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Productive cough and chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT 8 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 Right basilar atelectasis and effusion are similar.  Left basilar scarring has
 not changed.  There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly and
 mild aortic arch calcifications are unchanged.  Minimal peribronchial
 opacities are apparent at right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Mild right basilar peribronchial opacities could be a nidus of early
 infection.
