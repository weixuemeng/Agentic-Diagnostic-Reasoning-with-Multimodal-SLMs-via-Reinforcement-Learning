                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left-sided chest pain reproducible by palpation, assess for
 acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Post-surgical
 changes are noted in the left upper lung with evidence of prior left upper
 lobectomy with upward retraction of the left pulmonary hilum and scarring and
 pleural thickening at the left lung apex.  There is a stable pattern of
 reticular and peripheral nodular opacities in the bilateral mid and upper
 lungs which when compared with the prior CT appears to represent areas of
 pleuroparenchymal scarring.  There is no sign of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 overall stable.  Bony structures appear unchanged with left sixth rib
 resection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes with areas of scarring in the bilateral
 upper lungs in this patient with prior left upper lobectomy.  No superimposed
 consolidation or acute interval changes.
