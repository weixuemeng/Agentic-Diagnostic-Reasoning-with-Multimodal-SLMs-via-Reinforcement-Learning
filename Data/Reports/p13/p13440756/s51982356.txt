                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic granulomatous disease, cough and malaise, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Post-surgical changes in the left upper lung and fibrotic changes in
 the right upper lung with massive deviation of the hilar structures deviating
 the hila towards the upper lung zones.  Inflated lower lungs show no evidence
 of pneumonia or other acute parenchymal change.  No pleural effusion on the
 frontal image.  On the lateral image, there is blunting of the left
 costophrenic sinus dorsally, which could reflect a small quantity of pleural
 fluid.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the chest wall.
