                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for continued presence of pneumonia in patient recently
 treated for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a well-circumscribed round
 opacity overlying the left heart border, which is not seen on the lateral view
 and may represent a nipple shadow.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.  
 2.  Ovoid density overlying the left cardiac border, seen only on the PA view,
 likely a nipple shadow.  Repeat films with nipple markers may be obtained for
 further characterization.
