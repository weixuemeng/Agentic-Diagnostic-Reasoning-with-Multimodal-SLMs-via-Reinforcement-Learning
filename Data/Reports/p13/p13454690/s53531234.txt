                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SBO s/p NGT placement  // confirm NG
 location
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of chest CT from
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  An NG tube is present --___ tip extends beneath the
 diaphragm and overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus, beyond the GE
 junction.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No focal consolidation, overt CHF,
 or gross effusion is identified.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle cannot be entirely excluded.  There is linear bibasilar linear
 atelectasis.  The 2 mm nodule identified on the ___ chest CT in the
 right lower lobe is not definitively identified on this examination,
 presumably due to limitations of the modality.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragms.
 
 Incidental note is made of osteopenia, scoliosis and degenerative change the
 thoracic and upper lumbar spine, with mild endplate scalloping of at least two
 mid thoracic vertebral bodies and of severe degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 NG tube tip extends beneath diaphragm in overlies the expected site of the
 gastric fundus.
 
 Left base atelectasis.  No frank consolidation, overt CHF , or gross effusion.
 
 The 2 mm nodule identified on the ___ chest CT in the right lower
 lobe is not definitively identified on this examination, presumably due to
 limitations of the modality.  At the time of that exam, the following was
 recommended: If there are risk factors for malignancy, ___ month follow-up
 chest CT is recommended to evaluate for stability.  In the absence of such
 risk factors, no further follow-up is required.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  The 2 mm nodule identified on the ___ chest CT in
 the right lower lobe is not definitively identified on this examination,
 presumably due to limitations of the modality. At the time of that exam, the
 following was recommended: If there are risk factors for malignancy, ___ month
