                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Large intracranial hemorrhage, assess ET tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable chest radiograph obtained.  The tip of
 the endotracheal tube resides approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The NG
 tube courses into the left upper abdomen, tip excluded from view.  The lungs
 are clear bilaterally.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is widened
 likely secondary to an unfolded thoracic aorta.  Bony structures appear
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned ET and NG tubes.  Widened mediastinal
 contour likely secondary to tortuous thoracic aorta.  Please note in the
 setting of trauma if there is concern for mediastinal hematoma/aortic injury
 CT may be performed to further assess.
