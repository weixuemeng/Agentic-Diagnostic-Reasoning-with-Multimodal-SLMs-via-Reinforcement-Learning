                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Includes lymphoma and possible pneumonitis, crackles at the left
 base and remains reduced diffusing capacity.  Evaluate for infiltrate or
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest.  For right-sided port catheter ends in the lower SVC.  Mainly lower
 lobe reticular interstitial changes are again seen and likely more prominent
 to prior studies.  This may represent a pneumonia in the and/or left lung
 base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increase interstitial opacities at the left lung base, and possibly right lung
 base may represent pneumonia.
