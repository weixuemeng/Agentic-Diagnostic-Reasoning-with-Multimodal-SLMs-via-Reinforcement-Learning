                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent ventilator requirement, fluid overload.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 13:43 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC.  A left subclavian PICC
 line overlies the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with the prior film and allowing for technical differences, there is
 more confluent alveolar opacity in the right mid and upper zones and in the
 left perihilar region.  Again seen are moderate right and small left
 effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Although the current
 film is slightly rotated, the appearance raises the question of diffuse
 narrowing of the left main stem bronchus.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema, slightly worse compared with
 ___.  The possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  
 2) ? mild diffuse narrowing of the left main stem bronchus. Attention to this
 area on followup films is requested.
