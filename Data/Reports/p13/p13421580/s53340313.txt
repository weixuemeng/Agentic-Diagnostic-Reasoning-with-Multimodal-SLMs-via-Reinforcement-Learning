                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions have increased, generally obscuring most of
 both lungs, where it is possible, particularly on the left, there is a large
 pneumonia.  If pleural effusions are not to be drained, I would recommend CT
 scanning to examine the lungs.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is not widened.  ET tube is in standard
 placement, bilateral central venous catheters end in the low SVC and a feeding
 tube passes into the duodenum and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
