                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST 2 VIEW PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left picc eval placement.  // eval picc
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC terminates in the mid to low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Right mid and lower lung areas of atelectasis/ scarring.  Opacity along the
 medial right heart border appears to be due to atelectasis, volume loss
 although underlying consolidation or pulmonary lesion is not excluded.  No
 priors are available for comparison.  Slight blunting of the posterior
 costophrenic angles on the lateral view may be due to trace pleural effusions.
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 calcified and tortuous.
