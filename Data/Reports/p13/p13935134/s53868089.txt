  Interval development of left basilar opacity, likely a combination of pleural
  effusion and atelectasis, however pneumonia could be considered in the
  appropriate clinical setting.  Right mid and lower lung areas of atelectasis
  or scarring appear grossly stable.  Endotracheal tube and left upper extremity
  PICC are in unremarkable position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute dyspnea.  // acute change in
 respiratory status      acute change in respiratory status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and left
 subclavian catheter are in satisfactory position.  Cardiac silhouette is again
 mildly enlarged with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could
 reflect some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the
 bases silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm could reflect small pleural effusion
 and underlying atelectatic changes.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
