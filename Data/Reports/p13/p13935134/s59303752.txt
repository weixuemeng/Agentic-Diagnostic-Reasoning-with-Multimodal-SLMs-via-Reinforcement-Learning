                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PEA arrest s/p ROSC  // Daily CXR for ICU   
 Daily CXR for ICU
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged.  Again the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevation in pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Small effusions and atelectatic change again seen at the
 bases.  However, as on the previous study, the possible superimposition of
 consolidation would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
