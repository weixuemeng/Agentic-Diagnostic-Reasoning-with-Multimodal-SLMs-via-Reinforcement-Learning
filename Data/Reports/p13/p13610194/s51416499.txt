 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fall and left distal clavicle tenderness.
 Please evaluate for rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume but clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 pleural surfaces are normal.  Prominence of both hila is unchanged.  Note is
 made of elevation of the left hilus, likely related to left apical scarring. 
 An ossific density is noted adjacent to the left coracoid process.  A
 well-corticated osseous lesion is noted in the left mid humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute fractures or acute intrathoracic abnormalities noted.
