                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p fall  // r/o fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous with
 calcification of the aortic narrowed.  There is persistent dilatation of the
 left hemidiaphragm.  No definite focal consolidation is identified.  There is
 bibasilar scarring versus atelectasis.  Mitral annular calcifications are
 noted.  On the lateral view, density is seen in the region of the descending
 aorta, more prominent than on prior examination.  This may represent fusiform
 dilatation of the descending aorta.
 
 Lucencies are noted in the region of the bilateral subcutaneous tissues, which
 may be related to overlying material.
 
 A possible fracture is seen of the left lateral fifth rib.  Air-filled colon
 is seen in the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Possible left fifth rib fracture.  Correlation with point tenderness is
 recommended.  Please note that plain chest radiograph is inadequate to assess
 for traumatic injuries of the chest.  If there is persistent concern,
 dedicated films of the ribs can be obtained for better evaluation.
 2.  Possible aneurysmal dilatation of the descending aorta.
