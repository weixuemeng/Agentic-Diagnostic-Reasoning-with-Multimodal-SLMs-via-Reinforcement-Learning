 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, history of smoking, evaluate
 cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Position and diaphragms obscure partially
 the heart silhouette, but significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely.  The
 thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but unchanged in comparison. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on frontal
 view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are grossly within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates in this ___-year-old male patient
 with history of cough.
