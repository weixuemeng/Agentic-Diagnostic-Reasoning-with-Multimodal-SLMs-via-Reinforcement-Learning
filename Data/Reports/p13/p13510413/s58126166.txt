                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis and chills at home.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, four views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly and widening of the thoracic aorta is
 unchanged compared to prior examination.  Correlation to prior CT chest shows
 normal-caliber thoracic aorta and this widened appearance is likely due to
 overlap of the ascending and descending portions.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is plate-like atelectasis in the left lung base.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
