                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F ill-defined abdominal pain please eval for intra-abdominal
 pathology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is
 tortuous but unchanged.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is
 compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy, not substantially changed from the
 previous radiograph.  Multiple nodular opacities are again seen bilaterally,
 but more so within the left mid and lower lung fields, better assessed on the
 previous chest CT.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small
 right pleural effusion which may be chronic.  Minimal atelectasis is noted in
 the lung bases.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules, better
 assessed on the previous CT.  Small right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis without new focal consolidation.
