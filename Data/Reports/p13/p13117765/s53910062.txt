                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs, which are more than expected even
 given slightly lower lung volumes.  There is no effusion or focal
 consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged given
 limitation of patient's rotation to the right.  No acute osseous abnormality
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs may be due
 to mild edema, although atypical infection is also possible.
