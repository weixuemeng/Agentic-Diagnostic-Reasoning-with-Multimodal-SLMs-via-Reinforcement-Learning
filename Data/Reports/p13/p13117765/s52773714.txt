                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with progressive mediastinal adenopathy and lung
 nodule presents with 1 day chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Aorta is mildly
 tortuous. Widening of the mediastinal contour and prominence of the right
 paratracheal stripe is compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy. Several
 scattered nodular opacities are noted within both lungs, most pronounced
 within the left upper lobe, not substantially changed from the prior
 radiograph. Suture material is again demonstrated within the right lower lobe
 with adjacent opacity likely reflecting a combination of postsurgical scarring
 and atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects a
 small pleural effusion, also unchanged. No new focal consolidation is seen.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity likely reflecting a
 combination of atelectasis and postsurgical scarring. Bilateral nodular
 opacities, similar compared to the prior radiograph, and better assessed on
 the prior CT. No new focal consolidation identified. Unchanged widened
 mediastinal contour compatible with lymphadenopathy.
