                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman postoperative day 3 after VATS, right upper lobe
 wedge resection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary edema present on ___ is nearly entirely resolved.  There is
 still a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and the combination of
 residual edema and pleural fluid may account for increasing opacity in the
 right lower lobe laterally.  Alternatively, I recommend careful followup to
 exclude developing concurrent pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Left lung is clear of any focal abnormality.
