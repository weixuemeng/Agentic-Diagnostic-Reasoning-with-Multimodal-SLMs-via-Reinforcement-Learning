                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left-sided chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the prior study, hazy and nodular opacities have markedly
 improved, although there is persistent but decreased posterior right basilar
 opacification with blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus and so probably a
 pleural effusion.  There is no definite pleural effusion on the left.  The
 heart size appears reduced.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked interval improvement in multifocal lung opacities. 
 Although a superimposed acute process in the right lower lobe is difficult to
 exclude, the latter is probably a more chronic appearance.
