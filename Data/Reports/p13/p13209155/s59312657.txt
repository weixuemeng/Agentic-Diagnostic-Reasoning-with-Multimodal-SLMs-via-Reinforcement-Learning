                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with productive cough (would cancel the prior
 pa/ lateral one but not available as option)  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest and chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There are streaky bibasilar opacities and patchy retrocardiac opacity.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and a trace left pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Compression deformity of T11 appears similar to ___.  Compression
 deformity of L1 is age-indeterminate.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.  Surgical clips are again seen in the right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral streaky and patchy opacities likely represent atelectasis, but in
 the appropriate clinical setting, patchy retrocardiac opacity could represent
 very early pneumonia.
 2. Compression deformity of L1 is age-indeterminate.
