  Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle, potentially atelectasis
  versus pleural scarring.
  Retrocardiac opacity which could potentially be infection in the proper
  clinical setting.
  Proximal right humerus fracture as seen on recent shoulder films.  Lower
  thoracic and upper lumbar compression deformities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest pain  // ? mass, consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Correlation made to shoulder films from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to pleural
 thickening or small effusion.  In addition, on the lateral view there is
 increased opacity projecting over the posterior costophrenic angles,
 potentially localizing to the left lower lobe on the frontal view.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Proximal right
 humerus fracture is as seen on recent shoulder x-rays.  Compression
 deformities of several lower thoracic/upper lumbar vertebral bodies are noted.
 Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
