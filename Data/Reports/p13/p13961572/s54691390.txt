 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 No priors for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 allowing for relatively low lung volumes.  Lungs are grossly clear.  Minimal
 blunting of left posterior costophrenic sulcus is present on lateral view. 
 Pleural surfaces are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable small left pleural effusion vs. pleural thickening. 
 Otherwise, unremarkable radiograph.
