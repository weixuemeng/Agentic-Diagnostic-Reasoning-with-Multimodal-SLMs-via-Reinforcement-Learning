                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall and seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  There is mild
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  There is a 5 mm nodular density projecting
 over the left lower costophrenic sulcus, suggestive of a calcified granuloma
 or perhaps a nodular appearance of atelectasis but not fully characterized.  A
 small equivocal nodule is also present at the right lung base.  Otherwise, the
 lungs appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the lower
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the left costophrenic sulcus and an
 equivocal right basilar nodule.  Correlation with prior radiographs is
 suggested if available.  When clinically feasible, repeat PA and lateral chest
 radiographs including a view with better coverage of the left costophrenic
 sulcus is suggested; chest CT could be considered based on the results
 particularly if prior comparisons are not available.
