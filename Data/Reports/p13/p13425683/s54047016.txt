                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postop day 2 with oxygen requirement and productive cough, question
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.  
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms and obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic consolidation.  Otherwise, no
 focal infiltrate or consolidation.  No CHF or gross effusion.
