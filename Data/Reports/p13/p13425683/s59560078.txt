 INDICATION:  Weakness and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A previously seen retrocardiac opacity is improved on this
 examination.  No new focal parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There may be mild vascular
 congestion, however, no frank pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is
 accentuated by AP technique and likely at the upper limits of normal.  A
 ureteral stent is partially imaged.
