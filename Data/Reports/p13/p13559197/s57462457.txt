                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with acute desaturation.  Evaluate for
 acute process - pneumonia, effusion, etc.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 dated ___.  High positioned diaphragms indicate poor
 inspirational effort.  Its size cannot be assessed with certainty as contours
 are obscured.  No significant interval change has occurred in comparison with
 the next preceding study.  The pulmonary vasculature again shows a moderate
 degree of perivascular haze consistent with the impression of congestion.  The
 image does not cover entirely the lateral pleural sinuses but there is no
 suggestion of any increased pleural effusion in comparison with the previous
 study.  No new infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings as can be identified on portable single AP
 chest examination.
