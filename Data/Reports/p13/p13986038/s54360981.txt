 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiogenic and septic shock, evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change seen. 
 The lung volumes remain low.  The diameter of the vascular structures is at
 the upper range of normal, potentially suggesting mild fluid overload.  No
 areas of parenchymal opacities or consolidations suggestive of pneumonia.  No
 larger pleural effusions.
