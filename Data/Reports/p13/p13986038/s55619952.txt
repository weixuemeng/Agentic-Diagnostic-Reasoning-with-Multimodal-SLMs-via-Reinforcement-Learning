                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of congestive heart failure with shortness of breath and
 new crackles on exam.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and right
 basilar atelectasis, very similar to the prior exam.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous with calcifications
 at the arch.  The heart size is normal.  Again, there are post-surgical
 changes from a prior CABG.  The first and third most superior sternal wires
 are broken, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
