                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with hypotension.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable views of the chest.  Extremely low lung volumes are
 seen with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is again seen.  Linear right basilar opacities, potentially
 atelectasis versus scarring, unchanged.  There is no definite superimposed
 consolidation or large effusion.  Degree of cardiomegaly has likely not
 changed given differences in technique and positioning.  Fractured first and
 third from the top sternal wires are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without definite superimposed acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
