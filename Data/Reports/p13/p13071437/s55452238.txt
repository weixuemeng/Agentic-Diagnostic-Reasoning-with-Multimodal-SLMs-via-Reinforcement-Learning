                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Reported palpitations with administration of fluid and flushing of
 the Hickman line.  Confirm line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show a right
 subclavian central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the high right
 atrium.  This is unchanged since ___.  Otherwise, the lung volumes have
 improved since the prior study and the lungs are clear.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  No pleural abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of the Hickman catheter is in the high right atrium, 2.5 cm
 below the cavoatrial junction. If the patient continues to be symptomatic, and
 the catheter can be pulled back, it should be pulled back by 2.5 cm for
 placement in the low SVC.
