 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, atrial fibrillation, evaluation for amiodarone toxicity.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Also unchanged is the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette and the
 massive tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  In addition, the mild pleural
 thickening at the lateral aspects of the right lung base are also constant. 
 The lateral radiograph displays minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung
 areas but no signs of pulmonary fibrosis.  Large perihilar vessels indicate
 mild and probably chronic fluid overload.  An apparently normal contour of the
 seventh right rib is caused by the inferior angle of the scapula.
 
 No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.
