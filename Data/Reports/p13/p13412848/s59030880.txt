 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to prior, there has been no significant interval change.  Severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the descending
 thoracic aorta is again noted.  Vague right basilar opacity is unchanged from
 prior exam and may be due to atelectasis in setting of low lung volumes. 
 There is no overt edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volume with right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  No definite
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
