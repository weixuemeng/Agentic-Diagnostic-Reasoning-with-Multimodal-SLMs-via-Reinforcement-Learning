                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and atrial fibrillation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left.  This is obscures the cardiac silhouette making assessment of the
 cardiac silhouette size difficult.  The patient is somewhat rotated.  There is
 diffuse calcification of the trachea and bronchi.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen.  No pneumothorax is clearly present.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration
 are not completely excluded.  Moderate cervical lumbar spine, convex to the
 right is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat limited study due to patient rotation.  Small to moderate size
 bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis.  Infection and aspiration at the lung bases however
 cannot be excluded.
