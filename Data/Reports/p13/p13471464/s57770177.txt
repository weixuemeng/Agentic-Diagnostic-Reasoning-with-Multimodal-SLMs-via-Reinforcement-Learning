                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation. The patient is status post
 median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve repair.  The right internal jugular
 central venous catheter has been removed.  Heart size appears unchanged. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are again noted, and appears slightly increased in size on the right
 compared to the previous exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 compressive atelectasis.  Previously demonstrated biapical small
 pneumothoraces are no longer appreciated.  Scarring within the lung apices are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions,
 perhaps minimally increased on the right compared to the previous exam, with
 persistent bibasilar atelectasis.  Previously noted tiny apical pneumothoraces
 are no longer appreciated.
