                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure, intubated at outside
 hospital  // ?consolidation, effusions, ET placement      ?consolidation,
 effusions, ET placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 14:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 21:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. The right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial
 junction. The pulmonary vasculature is now indistinct suggesting interval
 appearance of mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable given differences in technique. No large effusions.
 Retrocardiac opacity may reflect a small hiatal hernia or possibly
 atelectasis.  This can be better assessed on followup imaging.
