                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Prior right central venous catheter is no longer visualized.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Linear opacity in the right midlung is suggestive of atelectasis. 
 Additional left basilar, retrocardiac opacity is also likely atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable given lower lung volumes. No acute
 osseous abnormality.  Anterior compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged.  IVC filter is partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis in setting of low lung volumes,
 however infection is not entirely excluded.
