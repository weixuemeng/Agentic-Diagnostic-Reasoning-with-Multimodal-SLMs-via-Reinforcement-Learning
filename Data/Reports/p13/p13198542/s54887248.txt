                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ALL. BMT, HVGD,  wheezing, right basilar crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A patchy right middle lobe opacity is new since ___ with
 a somewhat linear configuration on the lateral view.  The left lung is clear. 
 The cardiac, hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Trace right pleural
 effusion is present. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Although a new right middle lobe opacity appears somewhat linear
 on the lateral view thereby suggesting atelectasis, the patchy ill-defined
 appearance on the frontal view is non-specific, and pneumonia should be
 considered in this immunocompromised patient. Trace right pleural effusion.
