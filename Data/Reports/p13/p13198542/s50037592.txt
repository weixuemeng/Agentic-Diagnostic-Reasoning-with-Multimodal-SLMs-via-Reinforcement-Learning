                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up right lower lobe opacity. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___ and CT
 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 On the frontal projection, the right lower lobe appears to be better aerated
 and the previous identified opacity is lower less conspicuous, although there
 is no lateral projection for comparison.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  The
 remainder of the lungs are essentially clear without pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly is noted.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Somewhat improved aeration of the right lower lobe, although the difference in
 radiographic techniques and the lack of the lateral projection makes the
 comparison difficult.
