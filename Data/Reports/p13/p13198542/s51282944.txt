                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ___ pneumonia, question worsening
 infiltrates.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 505.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 146 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Since the previous study, there has been interval appearance of patchy
 opacities in the left mid lateral lung, left base, right upper, and right mid
 lungs as well as interval progression of a patchy opacity at the right lung
 base.  These findings would be concerning for multifocal pneumonia rather than
 atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain low.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
