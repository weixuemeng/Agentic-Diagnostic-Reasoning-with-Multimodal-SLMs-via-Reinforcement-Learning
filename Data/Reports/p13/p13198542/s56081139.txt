                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia after transplant.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the opacification at the right
 base has substantially decreased.  Continued low lung volumes.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the
 right.
