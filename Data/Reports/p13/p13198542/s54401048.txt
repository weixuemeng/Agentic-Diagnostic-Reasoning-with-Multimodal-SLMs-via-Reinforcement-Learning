 INDICATION:   ___M with GVHD and respiratory distress  // evaluate for
 pulmonary congestion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are extremely low limiting evaluation.  There secondary crowding
 of the bronchovascular markings and streaky left basilar opacities which are
 likely atelectasis.  .  There may be superimposed pulmonary edema although
 detailed evaluation is very limited.  Additional right basilar opacity could
 represent atelectasis although effusion or infection would be difficult to
 exclude.  Left PICC is noted although the tip is not clearly delineated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam due to low lung volumes.  Possible superimposed pulmonary edema
 and right basilar opacity which could represent any combination of
 atelectasis, effusion or consolidation.
