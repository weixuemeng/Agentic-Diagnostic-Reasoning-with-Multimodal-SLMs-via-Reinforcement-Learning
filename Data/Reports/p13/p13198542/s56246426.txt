                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORTABLE PICC LINE PLACEMENT
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with GVHD, pneumonia, CHF  // interval change,
 PICC position      interval change, PICC position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 Lung volumes are very low, mildly improved since ___.  Right lower lobe is
 substantially atelectatic.  Dense consolidation in the left lower lobe could
 be atelectasis also, unchanged, but pneumonia is a possibility.  Cardiac
 silhouette and mediastinal veins are mildly enlarged, but there is no
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Left PIC line passes into the right atrium, but the tip is indistinct.
 Conventional radiographs will probably be required for localization.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 Conventional radiographs will probably be required for PICC localization.
