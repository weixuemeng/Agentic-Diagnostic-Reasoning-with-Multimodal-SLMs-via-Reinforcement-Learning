 heart is mildly enlarged.  There small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 pulmonary vascular redistribution but the hazy alveolar infiltrate has
 decreased.  However there are dense areas of opacification both lower lobes. 
 It is unclear how much of this is due to volume loss or if focal infectious
 infiltrates are present.
