                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hepatic abscess.  Decreased breath sounds.
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study performed eight hours earlier.
 
 Large right effusion is probably unchanged allowing difference in positioning
 of the patient.  Large right lower consolidation is stable.  This is likely
 atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Minimal left
 lower atelectasis have minimally increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal.
