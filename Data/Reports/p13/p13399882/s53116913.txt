                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute decompensation and respiratory status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again demonstrated is stable extensive
 parenchymal consolidation, which may represent pulmonary edema with
 superimposed pneumonia. There is stable appearance of a left pacemaker with
 tips terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Stable radiographic appearance of extensive bilateral parenchymal
 consolidations, which may represent pulmonary edema with superimposed
 pneumonia. However, other etiologies such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,
 eosinophilic pneumonia, or hemorrhage may also account for this appearance.
