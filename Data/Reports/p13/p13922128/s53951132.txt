 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is a rounded opacity in the left mid lung,
 which is not clearly visualized on the lateral, but may project over the
 spine.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no effusion or pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung, potentially
 within the lower lobe.  Nonurgent chest CT suggested to further characterize.
