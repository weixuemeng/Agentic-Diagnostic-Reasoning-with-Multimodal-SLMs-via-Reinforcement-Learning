                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with s/p fall  // fx?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are clear bilaterally.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Overall appearance of
 the chest is similar to prior study dated ___.  Probable calcified
 granuloma projects over the left midlung zone.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.  Known proximal right
 humerus fracture is better evaluated on concurrent shoulder films.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall stable appearance of the chest without a displaced rib fracture
 identified.  If clinical concern persists, dedicated rib views with radiopaque
 marker indicating site of concern is advised.  Known proximal right humerus
 fracture is better seen on dedicated films performed the same day.
