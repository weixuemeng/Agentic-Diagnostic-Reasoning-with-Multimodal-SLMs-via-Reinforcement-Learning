 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pulmonary fibrosis and infection vs edema.
 Eval for interval change.  // interval change     interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved, background density of the lungs has decreased
 substantially and caliber of the mediastinal vasculature is decreased all
 pointing to the resolution of pulmonary edema superimposed on severe pulmonary
 fibrosis.  Given the rapid change and the absence of any consolidation, there
 is no reason to suspect pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion.
