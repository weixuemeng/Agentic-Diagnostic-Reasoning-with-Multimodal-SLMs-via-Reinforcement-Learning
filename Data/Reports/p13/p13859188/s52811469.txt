                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath on BiPAP. Evaluate for effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT ___ 22:03.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Diffuse interstitial changes with honeycombing,
 predominating the lower lung zones, are better seen on the recent chest CT. 
 There is superimposed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are presumed.  The heart size is difficult to assess given
 the diffuse parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The
 distribution of fibrosis raises the possibility of UIP.
