                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  There is a small right pleural effusion, similar
 in size compared to the previous exam.  Previously noted small left pleural
 effusion appears resolved.  Minimal linear and streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 are demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and small right pleural effusion,
 unchanged compared to the previous exam.  Previously noted small left pleural
 effusion has resolved.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
