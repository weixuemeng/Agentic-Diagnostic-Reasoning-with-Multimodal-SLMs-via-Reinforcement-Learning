                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-op day #1 status post liver transplant, here to evaluate for
 interval change in pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient has been extubated and the enteric tube has been removed. 
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with
 the Swan-___ catheter again seen extending beyond the desired margins of the
 mediastinum.  There is decreased right apical capping, but persistent layering
 of a moderate right pleural effusion from ___.  There is no definitive
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Right basilar atelectasis is increased from
 ___.  Retrocardiac opacification compatible with left lower lobe
 atelectasis is unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Swan-Ganz catheter still extends beyond the mediastinum.
 2.  Layering moderate right pleural effusion and increased right basilar
 atelectasis.
 3.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
