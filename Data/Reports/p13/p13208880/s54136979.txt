                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, headstrike. Recently treated for
 pneumonia last week, crackles bilateral lung bases. Constipation worsening for
 several days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are similar on the
 right, and slightly worse on the left, and may reflect areas of atelectasis,
 though infection or aspiration in the left lung base is not excluded.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no focal consolidation. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, slightly worse on the left compared to
 the prior study, which may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded.
