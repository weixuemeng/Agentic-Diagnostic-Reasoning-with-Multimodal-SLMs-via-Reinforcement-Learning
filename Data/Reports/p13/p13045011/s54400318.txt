                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with possible seizure.  Assess for pneumonia and ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 2.5 cm
 above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach.  Low lung
 volumes.  Retrocardiac opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Right lung
 base opacity is also noted.   No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart size is normal. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is notable for
 air-filled prominent stomach and bowel loops.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities, likely reflect atelectasis.
