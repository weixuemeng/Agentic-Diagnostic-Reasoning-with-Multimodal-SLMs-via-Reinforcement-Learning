                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with vented, hypoxia.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is nearly total opacification of both lungs.  Cardiac size is
 normal.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely secondary to
 positioning to supine position. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions are seen.
 
 An endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube has its
 tip and side port within the stomach.  A line crossing across the left upper
 lung with its tip projecting over the cardiac shadow is likely external.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Total opacification of both lungs, compatible with diffuse
 airspace filling, most likely edema.
