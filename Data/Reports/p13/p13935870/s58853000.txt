                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with L effusion, s/p pigtail placement  // eval for
 CT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 08:22.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter, which
 appears coiled overlying the left lower lobe.  A left side hydropneumothorax
 with adjacent atelectasis has decreased in size, now moderate.  The upper left
 lung and right lung are grossly clear.  There is no evidence of large
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely visualized
 secondary to the pleural effusion, but appears grossly unchanged from the
 prior examination.  Asymmetric opacity overlying the first costochondral
 joint, may be degenerative versus overlying lung nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Placement of a pigtail catheter in the lower left hemi thorax with interval
 decrease in size of a now moderate left hydropneumothorax.
 2.  Opacity overlying left first costochondral joint may represent asymmetric
 degenerative changes versus pulmonary nodule.  Recommend CT chest for further
 evaluation.
