                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new chest tube  // confirm placement and
 eval for PTX      confirm placement and eval for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right pigtail pleural drainage catheter projects over the right lower
 chest.  Previous small right pleural effusion is smaller and there is no
 obvious pneumothorax.
 
 Widespread interstitial pulmonary abnormality has probably improved, but the
 presence of both bronchial cuffing and small nodular opacities is concerning
 for disseminated malignancy or infection.  Moderate left pleural effusion has
 increased since ___ and now occupies the previous air-filled left apical
 pleural space.  Distortion of mediastinal contours particularly the aortic
 arch suggest adenopathy.  Left pleural drainage catheter unchanged in
 position, entering inferiorly and projecting over the left lower chest.
