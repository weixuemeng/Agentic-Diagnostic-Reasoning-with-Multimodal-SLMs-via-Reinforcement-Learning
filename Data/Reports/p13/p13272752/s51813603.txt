                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, known lung CA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath terminates in the proximal to mid SVC.  Interval increase in
 well left hemi thorax opacity worrisome for progression of known metastatic
 disease and increase in left hydrothorax, with more fluid at the left apex,
 and with small pneumothorax remaining.  There are innumerable nodular
 opacities bilaterally consistent with extensive metastatic disease and
 lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Spiculated opacity in the left juxta hilar
 region likely corresponds to patient's mass, concern for increase size since
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive pulmonary metastatic disease, progressed.  Interval increase in
 pleural fluid at the left lung apex with small pneumothorax remaining.
