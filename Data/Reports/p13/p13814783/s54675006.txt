                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Postoperative leukocytosis. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 13:33.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and a retrocardiac opacity,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse.  This is similar to the prior exam. 
 There is a small left pleural effusion only appreciated on the lateral view.
 The right lung is essentially clear. There is no right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  Noted are prominent air-filled loops of bowel in the
 upper abdomen, which are only partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 3:25 AM, 2 minutes after discovery of the
