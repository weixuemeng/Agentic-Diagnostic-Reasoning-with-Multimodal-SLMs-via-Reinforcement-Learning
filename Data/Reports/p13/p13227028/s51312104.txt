 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged

 scattered atherosclerotic calcifications within the thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Minimal linear
 opacities in both lung bases may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Partially imaged are bilateral
 humeral head prostheses.

 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
