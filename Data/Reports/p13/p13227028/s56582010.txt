 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Focal opacities over the right posterior third rib are
 consistent with bone islands and were present since ___.  Hyperlucency of the
 apices with attenuation of the vessels is suggestive of emphysema.  Left lower
 lobe atelectasis is unchanged; otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The aorta is tortuous and
 contains calcifications.  Heart size is normal.  Bilateral humeral head
 prostheses are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Hyperlucency of the apices with attenuation of vessels is suggestive of
 emphysema.
