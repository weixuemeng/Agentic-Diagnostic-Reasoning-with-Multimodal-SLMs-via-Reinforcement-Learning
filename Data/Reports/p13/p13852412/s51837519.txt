                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cocaine and heroin use with chest pain and shortness of breath for
 one day.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank
 interstitial edema.  There are scattered, vague areas of increased
 interstitial marking slightly changed in morphology since prior exam.  There
 is otherwise no dense consolidation.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without interstitial
 edema but with scattered areas of new interstitial abnormality of unclear
 significance, could be due to acute or chronic reaction to inhaled or injected
 materials.  No dense consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
