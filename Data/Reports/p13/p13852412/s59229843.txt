                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Again seen are retrocardiac
 opacities, which are unchanged.  This may represent pneumonia in a correct
 clinical setting.  No other focal consolidations are seen.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left retrocardiac basilar opacities, which may
 represent pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to resolution.
