                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to exam from two days prior there has been clearing of
 some of the areas of vague opacity.  On today's study there is increased
 bronchial cuffing and narrowing of bronchial lumens.  Heart size is normal
 with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  Mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement without frank interstitial edema persists.  There is no dense
 consolidation.  Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval clearing of some of the areas of vague opacity but now
 with increased bronchial cuffing and narrow lumens suggestive of bronchospasm.
 No pneumonia or edema.
