                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Completed antibiotic course for pneumonia with worsening lung
 sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is ill-defined opacification involving the right lower lobe,
 which would be compatible with pneumonia.  Given the lack of comparison
 studies; however, it is impossible to determine whether this represents
 radiologic lag of a prior consolidation, a new consolidation or recurrence. 
 The remaining lungs are clear.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe.  The
 chronicity is unknown.  The prior pneumonia has not been specified as to
 location and as such is impossible to determine whether this represents
 radiologic lag of a previously diagnosed pneumonia, recurrent pneumonia, or
 possibly a chronic airspace process in which case a more detailed evaluation
 should be performed. Correlate clinically.  If prior studies cannot be
 obtained, to aid in the comparison, CT scan may be advised.
