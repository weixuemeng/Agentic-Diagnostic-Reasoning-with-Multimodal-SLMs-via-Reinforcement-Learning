                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness, nausea, and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  
 
 A calcified nodular opacity overlying the left lower lung field is consistent
 with a calcified granuloma and is better seen on CT performed in ___. 
 A hazy opacity over the left lung base is most likely due to overlying
 gynecomastia; otherwise, the lung fields are clear bilaterally with no focal
 consolidation or nodules.  
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 There are atherosclerotic calcifications in the aorta.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal in size.  Surgical clips in the left neck and sternal
 fixation wires are consistent with prior median sternotomy.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
