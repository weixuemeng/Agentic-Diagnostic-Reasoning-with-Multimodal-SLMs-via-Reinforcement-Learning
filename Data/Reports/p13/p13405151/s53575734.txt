                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA and LATERAL CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Slight
 improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and decrease in extent of
 interstitial edema with mild residual edema remaining.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion with loculated intrafissural component appears similar to the prior
 study, and a small left pleural effusion is also not appreciably changed. 
 Bibasilar areas of atelectasis have slightly improved, however.  Small left
 apical pneumothorax is unchanged, and there is also a questionable tiny right
 apical pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving interstitial edema and decreased bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  Unchanged small left apical pneumothorax.  Probable tiny right apical
 pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
