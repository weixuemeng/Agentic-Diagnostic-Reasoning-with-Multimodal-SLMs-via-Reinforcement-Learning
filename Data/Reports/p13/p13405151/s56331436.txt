 mediastinal shift.  Dense pericardial calcification is best visualized on
 lateral view.  A left-sided single-lead ICD is unchanged in position. 
 Compared to earlier examination, there has been worsening of central vascular
 congestion and interstitial edema.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
