                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p appendectomy  // acute change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube tip is in the stomach but the side hole is at the GE
 junction.  Allowing for the AP technique and patient rotation,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is bandlike atelectasis
 at the right base.  The lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Free intraperitoneal air under the left hemidiaphragm is likely related to
 recent surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No consolidation or pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Free air under the left hemidiaphragm is likely related to recent
 abdominal surgery.
