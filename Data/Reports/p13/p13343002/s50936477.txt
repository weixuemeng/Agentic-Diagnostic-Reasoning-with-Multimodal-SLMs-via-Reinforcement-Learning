  Right base opacity may be due to consolidation from infection or aspiration.
  
  Slight blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle most likely due to
  pleural thickening rather than trace pleural effusion.
  
  Prominence of the main pulmonary arteries suggests component of pulmonary
  arterial hypertension.  Slightly prominent AP window could be due to prominent
  pulmonary artery, however, underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded. 
  Consider follow-up nonurgent chest CT for further assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patchy right base opacity is seen which could be due to infection, aspiration,
 or atelectasis.  There is blunting of the posterior left costophrenic angle
 which may be due to pleural thickening, less likely trace pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged.  There is slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery which may
 be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Slight prominence
 of the AP window may be due to prominent pulmonary artery however, underlying
 lymphadenopathy not excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
