 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There are heterogeneous opacities in bilateral lung bases left
 greater than right with posterobasal correlate on lateral view with
 peribronchial cuffing suspicious for infection or possibly aspiration.  The
 upper lung fields are clear.  The right costophrenic sulcus is not imaged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A rounded density projecting
 over the GE junction is likely a small hiatal hernia.

 1.  Left-greater-than-right bibasilar opacities with peribronchial cuffing
 suspicious for infection or aspiration.
 
 2.  Possible hiatal hernia
