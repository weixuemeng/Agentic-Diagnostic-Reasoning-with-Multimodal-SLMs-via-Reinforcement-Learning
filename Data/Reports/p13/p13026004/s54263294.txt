                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion in the setting of copd  // eval for
 pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Relative increase in opacity over the right
 hemi thorax as compared to the left may be due to decrease volume of the right
 lung as well as potentially overlying soft tissue.  The left lung appears to
 contain greater volume than the right.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs, consistent with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.
