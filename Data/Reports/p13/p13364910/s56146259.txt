 below the diaphragms, and terminates in the fundus of the stomach.  Bilateral
 airspace consolidations compatible with pneumonia are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube could be retracted 2 cm for ideal positioning.
 
 2.  NG tube in appropriate position.
 
 3.  Multifocal airspace consolidations, as seen previously.
