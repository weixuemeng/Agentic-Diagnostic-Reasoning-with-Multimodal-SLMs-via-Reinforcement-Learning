                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with multifocal pneumonia, intubated.  Evaluate
 interval change in pnuemonia and confirm ET tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 terminates within stomach.  There is an abdominal surgical drain entering the
 field of view from the inferior aspect of the image.  A right internal jugular
 central venous line terminates near the cavoatrial junction.
 
 Multifocal large airspace opacities persist.  The consolidation in the right
 lung is more confluent than on the prior study. There is a new left perihilar
 opacity.  A large retrocardiac opacity is unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no significant pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube positioning as above.
 2. Interval worsening of mulifocal pneumonia with more confluent appearance of
 right lung consolidation and new left perihilar airspace consolidation.
