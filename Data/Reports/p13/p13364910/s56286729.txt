                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest obtained earlier
 this morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate more
 confluent appearance of previously identified right upper, right lower, and
 left lower lobe opacities, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No large
 pleural effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  More conspicuous consolidations compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia since the recent prior study from 10:26 a.m. this morning.  IV
 hydration may contribute to radiographic changes.
