                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach here for peritonitis s/p ex-lap  //
 ?worsening pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are again low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and causing
 some bronchovascular crowding.  Side port of the NG tube is below the GE
 junction.  Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.  Right basilar atelectasis has
 improved since prior.  Retrocardiac opacity has also improved since prior.
 There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous structures are intact. 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar atelectasis has improved since prior.  Retrocardiac opacity,
 which likely represents atelectasis and possibly a component of pneumonia,
 also appears slightly improved compared to prior.
