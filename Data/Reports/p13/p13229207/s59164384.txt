 PNA - please obtain on ___ AM
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little change in the
 monitoring and support devices.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  The pulmonary vessels are somewhat
 indistinct, suggesting some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle is seen, which could reflect a small pleural
 effusion.
