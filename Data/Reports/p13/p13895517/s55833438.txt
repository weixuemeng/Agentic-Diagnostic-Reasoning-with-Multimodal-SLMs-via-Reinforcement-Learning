  1. Retrocardiac opacification is likely a combination of pleural effusion and
  compressive atelectasis.  Superimposed consolidation is possible in the proper
  clinical setting.
  2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm the carina with apparent mild
  overinflation of the endotracheal balloon.
  3. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion mild associated interstitial
  edema.
  4. Apparent fullness of the left hilum may be related to volume loss due to
  effusion and atelectasis.

  clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with bradycardia, hypotsnsion, evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable supine view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm from the carina with distension of the
 mid trachea suggesting mild hyperinflation of endotracheal tube balloon.  An
 enteric tube courses below the diaphragm outside of the field of view.  A
 coronary stent projects heart.
 
 Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is associated with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Left retrocardiac opacification likely
 represents a combination of effusion and compressive atelectasis.  A faint
 nodular opacity in the left upper lung adjacent to a rounded structure
 external to the patient is likely due to overlapping densities of the ribs at
 this level.  Attention on followup is recommended.
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous structures and upper abdomen are
 unremarkable.  Dense calcification of the aortic arch is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacification is likely a combination of pleural effusion and
 compressive atelectasis.  Superimposed consolidation is possible in the proper
 clinical setting.
 2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm the carina with apparent mild
 overinflation of the endotracheal balloon.
 3. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion mild associated interstitial
 edema.
