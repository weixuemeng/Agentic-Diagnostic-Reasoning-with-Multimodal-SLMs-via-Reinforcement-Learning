 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:29 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right lung shows no
 relevant change.  On the left, there is increasing atelectasis, notably at the
 left lung bases and, potentially, occurrence of a small left pleural effusion.
 The tip of the left PICC line is difficult to visualize but could still be
 malpositioned.  The re-position is required.  The other monitoring and support
 devices are constant.  The overall size of the cardiac silhouette is also
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
