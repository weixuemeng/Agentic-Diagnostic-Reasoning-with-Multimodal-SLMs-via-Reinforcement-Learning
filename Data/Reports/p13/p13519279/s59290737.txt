                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with O2 sat low ___'s tachycardic s/p
 laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer  // please eval for e/o
 consolidation, effusion, pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Suboptimal inspiratory effort and AP position complicates interpretation of
 the radiograph.  Apparent cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary vascular
 markings may be technical in nature.  Mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Normal diaphragmatic contour.  No airspace consolidation. No
 pleural effusion.  No suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No airspace consolidation.
 There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but the diaphragm has maintained
 its normal contour and I think a subpulmonic effusion is unlikely.
