                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited due to low inspiratory lung volumes and patient rotation. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.   Low lung volumes
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely borderline
 enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary
 edema is noted.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality seen.  Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral
 joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient rotation.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis, but would recommend repeat PA and lateral radiographs
 with improved inspiratory effort when the patient is able to for further
 assessment of the lung bases.
