                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line has been discontinued.  There is no change in
 low lung volumes, bibasilar consolidations, bilateral pleural effusions, left
 more than right.  There is no evidence of overt edema, but mild vascular
 engorgement cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
