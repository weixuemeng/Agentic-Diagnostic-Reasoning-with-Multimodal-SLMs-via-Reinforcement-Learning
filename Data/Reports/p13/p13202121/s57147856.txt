                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with Port-A-Cath, chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A
 left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with catheter terminating in the distal SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are small areas of mild linear
 opacity at the left lung base which may relate to atelectasis, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting, early infectious process is not excluded.  The
 right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC.  A few subtle
 linear areas of opacity at the left lung base most likely atelectasis, early
 infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
