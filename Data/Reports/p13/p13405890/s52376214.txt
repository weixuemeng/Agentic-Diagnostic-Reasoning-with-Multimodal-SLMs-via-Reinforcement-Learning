                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, wheezing and shortness of breath
 who presents for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There appears to be a new left lower lobe focal opacity compared to
 the prior exam. This could be secondary to CHF exacerbation, or atelectasis,
 however an infiltrative process cannot be ruled out.  The bilateral pleural
 effusions appear to be stable.  The heart size is stable compared to the prior
 exam.  There again appears to be mild cardiac congestion with mild
 cephalization of the pulmonary vessels.  The aorta appears to be tortuous.
 
 CONCLUSION:  New left lower lobe focal opacification. This could be consistent
 with a CHF exacerbation or atelectasis, however an infectious process cannot
 be ruled out.
