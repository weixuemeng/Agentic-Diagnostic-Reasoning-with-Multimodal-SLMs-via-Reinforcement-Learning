                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged.  The aortic knob is heavily
 calcified.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is worse in the interval with new
 bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the left and small on the
 right.  No large pneumothorax is demonstrated though assessment of the left
 apex is somewhat obscured by external devices.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect areas of compressive atelectasis.  Superior subluxation of both
 humeral heads with narrowed acromiohumeral intervals indicate rotator cuff
 disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval with small to moderate
 left and small right pleural effusions, new in the interval. Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
