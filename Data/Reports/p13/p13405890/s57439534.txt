                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypotension; evaluate for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semierect AP chest radiograph views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Right shoulder radiograph
 dated ___.  Left shoulder radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion appears to have resolved.  Perhaps minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Otherwise, no significant change from the prior
 exam.  There may be trace persistent right pleural effusion.  Bilateral
 atelectasis persists.   No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or overt
 pulmonary edema. Stable prominent cardiomegaly.  Stable calcification of the
 aortic arch.  Stable mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 Bilateral narrowing of the AC joint and high-riding humerus as well as
 heterotopic ossification superolateral to the right humeral head, suggesting
 chronic rotator cuff tear and severe osteoarthritis/post-trauma changes, are
 overall similar to prior shoulder radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval resolution of small left pleural effusion; persistent probable
 trace right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral atelectasis.
 
 3.  No focal consolidation or frank pulmonary edema.
