                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with Wegener's granulomatosis, referred for
 followup of right pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 Large right pleural effusion is unchanged in size.  There is associated right
 basilar atelectasis/scarring, also stable.  Healed right rib fractures are
 noted.  On the left, there is persistent apical pleural thickening and apical
 scarring.  Linear opacities projecting over the lower lobe are also compatible
 with scarring, unchanged.  There is no left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess,
 but appear unchanged.  Vascular stent is seen in the left axillary/subclavian
 region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right pleural effusion.  Stable multifocal scarring and
 left apical pleural thickening.
