                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia persistent right pleural effusion, now worsening
 tachypnea and heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 REPORT:  Pulmonary hyperinflation is noted.  There is a right-sided pleural
 effusion which is moderate which may have a loculated component.  Multiple rib
 fractures on the right side is seen.  There are biapical fibrocalcific changes
 with definite evidence of some volume loss, and likely scarring.  There is
 some tracheal dilatation also which may be tractional.  In addition to this,
 there is some superimposed likely pulmonary edema just change.  There is
 sparing of the left base.
 
 
 COINCLUSION
 
 Pulmonary edema superimposed on background chronic biapical fibrocalcific
 process.  Effusion and atelectasis in the right base.  The overall appearances
 are probably little improved from prior study.
