                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A moderate-sized, loculated right pleural
 effusion is similar when compared to the prior study, though a small left
 pleural effusion appears to be new in the interval.  Again demonstrated is
 volume loss in the left lung with leftward shift of mediastinal structures and
 unchanged architectural distortion, bronchiectasis, and pleural thickening
 involving the left upper lobe.  Right basilar hazy opacity likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis.  Streaky opacity within the left lung base may also
 reflect an area of atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged moderate loculated right pleural effusion, with new small left
 pleural effusion.
 2.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
 3.  Evidence of prior granulomatous infection.
