                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to be further
 increase in the substantial right pleural effusion.  There is evidence of
 compressive atelectasis at the base.  Some opacification just above the level
 of the effusion on the frontal view could possibly be a manifestation of
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Remainder of this study is unchanged.
