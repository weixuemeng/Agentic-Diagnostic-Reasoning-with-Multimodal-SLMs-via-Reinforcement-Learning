                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic effusions, left sided rales, resolving pneumonia clinically.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, at 17:02 p.m., the radiographic appearance is stable.
 Again seen is background COPD, with extensive parenchymal scarring,
 cardiomegaly, and moderately large right effusion with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Increased opacity in the right ___/infrahilar region
 and pleural thickening and scarring with retraction in the left upper zone as
 well as blunting of the left costophrenic angle and scarring at the left base.
 Left vascular stent noted. Prior old right-sided rib fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) COPD with extensive pleural/parenchymal scarring, right effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation, and right ___/infrahilar opacity
 are unchanged compared with ___.  
 
 2) The right-sided changes should be followed to conclusion to exclude
 underlying mass.  The left apical scarring should also be followed over time
 to exclude an underlying neoplasm.
