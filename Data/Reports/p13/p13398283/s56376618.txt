                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with confusion, weakness,  // eval for ICH, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is a similar pattern of
 linear density in the right perihilar region which may represent a focus of
 scarring.  No convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema.  No large effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contour is
 prominent which could be due to an unfolded thoracic aorta.  Imaged osseous
 structures appear intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right perihilar linear density likely represents scarring.  No acute findings.
