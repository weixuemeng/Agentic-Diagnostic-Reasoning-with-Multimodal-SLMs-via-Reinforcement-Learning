 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 are mildly hyperinflated.  The lung fields are clear. There is no
 pneumothorax, fracture or dislocation.  Limited assessment of the abdomen is
 unremarkable.  A rounded opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of two
 mid to lower  thoracic vertebral bodies is only seen on the lateral view and
 likely represents osteophytosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 
 2.  A rounded opacity overlying the mid to lower thoracic spine likely
 represents osteophytosis and less likely a discrete lung nodule projecting
 over the spine.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent repeat lateral and shallow oblique radiographs
 are recommended for further assessment of a rounded opacity seen on the
 lateral view.
