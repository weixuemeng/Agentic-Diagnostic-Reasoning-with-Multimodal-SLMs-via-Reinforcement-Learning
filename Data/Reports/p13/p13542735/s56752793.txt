                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with epigastric pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ at 2:25
 a.m. and thoracic spine radiographs from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minimal bibasilar opacities correspond
 with atelectasis seen on concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis.  No confluent
 consolidation is identified.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion or interstitial edema is evident.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal acontours are within normal limits and unchanged
 from prior.  Mild prominence of the hila bilaterally is likely secondary to
 large underlying vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis as confirmed on concurrent CT.
