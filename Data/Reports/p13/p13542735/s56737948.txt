 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 STUDY:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal contours
 appear unremarkable.  The right hilus is prominent, likely reflecting vascular
 structures, but lymphadenopathy can also be present.  The lungs demonstrate
 minimal bibasilar and lingular atelectasis as well as mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Clips in
 the right upper quadrant are compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 Enlarged right hilum.
