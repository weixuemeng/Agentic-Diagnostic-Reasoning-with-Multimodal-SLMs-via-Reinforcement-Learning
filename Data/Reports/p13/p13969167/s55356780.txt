                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fracture, preoperative evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is not engorged.  Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral
 view is compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Calcified lymph
 nodes are again seen within the hila and mediastinum compatible with prior
 granulomatous disease.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar patchy opacities likely
 reflecting atelectasis.
