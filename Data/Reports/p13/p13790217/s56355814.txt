                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Evaluate
 for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  A vague opacity is noted projecting
 over the right cardiophrenic angle, without obscuration of the right heart
 border.  There might be some streaky retrocardiac opacities, but no other
 focal opacities are seen.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis may be present as well.
