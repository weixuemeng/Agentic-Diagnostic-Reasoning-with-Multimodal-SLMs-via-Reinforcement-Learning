                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // Eval for CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of fine detail in the lower lungs and chest is considerably limited
 by overlying soft tissues. Allowing for this, there is increased density over
 the lower half of both lung bases, though this could represent artifact due to
 overlying soft tissues, the possibility of parenchymal opacity cannot be
 excluded. There is faint suggestion of bibasilar air bronchograms. There is
 upper zone redistribution.  The possibility of more extensive CHF or of small
 effusions would be difficult to exclude on this view. The base of the left
 lung is not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam, as detailed above. Cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film.
 Upper zone redistribution. The possibility of CHF, focal basilar
 consolidations, or  small effusions cannot be excluded. If there is a concern
 for focal consolidation at the lung bases, then PA and additional lateral view
 may help for further evaluation of the lung bases.
