                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF exacerbation s/p intubation  // evaluate
 intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 23:35
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina. An enteric tube
 descends below the field of view.
 
 As before, overlying soft tissues, somewhat limit examination.  Allowing for
 this, the current film suggests clearly pronounced pulmonary vascular
 engorgement and interstitial edema.  Based on the upper zones, this is
 probably increased compared with the most recent prior film. Probable left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Atelectasis at right base. No gross
 right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carina. Probable slightly
 increased pulmonary edema from 23:35 on ___.  Probable left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation and atelectasis are right base.
