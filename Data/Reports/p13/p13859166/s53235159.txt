                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoNa, hx of pulm nodule  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs appear mildly hyperinflated suggesting COPD.  The trachea is
 central.  The cardiomediastinal contour is normal.  The heart is not enlarged.
 Pleural thickening and probable calcifications of the bilateral lung apices
 likely reflects prior granulomatous disease.  Deformity of the right fourth
 rib is consistent with an old healed fracture.  No lobar consolidation,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.  Bones appear diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.
