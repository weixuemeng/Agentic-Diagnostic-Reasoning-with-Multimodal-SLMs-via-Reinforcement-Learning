                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia tachycardia and back pain in the
 setting of recent cancer l spien tenderness  // eval for PE and compression
 fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs the most recent on ___ and chest CT without contrast on on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A loculated right
 pleural effusion is unchanged in appearance from ___.  Extensive
 fibrotic right parenchymal changes and a perihilar right-sided mass are stable
 in appearance and better evaluated on CT from ___.  There is subtly
 increased right infrahilar opacity compared to the prior radiograph.  As
 before, there is mild hyperinflation of the left lung, not significantly
 changed.  There is a small rounded lucency at the apex of the right lung
 suggesting a small pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Subtly increased opacity in the right infrahilar region may be related to
 post treatment changes or a focus of infection in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
 2. Loculated right pleural effusion is stable.
 3. Small right apical pneumothorax.
