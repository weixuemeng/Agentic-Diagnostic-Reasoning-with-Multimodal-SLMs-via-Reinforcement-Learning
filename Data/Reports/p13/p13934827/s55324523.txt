                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/non small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy, recurrent
 spontaneous pneumothorax, COPD (on 4L O2 at home), and chronic PE with
 significant left side bronchopleural fistula s/p L chest tube x 2 and elective
 intubation for planned decortication now s/p cricothyroidotomy   aborted
 thoracotomy  // intubated, daily eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, widespread subcutaneous emphysema
 has progressed in reduces the sensitivity for detecting small pneumothoraces. 
 With this limitation in mind, no definite pneumothorax is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Diffuse heterogeneous pulmonary
 opacities in persist, with slight improved aeration at the left lung base.
