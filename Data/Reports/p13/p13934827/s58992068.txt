                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, tachycardia and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___. Chest CTA
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, as evidenced by flattening of the
 diaphragms a lateral view, compatible with emphysema. No pleural effusion or 
 pneumothorax.  Prominence of the right hilum is compatible with known
 malignancy and adenopathy, but would be better assessed by CT.  Increased
 opacity in the mid-right lung may represent progression of disease, however,
 superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.  The previously seen
 middle lobe infarction has resolved.  Heart is normal size.  Cervical hardware
 is incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Opacity in the mid-right lung may represent progression of disease,
 however, superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude.
 2. Known lung cancer would be better assessed by CT.
