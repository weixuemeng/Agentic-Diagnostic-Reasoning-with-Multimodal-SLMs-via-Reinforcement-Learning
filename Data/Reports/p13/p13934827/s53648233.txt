                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with talc pleurodesis  // interval changes     
 interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 18 25 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of second right basilar chest tube with appearance of
 subcutaneous emphysema involving the right lateral chest wall.  There is still
 likely a small right pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Stable opacity in the
 right perihilar and upper lung which may reflect radiation fibrosis when
 correlated with recent CT dated ___, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 large effusions.  Spinal hardware overlying the mid to lower cervical spine.
