                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left chest bronchopleural fistula and new
 Left IJ central line  // s/p central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter whose tip extends to the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects 2 cm from the carina.  Left apical and left basal
 chest tubes are present.
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again noted, which limits evaluation of
 the underlying lung parenchyma.  A persisting left pneumothorax is suspected. 
 There has been slight increase in opacification of the right lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited evaluation of the lung parenchyma secondary to extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema.  A persisting left pneumothorax is nonetheless suspected.
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm from the carina.
