                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi supine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low and there is again mild relative elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, somewhat increased.  The right costophrenic angle is difficult
 to assess and a small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  Increased
 opacity is present at the left lung base although probably compatible with
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left basilar opacity, probably attributed to that volume loss and
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not entirely excluded, however.  If potential
 infection remains a clinical concern, short-term follow-up radiographs may be
 helpful.
