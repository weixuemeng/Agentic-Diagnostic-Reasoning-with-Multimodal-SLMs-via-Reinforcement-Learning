 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia after thrombectomy  // new hypoxia
 --> new focal opacities? pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right
 internal jugular vein catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the
 cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low. Signs of mild fluid overload are
 present.  No larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.
 Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.
