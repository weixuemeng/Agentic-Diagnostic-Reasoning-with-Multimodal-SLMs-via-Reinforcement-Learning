                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 CHEST X-RAY ON ___
 
 ADDENDUM:  Subsequent to the initial interpretation, the patient has provided
 prior chest imaging including a chest radiograph on ___ and chest
 CT scans from ___, ___ and ___.  All of these studies show the same
 comma-shaped lesion in the right lung close to the minor fissure and the
 anterior chest wall.  Its stability over more than ___ years indicates this
 is a benign lesion of no active concern.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a history of pleuritic chest tightness for
 two months and night sweats.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging:
 
 A ___-mm wide elliptical nodule in the right upper lobe projects over the third
 anterior interspace.  It could also be a small mucoid impaction.  Any prior
 chest radiograph should be obtained to see if this is a new finding warranting
 further investigation.  It is an incidental finding, unrelated to the
 patient's clinical complaints.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are all normal.
 
 If prior radiographs cannot be obtained I would supplement this study with
 shallow oblique views to get a better view of this lesion, and then determine
 appropriate followup.
