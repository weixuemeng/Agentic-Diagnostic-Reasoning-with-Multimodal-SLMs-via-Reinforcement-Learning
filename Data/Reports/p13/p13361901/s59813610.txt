                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As on recent CT there is severe scoliosis which somewhat limits evaluation of
 the mediastinal structures.  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  There are
 no focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is coronary artery calcification and stenting.  The thoracic aorta is
 tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
