                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen.  There is relative opacity projecting over
 the right upper hemithorax/upper lung at the level of the mid right clavicle,
 which may be due to overlapping structures and/or underlying scarring. 
 However, AP lordotic view of the chest would be helpful for further
 evaluation.  There is mild bi-apical pleural thickening.  Suggestion of
 pleural line along the left lung apex is seen and a tiny left apical
 pneumothorax is difficult to exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax projecting
 over the right lung apex and the mid right clavicle could be due to
 overlapping structures and scarring; however, AP lordotic view would be
 helpful for further evaluation.
 
 Difficult to exclude tiny left apical pneumothorax if site of chest pain. 
 This could also be further evaluated on AP lordotic view and/or inspiratory
 and expiratory views of the chest.
