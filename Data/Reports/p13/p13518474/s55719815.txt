                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Abdominal radiograph ___, CT abdomen ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There is mild subsegmental atelectasis at
 the lung bases. The aorta is slightly tortuous. The hilar contours are normal
 allowing for lung volumes. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Degenerative
 changes seen in the right shoulder girdle. Scattered calcifications in the
 subcutaneous tissues may be vascular.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
