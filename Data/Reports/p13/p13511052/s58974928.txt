 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath  // shortness of
 breath with exertion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Compared to ___, more prominent bulge in
 the right supracardiac mediastinal contour is due to a more dilated or
 tortuous and partially calcified ascending thoracic aorta.  Heart is normal
 size and I do not see aortic valvular calcification which is sometimes visible
 on conventional radiographs. Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature is normal.
