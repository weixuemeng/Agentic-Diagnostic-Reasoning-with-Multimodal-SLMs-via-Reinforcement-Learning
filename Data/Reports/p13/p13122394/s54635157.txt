                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness, lightedness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged with rightward shift indicative of
 right-sided volume loss, a finding which is chronic.  Hilar contours are
 unchanged and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Focal spiculated
 opacity in the right upper lobe was better assessed on previous chest CT. 
 Previously noted ill-defined opacity surrounding this nodule seen on prior
 chest radiograph has resolved.  Additionally, known spiculated nodule in the
 left lower lobe is better assessed on the prior CT and not well seen on the
 current radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of spiculated nodular opacity in the right upper lobe, as
 seen on prior CT.  Additional left lower lobe nodule seen on prior CT is not
 well assessed on the current radiograph.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 otherwise demonstrated.
