                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dizziness, L hand and leg weakness. h/o stroke in past
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Speckled calcific
 densities projecting over the upper lungs reflect the presence of numerous
 calcified granuloma seen on prior exam.  There is also calcified pleural
 plaque seen on prior CT which likely accounts for subtle increased density
 projecting over the right lung apex.  The remainder of both lungs appear
 clear.  There is a ovoid density abutting the right heart border which
 reflects costochondral calcification.  The heart is top-normal in size.  The
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable aside from a mildly unfolded thoracic
 aorta.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
