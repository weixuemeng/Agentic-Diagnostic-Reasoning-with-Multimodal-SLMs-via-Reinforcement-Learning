                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged.  Lung volumes are low.  Aorta
 remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  There is crowding
 of bronchovascular structures as result of low lung volumes, without definite
 evidence for overt pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted,
 more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, findings which could reflect
 atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
 examination.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified allowing
 for this.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced within
 retrocardiac region, may reflect atelectasis however aspiration or infection
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
