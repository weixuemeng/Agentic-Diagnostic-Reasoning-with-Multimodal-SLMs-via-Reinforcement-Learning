 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung ca s/p Ommaya placement

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC projects over the left subclavian vein, just beyond the axillary
 vein junction.  Although positioning limits comparison, it appears slightly
 more lateral than on previous examination.  No pneumothorax.  Slight interval
 worsening of right upper lobe post obstructive consolidation with bowing of
 the fissure.  Heterogeneous consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes
 are also more prominent than on prior examination.  Right mediastinal and
 hilar lymphadenopathy have been more fully evaluated on recent chest CT.  A
 moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.  The left lung is clear except
 for minimal linear left basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left PICC projects over the left subclavian vein appearing slightly more
 proximal in position than on previous examination although positioning
 differences limits comparison.
 2. Slight worsening of extensive right upper lobe consolidation.
