                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with recently diagnosed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma
 metastatic to liver and brain s/p Ommaya reservoir placement ___ who presents
 with worsening hypoxia  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A dense right upper lobe airspace consolidation persists.  In comparison to
 the most recent study on ___, lucencies within this consolidation
 are more visible, suggesting likely a component of resolving lobar collapse or
 infection.  Rightward mediastinal shift is less pronounced.  Right pleural
 effusion has slightly decreased.  Left lung is essentially clear, without
 consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Right heart border is silhouetted. 
 Aortic arch calcifications.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New lucencies within the right upper lobe consolidation, suggesting a
 component of resolving atelectasis or infection.
 2. Right pleural effusion, likely improved.
