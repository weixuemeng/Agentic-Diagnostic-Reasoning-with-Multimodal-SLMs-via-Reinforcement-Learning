 INDICATION:   ___F with syncope  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is improved aeration in the right upper lobe with persistent dense
 consolidation.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged noting significant patient rotation.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the aortic arch.  Known mediastinal and hilar adenopathy not clearly
 delineated by this portable film.  Mid thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted. 
 Right chest wall port is new.  The catheter tip is not clearly delineated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in the degree of consolidation in the right upper lung
 with residual opacity, some of which is due to underlying mass with additional
 components of postobstructive atelectasis and/or infection possible.
