                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with asthma s/p intubation during EGD.  //
 Please eval for ET tube placement and pulmonary process.
 ___ year old woman with asthma s/p bronch and ET tube reposition.  // Please
 eval for RUL change and ET tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The initial radiograph from ___ shows interval placement of an
 endotracheal tube whose tip terminates above the clavicles. Advancement by 1-2
 cm would provide more effective ventilation.  There is also new right upper
 lobe atelectasis with associated volume loss. The left lung is clear.  The
 heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. A nasogastric tube
 coils in the stomach, distal tip not visualized.
 
 The follow-up radiograph from ___ shows slight advancement of the
 endotracheal tube. The right upper lobe has re-expanded, but lung volumes
 remain low. There are new bilateral airspace opacities which are most likely
 due to pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new. 
 Increased retrocardiac opacification is most likely due to atelectasis. Heart
 size has increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe atelectasis has resolved, but there is new pulmonary edema
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.
