                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, chills, headache, and seizure.  History of HIV.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Each hilum appears mildly enlarged. 
 This appearance may be due to lymphadenopathy or enlarged pulmonary arteries,
 although lack of enlargement of pulmonary arteries on the lateral view makes
 some degree of lymphadenopathy perhaps more likely.  There are also patchy
 lower lung opacities bilaterally, probably in the right lower lobe and
 lingula.  Posterior lower lung opacification is better visualized on the
 lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
  
 1.  Bilateral hilar enlargement, suspected to reflect lymphadenopathy,
 although not entirely specific, since other etiologies such as enlarged
 pulmonary arteries may explain enlarged hila.
 
 2.  Lower lung opacities, worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
