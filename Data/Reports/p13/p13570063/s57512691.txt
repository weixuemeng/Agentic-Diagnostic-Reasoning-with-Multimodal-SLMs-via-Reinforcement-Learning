                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Subsequent CTA of the chest from ___ at 6:21 am
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusions.  The heart size is normal.  The apparent enlargement of the aortic
 contour corresponds with tortuosity and unfolding of the aortic arch, seen on
 follow-up chest CT.  The remaining mediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs without consolidation or effusion.
 2.  Widened contour of the thoracic aorta corresponds to tortuosity and
 unfolding of the aortic arch, better characterized on follow-up chest CT.
