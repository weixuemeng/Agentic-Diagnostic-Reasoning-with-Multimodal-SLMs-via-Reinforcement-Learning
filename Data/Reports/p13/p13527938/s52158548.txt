                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough x2 weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are well inflated bilaterally with subtle opacity adjacent
 the right heart border on frontal view and projecting over the lower thoracic
 vertebra on the lateral view.  These findings may represent a possible
 developing pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Pleural
 surfaces are unremarkable.  The aorta is stably tortuous.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and within normal limits.  There are
 stable multilevel degenerative changes seen along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle lower lung and posterior opacities may represent an early
 developing pneumonia.
