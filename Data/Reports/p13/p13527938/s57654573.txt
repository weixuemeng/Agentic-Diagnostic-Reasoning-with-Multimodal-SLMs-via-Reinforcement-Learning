                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female who complains of palpitations and dizziness. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam from
 ___.  A subtle hazy opacity at the left lung base on the frontal
 not well seen on the lateral view.  Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear
 noting stable right apical scarring.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left lung base on the frontal view,
 potentially due to atelectasis; however, developing infiltrate is not
 excluded.
