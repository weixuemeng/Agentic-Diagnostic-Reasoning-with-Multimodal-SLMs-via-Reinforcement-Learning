                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post diverting loop ileostomy, still intubated after
 procedure.  Lines and tubes assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph:  ___.  CT torso:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ET tube terminates 6 cm from the carina.  Lung volumes remain low.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is somewhat worse.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is less defined, hazy,
 and engorged suggesting mild pulmonary congestion.  However, there is no frank
 pulmonary edema.  A small left pleural effusion likely persists.  There is no
 apical pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube terminates 6 cm from the carina.
 
 2. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is worse.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary congestion is new.
