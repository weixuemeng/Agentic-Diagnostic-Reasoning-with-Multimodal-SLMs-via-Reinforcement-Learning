                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for effusion,
 pneumonia, or edema.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 Lung volumes are low.  A thin curvilinear radiodense line projects over the
 right apex, and mediastinum and appears to form a loop in the region of the
 right atrium.  This may represent an external pacer.  The cardiac size is
 minimally enlarged.  The azygos vein is prominent and there is congestion of
 the vascular pedicle.  The pulmonary vessels are enlarged and ill-defined
 suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary edema left greater than right. 
 Platelike atelectasis is noted at the left lower lobe.  There is no apical
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimally enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema left greater than right. 
 
 2.  Left lower lobe platelike atelectasis.
