                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Testicular cancer, pre-auto bone marrow transplant.  Assess for
 cardiopulmonary dysfunction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a 3.8 x 2.5 cm
 rounded density projecting over the right lower lung which may correlate with
 1.9cm lesion on CT torso performed ___. In setting of known germ
 cell tumor, rapidly growing metastatic deposit is of concern.  No other
 definite pulmonary nodule is evident.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No osseous
 abnormality is identified.  Retrosternal space appears clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  3.8-cm rounded density projecting over the right lower lung may
 correlate with 1.9cm lesion on recent CT. Concern for aggressive metastatic
 disease. Recommend re-assessment with chest CT and possible biopsy evaluation.
 
 ___ placed these findings on the critical communications dashboard at 5pm
 on ___.
