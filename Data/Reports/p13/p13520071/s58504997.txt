                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung metastases postop day 1 status post VATS wedge resection. 
 Chest tube was pulled.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged with
 redemonstration of mild central pulmonary vasculature engorgement.  Again
 appreciated is a roughly 2 cm nodular opacity at the right lung base
 corresponding to a similarly consolidative focus on recent CT examination is
 suggestive of infectious process.  A small left effusion is unchanged.  The
 left-sided chest tube has been removed without residual pneumothorax. 
 Subcutaneous gas in the lateral chest wall soft tissue is improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Removal of left chest tube without residual pneumothorax.  Residual tiny left
 pleural effusion and similar appearance of the right lung base nodular density
 previously characterized as possible pneumonia on CT.
