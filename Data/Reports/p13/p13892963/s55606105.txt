                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with relative hypoxia, intubated  // acute
 cardiopulm disease, ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior outside radiograph the chest obtained
 at 07:06 today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior outside study, there has been interval collapse of the right
 upper lobe, with elevation of the horizontal fissure. The aerated portions of
 the lungs are grossly clear. There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.8 cm above the
 level of the carina, and could be advanced slightly. A nasogastric tube
 courses through the esophagus, with distal tip in the stomach, but side hole
 port at the level of the distal esophagus, an can be advanced approximately
 6.5 cm to ensure placement into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Right upper lobe collapse, as described above. This could potentially be
 due to aspiration in the setting of known seizure.
 2. Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube positions as discussed above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:26 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.
