                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New hypoxemia in a patient with metastatic sarcoma.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum appear grossly unchanged.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip
 is at the cavoatrial junction.  Lungs are essentially clear except for minimal
 increase in right basal opacity that potentially might reflect interval
 development of infectious process, although atelectasis would be another
 possibility.  No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 present.
