                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man on chemo with worsening abdominal pain and
 hypotension.  Evaluation for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well-expanded,
 although nodular opacity is seen projecting over the anterior aspect of the
 left fourth rib.  There is no pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nodular opacity in the left lung could represent metastatic
 disease given the clinical history of cancer, and a dedicated chest CT is
 recommended for further characterization.  No pneumonia is seen.
