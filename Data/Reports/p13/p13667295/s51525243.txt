                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and pain with inspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is patchy
 scarring at each lung apex but no evidence for pneumothorax.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  The lateral view depicts a geographic peripheral opacity
 which correlates with poor delineation of the cardiac border along the medial
 left lung base.  However, some of this appearance may correspond to a patchy
 opacity in the left lower lung seen more laterally that suggests a developing
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggest pneumonia in the left lower lung, although it is
 not clear that the entirety of peripheral geographic opacity seen on the
 lateral view obscuring the anterior left hemidiaphragm entirely reflects
 pneumonia as opposed to an epicardial fat pad.  Management alternatives
 include a short-term followup after treatment or consideration of chest CT to
 delineate the findings further if needed clinically.
