                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 are low lung volumes, making evaluation suboptimal.  There are perihilar
 opacities, left greater than right, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, although infectious process is not excluded.  Given that the left
 costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image, no large pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, making evaluation suboptimal.  Left greater
 than right perihilar alveolar opacities could relate to asymmetric edema
 versus infection.
