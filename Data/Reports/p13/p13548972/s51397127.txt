                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with likely aspiration pneumonia  // assess for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There
 is a new relatively massive platelike atelectasis at the right lung bases,
 combined to an area of ill-defined subtle parenchymal opacity. Overall, the
 findings are consistent with aspiration.  The appearance of the left lung is
 unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.
