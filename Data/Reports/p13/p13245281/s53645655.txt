                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 01:54 from outside hospital
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as result of the low lung
 volumes appearing mildly to moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 with possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of increasing atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with worsening bibasilar atelectasis and possible mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
