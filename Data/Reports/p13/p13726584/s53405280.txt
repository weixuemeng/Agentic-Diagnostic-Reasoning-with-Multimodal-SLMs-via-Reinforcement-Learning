                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Sarcoid and cough.
 
 Question recurrence of sarcoid.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Assessment of the mediastinum demonstrates no definitive evidence of
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy and substantially less pronounced right
 paratracheal lymph node as compared to prior examination.  On the other hand,
 there are currently bilateral basal opacities, primarily involving the right
 middle lobe and lingula consisting of ground-glass and potentially nodular
 components, they are more pronounced than back on ___.  Although
 those findings might reflect recurrence of sarcoidosis, infectious process is
 another possibility.  Correlation with clinical findings and laboratory
 findings is recommended.  If clinically warranted, chest CT would be
 beneficial next step for precise characterization of the abnormalities.
