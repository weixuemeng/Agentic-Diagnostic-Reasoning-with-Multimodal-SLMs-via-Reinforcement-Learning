                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sarcoid, tapered off prednisone  // f/u
 sarcoid      f/u sarcoid
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change.  Again
 there is evidence of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  On the lateral
 view, there is increased opacification anterior to the major fissure.  This
 probably correlates with slight increase in opacification below the minor
 fissure on the frontal view, consistent with volume loss or possible
 consolidation in the middle lobe.  The opacification it the left base is
 unchanged.
