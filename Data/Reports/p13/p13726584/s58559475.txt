                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic cough, evaluate for
 bronchiectasis or structural lung abnormalities.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No
 typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta is unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  A hazy density occupies the right
 lung base is identified on the lateral view as an infiltrate in the posterior
 portion of the right middle lobe abutting the minor fissure as well as the
 large fissure.  There exist also some hazy densities on the left base,
 superimposed on the lateral heart border and suspicious for similar
 infiltrates in the left upper lobe lingula as well.
 
 There is a prominence in the right upper mediastinum, specifically occupying
 the right tracheal bronchial angulation which is up to 2 cm wide.  This could
 be an enlarged lymph node related to the pneumonic infiltrates seen on the
 present examination.  Differential diagnostic possibilities exist such as
 hilar mass and thus should be followed up.
 
 Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pneumonic infiltrates in right middle lobe and left upper lobe
 lingula.  Coinciding prominence of superior mediastinal node.  Followup
 examination in two weeks is recommended.  Correlate with patient's clinical
 symptoms and signs.
