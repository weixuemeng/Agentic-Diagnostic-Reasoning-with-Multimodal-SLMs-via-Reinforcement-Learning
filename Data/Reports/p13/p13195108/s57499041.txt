 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 18:23
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy, evaluate for lung expansion.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left subclavian central line is unchanged in position with its tip in the
 mid SVC.  A right chest tube remains in place and there continues to be
 loculated right apical pneumothorax with some adjacent chain sutures and
 surgical clips in the right suprahilar region, suggestive of a prior right
 upper lobectomy.  Subcutaneous emphysema is also visualized within the lateral
 chest and neck soft tissues.  The remaining right visualized lung and left
 lung are grossly clear.  There is some elevation and tenting the right
 hemidiaphragm, likely related to the volume loss from the surgery.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
