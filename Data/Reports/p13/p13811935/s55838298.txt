                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with known hiatal hernia, presently with
 diverticulitis and hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia, effusion versus
 compression.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  Available for comparison are previous chest examination from
 ___.  There exists a very large hiatal hernia occupying the
 entire left lung base, but also reaching in to the mid portion of the lower
 right hemithorax.  This very large hiatal hernia existed already on the
 previous examination in ___.  Gas-distended large and small bowel loops are
 seen in this area.  The heart is slightly obscured by these structures but
 significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely and there is no pulmonary
 congestive pattern.  Markedly elevated left-sided diaphragm reaches the level
 of the hiatus and a plate atelectasis is noted, but no acute parenchymal
 infiltrate is seen.  On the right lung base only minor peripheral thin plate
 atelectasis are identified and no evidence of pleural effusion is seen in the
 lateral or the posterior pleural sinuses.  Review is also performed of the
 most recent abdominal CT examination of ___, which covers the lower
 thoracic area and confirms the findings here described.  Plus there exists a
 plate atelectasis in the left lung base but no acute new parenchymal
 infiltrates are seen and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
