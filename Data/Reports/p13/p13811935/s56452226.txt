                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with recent repair of large hiatal hernia. 
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Since the prior
 study, the size of the hernia sac has significantly decreased.  The bilateral
 lungs are better expanded with some evidence of mild atelectasis of the left
 lung adjacent to the hernia sac.  There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, or pneumothorax.  There is no significant pleural effusion.  The heart
 size is normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Marked interval improvement in size of hernia sac as well as
 improvement in bilateral lung aeration with minimal atelectasis in the left
 lung.  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
