                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lethargy and weakness since yesterday.  Also with altered mental
 status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There

 cannot be excluded, similar in appearance compared to the prior radiograph
 from ___.  There is minimal right lower lung atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have decreased.  There
 is fluid tracking within the major fissure on the left.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, decreased
 compared to the prior study from ___.
 
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacification, possibly atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be excluded.
