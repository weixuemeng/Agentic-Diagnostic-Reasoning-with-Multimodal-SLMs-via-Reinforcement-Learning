                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right
 basilar opacity is likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis as seen on the concurrent CT abdomen.  A rounded opacity in the
 right mid lung is likely loculated fluid in the right major fissure, given the
 partially loculated pleural effusion.  The right upper lung zone and the left
 lung are clear aside from mild left basilar atelectasis.  Heart size is top
 normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Hilar contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Partially loculated right pleural effusion.  A right mid lung
 opacity is likely fluid in the major fissure.  Followup CXR is recommended to
 ensure resolution.
