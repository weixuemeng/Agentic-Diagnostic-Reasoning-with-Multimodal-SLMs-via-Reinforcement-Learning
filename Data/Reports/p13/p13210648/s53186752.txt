                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size with left ventricular configuration, and
 the aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Partially loculated
 right pleural effusion has decreased in size, with small residual loculated
 component remaining laterally, which has decreased in width from approximately
 1.8 cm to 0.8 cm.  An incompletely marginated elliptical 2 cm diameter opacity
 located central to this region is unchanged in size measuring about 3 cm. 
 Minimal linear atelectasis is present at both lung bases.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased partially loculated right pleural effusion with small
 residual loculated component laterally and probable 3 cm intrafissural
 collection.  Followup radiograph in ___ weeks may be helpful to document
 resolution and to exclude a solid pleural lesion.
