                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for infection.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Slight coarsened
 appearance of the interstitial markings suggests underlying chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. 
 There is likely bibasal atelectasis which could be compressive due to the
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.  There
 is a significant chronic displaced sternal fracture, which is in overall
 unchanged configuration compared with a CT of the chest dated ___. 
 Multiple compression deformities are also again noted within the thoracic
 spine, appearing stable from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial lung disease with small bilateral effusions and
 bibasal compressive atelectasis.  Stable bony deformities.
