                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 lungs appear clear.  There is probably a very small pleural effusion along the
 left, noting new blunting of the left frontal sulcus on the PA view.  There is
 exaggerated kyphosis associated with a moderate anterior wedge compression
 deformity along the mid thoracic vertebral body, not significantly changed. 
 The bones also appear demineralized, with multilevel compression deformities
 along the mid-to-lower thoracic spine, again not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspected trace left-sided pleural effusion; otherwise no
 significant change.
