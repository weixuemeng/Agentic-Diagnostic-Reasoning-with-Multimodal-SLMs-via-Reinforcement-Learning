 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:37 PM
  Low lung volumes with central pulmonary vascular congestion and trace edema.
  There is some increased density as compared to the prior study seen at the
  posterior base on lateral view only and wall this may represent atelectasis,
  infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Status post mechanical fall with right-sided rib fractures,
 pulmonary contusions and desaturations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is re- demonstration of moderate cardiomegaly with tortuous aortic arch.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the arch.  There is mild
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and trace edema.  There is some
 increased density at the posterior base seen on lateral view only.  There is
 no effusion or pneumothorax.  The rib fractures identified on prior chest CT
 are not well evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild facet congestion and trace edema.
 2. Some increased density compared to the prior at the posterior base on
 lateral view only which may represent atelectasis. Infection cannot be
 excluded.
