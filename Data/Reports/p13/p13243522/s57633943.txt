                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of CF, now with concern for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest.  Right port terminates in the
 right atrium.  Diffuse bronchiectasis is seen, consistent with known CF. 
 Opacity in the right upper lobe is unchanged from prior exam and likely
 reflects chronic right upper lobe collapse.  Opacity in the left lower lobe is
 similar to prior exam and consistent with bronchiectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Opacity in the right upper lobe is unchanged from prior exam and likely
 reflects chronic right upper lobe collapse.  Given that this is longstanding,
 evaluation of the right upper lobe bronchus such as with bronchoscopy is
 recommended.
 
 2.  Opacity in the left lower lobe is similar to prior exam and consistent
 with bronchiectasis.
