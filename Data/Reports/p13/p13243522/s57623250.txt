 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:44 PM
  Right Port-A-Cath ends in the mid right atrium, unchanged.  Extensive
  bilateral bronchiectasis, as seen on the prior radiograph from ___.  Heterogeneous opacity in the upper aspect of the right lung has
  decreased, particularly when compared to the study from ___,
  likely improving atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cystic fibrosis, now with nonfunctioning right chest port.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___, as well as CTA chest from ___ and
 CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right port with the tip in
 the right atrium, as before, without obvious kink or obstruction.  Chronic
 collapse of the right upper lobe and severe multifocal bronchiectasis and
 scarring is redemonstrated, but generally improved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right port with the tip in the right atrium, as before, without obvious
 kink or obstruction.  
 
 2. Redemonstration of chronic collapse of the right upper lobe and severe
 multifocal bronchiectasis/scarring, generally improved.
