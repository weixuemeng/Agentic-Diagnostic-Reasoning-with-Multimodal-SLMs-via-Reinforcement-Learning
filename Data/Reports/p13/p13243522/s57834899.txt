                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, complaining of worsening
 cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lungs are chronically extremely abnormal, but there is relatively little
 change since ___.  The chronic collapse around severe bronchiectasis
 in the right upper lobe is the most prominent feature.  Bronchiectasis and
 peribronchial infiltration obscuring the left heart border is minimally worse
 today than before, but within the range that could be artifactual rather than
 real.  Lungs elsewhere show the same degree of hyperinflation, bronchiectasis
 and scarring.  The heart is top normal size.
 
 Of note, despite the lack of radiographic correspondence with clinical
 findings, I think it is still reasonable to evaluate the patient's changing
 circumstances with conventional radiographs first, before repeating chest CT
 scans.
