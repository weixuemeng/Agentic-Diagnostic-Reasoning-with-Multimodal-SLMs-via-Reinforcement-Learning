                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia, pulmonary edema.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, ___ and prior
 chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been
 interval removal of a right-sided IJ central venous catheter.  There is
 redemonstration of chronic changes of distortion and opacification of both
 lungs. Increased opacity in the right upper lobe is stable and likely relates
 to chronically collapsed right upper lobe and bronchiectasis as seen on prior
 chest CT.  Opacities along the left mid lung field have slightly improved. 
 There is no new focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Chronic changes of distortion and opacification of both lungs.  No
 new focal consolidation.
