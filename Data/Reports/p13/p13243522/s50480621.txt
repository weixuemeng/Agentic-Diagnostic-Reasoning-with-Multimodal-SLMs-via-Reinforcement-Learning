                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Diffuse severe bronchiectasis, most pronounced within
 the upper lobes, with architectural distortion is compatible with the
 patient's known history of cystic fibrosis.  There is persistent collapse and
 consolidation of the right upper lobe and lingula, findings which appear
 relatively unchanged compared to the previous exams.  Slight rightward shift
 of the trachea likely reflects volume loss in the right lung.  No pulmonary
 vascular congestion is demonstrated.  Patchy opacities within the right lung
 base and left mid lung field appear slightly worse in the interval.  There is
 a possible small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Remote right-sided rib fracture is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive bronchiectasis with chronic right upper lobe and lingular collapse
 and consolidation.  Patchy opacities in the left mid and right lung base
 appear progressed in the interval, which is concerning for worsening airways
 infection or inflammation.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
