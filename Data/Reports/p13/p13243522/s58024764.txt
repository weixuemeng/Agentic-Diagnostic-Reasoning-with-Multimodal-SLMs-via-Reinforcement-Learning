                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cf, hx of chf.  // eval for pna, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Chronic consolidation in the right upper lobe with bronchiectasis and left
 upper lobe bronchiectasis is again seen.  Consolidation in the lingula appears
 similar to prior.  Right middle lobe and bibasilar bronchiectasis are better
 seen in prior CT's. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.  Loss of volume in the
 upper lobes is again seen.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  There are
 multiple healed right rib fractures.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.  Right chest port tip is not seen, can be followed to
 the lower SVC then, obscured by the pacer leads.  Left chest cardiac device is
 in normal position.  Right lower lobe opacities have improved
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pulmonary edema.  Multifocal consolidations are most likely chronic.  If
 there is persistent concern for acute process, CT chest would be the next
 imaging study.
