                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cystic fibrosis and history of recurrent
 pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the PICC.  The heart size is
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The
 lungs demonstrate severe bronchiectatic changes with consolidation of the
 right upper lobe and lingula, progressed since prior study.  Multiple areas of
 pulmonary opacification are present with a heterogeneous distribution.  There
 is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bronchiectasis with consolidation of the right upper lobe and lingula.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with findings suggestive of pulmonary edema in the
 appropriate setting although multifocal superimposed pneumonia is not excluded
 as a potential etiology by this study.
