                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p icd implant vis subclavian // r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Chronic collapse of the right upper
 lobe and severe multi focal bronchiectasis and scarring is stable. Opacity in
 the left upper lobe represents engorged vessels and worsening of bronchial
 impaction. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Small left-sided pleural
 effusion is new.  No pneumothorax. The ICD is in the appropriate position with
 leads seen in the right atrium and right ventricle. The right-sided
 Port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax.
