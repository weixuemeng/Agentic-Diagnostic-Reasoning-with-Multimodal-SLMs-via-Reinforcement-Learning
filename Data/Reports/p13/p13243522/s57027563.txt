                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chronic fibrosis and history of
 systolic congestive heart failure.  Admitted with exacerbation of both,
 improving symptoms, evaluate for degree of improvement in pulmonary edema or
 focal consolidations.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position, and analysis is made in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged.  The
 widespread chronic pulmonary changes including fibrosis, bronchiectasis and
 overlying infiltrates have not changed significantly during the latest four
 days examination interval.  Comparison is therefore extended to the PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  It can be stated that some
 regress of hazy infiltrates in the right upper lobe area has occurred and also
 some scattered infiltrates in the right lower lobe area appear to have
 diminished.  Left-sided changes again appear rather stable.  Pulmonary
 congestive vascular pattern is difficult to assess in the presence of chronic
 interstitial disease and ectasia or it can be stated that no pleural effusion
 was present on examination of ___.  Comparison with chest
 examination of ___, demonstrates the chronic pulmonary changes but
 markedly less extension of superimposed patchy parenchymal infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged heart size but stable.  Advanced chronic interstitial
 pulmonary changes including airway distortions of ectatic-type, superimposed
 lateral parenchymal infiltrates that have not changed significantly during the
 latest examination interval.  There is no radiographic evidence for acute
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion was seen, and no pneumothorax is
 present.  Comparison chest examination of ___, indicates that the
 patient has undergone a long-lasting episode of superimposed infectious
 processes.
