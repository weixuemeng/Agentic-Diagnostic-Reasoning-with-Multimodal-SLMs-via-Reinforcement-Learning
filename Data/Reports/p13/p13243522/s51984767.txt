                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cystic fibrosis and atrial tachycardia, now
 with fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  There is interval improved
 aeration of both lungs with persistent opacification of the right upper lung
 zone and bilateral hilar prominence.  Extensive abnormal background
 interstitial lung markings are stable over multiple prior studies.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right central venous catheter projects
 over the cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  There is exaggerated thoracic kyphosis.  A tapered appearance of the
 left distal clavicle is redemonstrated. Healed right posterior rib fractures
 are again seen, likely sequela of prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved ventilation with persistent right upper lobe
 opacification and chronic interstitial changes.
