                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in
 unchanged positions.  Heart size remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Bilateral hilar enlargement compatible with
 underlying lymphadenopathy is re- demonstrated as well as superior retraction
 of the hila due to chronic collapse, extensive bronchiectasis and scarring in
 the upper lobes, more so on the right.  Continued ill-defined patchy opacities
 with nodularity are seen throughout both lungs, most pronounced in the left
 lung base.  No new focal consolidation is present.  Deformity of the right rib
 cage is chronic.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic changes compatible with known history of cystic fibrosis with
 extensive upper lobe predominant bronchiectasis and multifocal areas of
 parenchymal opacification, most pronounced in the right upper lobe and left
 lower lobe.
