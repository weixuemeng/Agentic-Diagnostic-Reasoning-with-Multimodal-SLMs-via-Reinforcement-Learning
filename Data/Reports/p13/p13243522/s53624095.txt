 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the relatively extensive

 The perihilar opacity on the right is also unchanged.  Slightly improved are
 pre-existing opacities in the periphery of the right lung.  The moderate
 cardiomegaly persists, with signs of mild fluid overload but without evidence
 of pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
