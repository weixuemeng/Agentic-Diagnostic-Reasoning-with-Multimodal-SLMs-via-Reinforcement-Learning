                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cystic fibrosis here with productive sputum,
 increased shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided the AICD/ pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Right Port-A-Cath tip terminates
 in the lower SVC, unchanged. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
 again noted with left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal contour is
 unchanged with mild rightward deviation of the trachea again noted. Extensive,
 chronic parenchymal opacities with architectural distortion and bronchiectasis
 are noted bilaterally, most pronounced in the right upper and left lower lung
 fields, not substantially changed in the interval, with slight increased
 atelectasis in the right upper lobe. Remote right-sided rib fractures are
 again noted. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is clearly evident. Mild
 degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic diffuse parenchymal abnormality predominantly characterized by marked
 bronchiectasis and scarring, most pronounced in the right upper lobe and left
 lung base, compatible with cystic fibrosis, and not substantially changed in
 the interval. No new areas of parenchymal opacification clearly identified.
