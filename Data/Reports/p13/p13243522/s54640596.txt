                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, here for clean out.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, areas of
 distortion and opacification in both lungs are essentially unchanged.
 Chronically collapsed right upper lobe remains stable.  Again seen is an area
 of opacification in the lingula which likely has some component of
 consolidation and atelectasis. Lower lobes are relatively clear. A right
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
