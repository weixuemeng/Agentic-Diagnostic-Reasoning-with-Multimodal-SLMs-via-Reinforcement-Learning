                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  An
 opacity in the lingula has largely resolved.  There is also been improvement
 in some right mid lung opacities, but there is new right middle lobe
 opacification. Each hilum shows increased congestive changes.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild pulmonary edema.  Although pre-existing opacities have
 improved somewhat, particularly in the lingula, new right middle lobe
 opacification is concerning for pneumonia.
