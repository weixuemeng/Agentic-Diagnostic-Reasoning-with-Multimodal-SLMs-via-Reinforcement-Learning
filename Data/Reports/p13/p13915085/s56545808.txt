 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Permanent pacemaker is in standard position with leads in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  The heart is mildly enlarged, but there is no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Nonspecific area of increased opacity overlies
 the lower thoracic spine on the lateral view, and could potentially represent
 an early focus of pneumonia.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible early basilar pneumonia, visualized only on the lateral
 radiograph.
