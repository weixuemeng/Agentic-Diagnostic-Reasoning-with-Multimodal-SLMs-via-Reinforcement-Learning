                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  There is some coarseness of interstitial markings at the bases,
 raising the possibility of some chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no acute
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
