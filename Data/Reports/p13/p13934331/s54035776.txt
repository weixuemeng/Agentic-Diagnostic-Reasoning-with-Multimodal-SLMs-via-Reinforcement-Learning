                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Lungs remain hyperexpanded with attenuation
 of the upper lobe vessels, consistent with a severe emphysema, accompanied by
 bilateral apical scarring and upper lobe volume loss.  New subtle areas of
 opacity developed in the right upper, left mid and both lower lung regions,
 and are concerning for developing multifocal pneumonia, particularly
 considering the presence of new lung parenchymal opacities in the right middle
 lobe on recent abdominal CT of ___.  Small left pleural effusion is
 also noted and was present on the CT as well.  Followup radiograph may be
 helpful.
