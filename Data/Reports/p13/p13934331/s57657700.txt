                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Worsening ascites, abdominal pain, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP
 diameter consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Relative
 lucency of the upper lobes is consistent with pulmonary emphysema.  There is
 left greater than right biapical pleural thickening, similar as compared to
 ___.  As also seen on the prior study, there is relative prominence of
 the left apical pleural thickening which is likely stable; CT is more
 sensitive for underlying pulmonary lesions.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
