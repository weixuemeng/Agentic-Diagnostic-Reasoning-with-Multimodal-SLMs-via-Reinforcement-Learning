                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits
 and without change.  Mild paramediastinal bilateral upper lobe scarring is
 present without change from prior studies.  Lung volumes are lower compared to
 the prior study with some associated crowding of bronchovascular structures in
 the lower lungs.  Hyperlucency of upper lungs is consistent with known
 emphysema.  No definite areas of consolidation are identified to suggest
 pneumonia, but repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be
 helpful to more fully assess the lung bases if warranted clinically.
