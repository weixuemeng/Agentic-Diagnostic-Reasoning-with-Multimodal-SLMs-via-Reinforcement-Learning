                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after interventional liver procedure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change.  Severe hyperexpansion of the lungs persists, without evidence of
 acute pneumonia, significant atelectasis, or pneumothorax.  Apical pleural
 changes are again noted.
