                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with sepsis/pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is obscured by pleuroparenchymal
 abnormalities.  Large left pleural effusion associated with adjacent
 atelectasis and small right effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis is
 unchanged.  There is mild vascular congestion.  ET tube is in standard
 position.  Right subclavian catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction/upper
 right atrium.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  There is a
 second esophageal catheter, the tip is at the level of the hemidiaphragm. 
 Left peripherally inserted catheter tip is in the axillary vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No interval change in bilateral pleural effusions and
 atelectasis.
