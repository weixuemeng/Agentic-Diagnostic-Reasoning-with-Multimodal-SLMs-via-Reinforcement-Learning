                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right-sided weakness and numbness. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays, most recently from ___
 and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated. No focal
 consolidation is seen.  No pleural effusions are seen.  Multiple vertebral
 body compression fractures are again noted, unchanged from prior studies. 
 Opacity in the left lower hemithorax does not have a correlation on lateral
 chest x-ray and likely it represents overlying soft tissue.  Cardiomegaly is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
