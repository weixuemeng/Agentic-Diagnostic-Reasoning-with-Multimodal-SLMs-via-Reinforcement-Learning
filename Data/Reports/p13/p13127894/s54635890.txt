 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is moderate diffuse predominantly central
 interstitial opacification with indistinct vessels suggesting pulmonary edema.
 A retrocardiac consolidation is present with air bronchograms.  There are also
 suspected pleural effusion on the right side and possibly a focal opacity is
 developing at the right lung base that may be due to early infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Consolidation suspected in the left lower lobe.
 
 3.  Patchy right lower lung opacification; an area of confluent edema could be
 considered versus an additional early developing focus of infection.
