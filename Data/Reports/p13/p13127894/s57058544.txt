                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and a series of older
 studies dating back to ___.  CTA of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A bedside AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates marked
 cardiomegaly as well as a moderate right and small left pleural effusion.  The
 left cardiac border and left hemidiaphragmatic contour remain obscured, likely
 by a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded depending on the clinical setting.  There is stable widening of
 mediastinum, consistent with elevated central venous pressure.  An
 endotracheal tube terminates no less than 1.5 cm above the carina with the
 patient's neck significantly flexed.  An OG tube courses into the stomach and
 out of field of view and a right PICC terminates within the right atrium, and
 could be pulled back 1.5 cm to ensure seatment in the lower one-third of the
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and
 pulmonary vascular congestion without evidence of pulmonary edema.
 2.  The right PICC lies within the right atrium and could be pulled back 1.5
 cm for proper positioning in the lower one-third of the SVC.
 
 NOTE:  Findings related to PICC positioning were communicated to the patient's
 nurse by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 13:00.
