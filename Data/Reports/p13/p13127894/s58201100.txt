                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
 in the right mainstem bronchus.  An orogastric tube passes into the stomach.
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar.  Better
 demonstrated is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchograms
 in the left lower lobe.  The right lung base appears less opacified than
 before, arguing against an addition focus of pneumonia in this area, although
 there is a persistent suspected pleural effusion based on veil-like layering. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema appears similar.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right main stem bronchus intubation with no other definite
 change.  Dr. ___ discussed the findings with Dr. ___ at 7:___ p.m. by
 telephone.
