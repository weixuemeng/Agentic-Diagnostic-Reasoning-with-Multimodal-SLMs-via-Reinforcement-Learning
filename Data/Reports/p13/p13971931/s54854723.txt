 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with 7 week Hx of persistent, nocturnal,
 nonproductive cough  // please assess cardiopulmonary architecture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   No prior study for comparison
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 hila, and pleural surfaces are normal.  On lateral view there is a 5 mm x 9 mm
 cavitary lesion at the level of the hemidiaphragm which may either represent a
 bronchus on-end versus an infectious process.  The lesion is not seen on
 anterior view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  5 mm x 9 mm cavitary lesion seen on lateral view (not seen on anterior
 view) is likely a bronchus on-end however cannot confidently rule out an
 infectious process given patient's cough symptoms.  Recommend chest CT for
 further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend chest CT for further evaluation.
