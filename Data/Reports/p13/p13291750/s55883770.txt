                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Prolonged respiratory illness and cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged but stable, predominantly left ventricle.  Elevated
 right hemidiaphragm is re-demonstrated, slightly more pronounced than on the
 prior study.  Assessment of the lateral view demonstrates suspected
 consolidation most likely in the right lower lobe that potentially might
 reflect atelectasis, but infectious process is a possibility.  In appropriate
 clinical set-up, re-assessment four weeks after completion of antibiotic
 therapy might be considered.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
