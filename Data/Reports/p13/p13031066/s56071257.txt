 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___

 The pulmonary vasculature is more engorged than on prior exams and there is
 cephalization of the vessels. The right mediastinum demonstrates increased
 prominence, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged compared to prior,
 and there is a right pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities are seen, right
 greater than left. The right pleural effusion accounts for at least some of
 the right base opacity, however cannot exclude underlying atelectasis,
 pneumonia, or aspiration in the right clinical setting. The left base opacity
 could also represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or aspiration in the right
 clinical setting. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, with right pleural effusion.
 
 2. Bibasilar opacities, part of which can be accounted for by the right
 pleural effusion, bibasilar consolidation due to pneumonia and/or aspiration
 may be present appropriate clinical setting.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly.
