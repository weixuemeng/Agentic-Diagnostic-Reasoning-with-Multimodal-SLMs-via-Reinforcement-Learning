                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with fall, question infection or injury.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  As seen on prior
 study, there is a right pleural effusion with right basal opacity likely
 atelectasis though cannot exclude pneumonia.  A retrocardiac density contains
 an air-fluid level, which reflects known hiatal hernia.  The left lung appears
 clear.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size appears grossly within
 normal limits, though the right heart border is poorly visualized.  The
 mediastinal contour appears normal.  The patient is slightly leftward rotated.
 The bones are demineralized and there may be a subtle fracture of the right
 posterior eighth rib.  Correlate for focal pain at this site.
