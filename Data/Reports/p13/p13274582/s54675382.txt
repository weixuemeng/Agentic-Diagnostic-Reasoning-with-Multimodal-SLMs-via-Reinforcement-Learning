                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, dyspnea on exertion  // Pulmonary edema,
 infiltrate, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Similar to the prior
 examination in ___, increased opacification involving the lateral right
 chest likely a combination of soft tissue and pleural thickening associated
 with chronic rib fractures.  The lungs are clear.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Clear lungs.  Opacity involving the base of
 the right lung laterally is likely related to pleural thickening associated
 with chronic rib fractures, stable from priors.
