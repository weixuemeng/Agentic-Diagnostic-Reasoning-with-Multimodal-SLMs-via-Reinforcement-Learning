                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Left PICC  // Reval Left PICC tip after cath
 exchange 55cm ___ ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low with left basilar atelectasis and a probable left
 effusion.  The patient is rotated which limits assessment.  A left-sided PICC
 now terminates in the proximal to mid SVC, the tip is difficult to visualize
 as it overlaps with 2 transvenous pacemaker wires.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment of the lung parenchyma appears grossly unchanged compared
 to the prior study.  A left-sided PICC terminates in the proximal to mid SVC,
 difficult to visualize.
