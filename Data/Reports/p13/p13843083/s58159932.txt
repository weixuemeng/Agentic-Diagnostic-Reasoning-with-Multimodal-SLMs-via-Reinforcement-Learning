 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:53 PM
  Extremely low lung volumes. There has been interval worsening of moderate to
  severe pulmonary alveolar edema with areas of more confluent consolidation.
  There are likely bilateral pleural effusions. Multi focal pneumonia cannot be
  excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna.  // worsening pna?      worsening pna?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are exceedingly low, exaggerating mild cardiomegaly, but
 pulmonary vasculature is more engorged than it was earlier.  Small right
 pleural effusion has grown.  There is a suggestion of the large hiatus hernia
 at the base of the left lung, and several more nodular areas of opacity in the
 right base. Overall, above the lung findings are nonspecific and confusing. 
 CT scanning would help conform likely bilateral pneumonia and cardiac
 decompensation.
 Transvenous atrioventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary
 generator.
