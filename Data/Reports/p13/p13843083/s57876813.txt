                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The radiograph is severely limited by patient positioning, with the majority
 of the right lung apex, and portion of left lung apex obscured by the
 patient's head and neck. Lungs demonstrate heterogeneous opacification
 bilaterally at the bases, as well as in the retrocardiac opacification. 
 Additionally, there is increased intersitial markings which may be compatible
 with edema.  The costophrenic angles are blunted bilaterally, right worse than
 left, indicate pleural effusion.
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged, and the cardiac pacemaker leads appear
 grossly in satisfactory position, however this is limited secondary to patient
 rotation.
 Osseous structures demonstrate significant osteopenia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited chest radiograph demonstrating bibasilar opacification, with small
 bilateral pleural effusions, concerning for infection on a background of mild
 pulmonary edema.
