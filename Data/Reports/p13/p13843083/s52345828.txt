                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HCAP vs CHF exacerbation and now increasing
 O2 requirement,  // Please eval for acute pulm process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are lower on the
 current study, accentuating the cardiomediastinal contours and resulting in
 greater crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Apparent worsening of
 pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema may reflect differences
 in lung volumes.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with worsening
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis or potentially aspiration in the
 setting of a large hiatal hernia.
