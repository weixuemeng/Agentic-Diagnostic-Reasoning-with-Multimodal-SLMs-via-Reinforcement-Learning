                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CAD and recent stroke now with pulmonary
 edema  // Assess interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, pulmonary edema has decreased in severity
 overall, but a confluent opacity in the right apex has apparently worsened. It
 is uncertain whether this reflects asymmetrical edema or superimposed process
 such as infectious pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are present, but there
 is no visible pneumothorax.
