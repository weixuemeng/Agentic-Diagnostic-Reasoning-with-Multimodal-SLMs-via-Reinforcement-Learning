                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with history of smoking.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low.  Horizontally oriented opacities are again noted at
 the left lung base and likely due to scarring.  There are no new opacities to
 suggest a focal mass or consolidation.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 appear stable.  There is stable elevation of the right hemi-diaphragm. No
 acute fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No findings to account for cough.
