  There are low lung volumes.  There is mild atelectasis at the left base.  Mild
  blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may represent small pleural effusion
  however this cannot be confirmed on the lateral radiograph as the posterior
  costophrenic sulci are omitted from view.  The remaining lung fields are
  clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
