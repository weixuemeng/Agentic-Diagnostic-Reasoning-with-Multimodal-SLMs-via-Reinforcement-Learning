                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute
 focal pneumonia.  Area of somewhat ill-defined opacification is seen in the
 left apical region laterally.  This could well represent some calcifications
 related to old tuberculous disease.  Comparison with previous studies from any
 outside facility would be most helpful.
