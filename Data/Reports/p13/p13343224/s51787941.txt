                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tightness and asthma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature shows
 perihilar fullness, upper zone re-distribution and indistinct contours, all
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity at the left lung base
 improved and may be due to residual atelectasis but not specific.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy left basilar
 opacity, which may be due to residual atelectasis at the left lung base.  If
 there is clinical concern for the possibility of developing infection,
 short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful.
