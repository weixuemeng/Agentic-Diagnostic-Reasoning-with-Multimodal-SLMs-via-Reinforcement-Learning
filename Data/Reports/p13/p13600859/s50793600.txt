                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___man with low oxygen saturation and chronic cough. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary pathology.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 A linear band of atelectasis or scarring at the base of the right lung is the
 only focal pulmonary abnormality seen on the frontal view.  The lateral
 suggests a small region of consolidation or atelectasis in the lingula or
 right middle lobe projecting over the cardiac silhouette.  Whether the middle
 lobe findings are acute or chronic is radiographically indeterminate.  An ___
 (left anterior oblique) view might be better for displaying the right middle
 lobe abnormality.  Lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural effusion
 or evidence of central adenopathy.  The ascending thoracic aorta is tortuous
 or dilated.  Heart size is normal and there is no evidence of central
 adenopathy.
