                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MI.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  There is increasing opacification at the
 right base obscuring the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and
 atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  Minimal atelectatic changes are seen
 on the left.
