                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable widening of right mediastinum, likely related to recent
 esophagectomy and pull-up procedure.  Right chest tube remains in place, with
 a residual tiny right apical pneumothorax, decreased from recent radiograph.
 Patchy and linear bibasilar atelectasis have minimally improved since the
 prior study.  Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
