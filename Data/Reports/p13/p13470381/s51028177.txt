                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with followup of pneumonia  // r/o pneumonia     
 r/o pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung
 volumes.  Cardio mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is some decrease
 in the multifocal opacities primarily in the right lung, which could reflect
 improving pneumonia or aspiration. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggests pleural fluid with underlying basilar atelectatic changes. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
