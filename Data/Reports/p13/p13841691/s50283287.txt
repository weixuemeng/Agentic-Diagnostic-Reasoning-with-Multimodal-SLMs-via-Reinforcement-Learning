                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderately severe pulmonary edema predominantly in a perihilar
 distribution.  Superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude,
 particularly at the lung bases.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggests at least a small pleural effusion.  No sizable pleural effusion on
 the right.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is enlarged.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderately severe pulmonary edema.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
