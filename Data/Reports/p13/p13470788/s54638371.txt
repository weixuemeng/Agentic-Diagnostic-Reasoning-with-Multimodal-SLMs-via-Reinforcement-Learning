                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute hypoxemia, basilar rales, stridor -
 eval for acute pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is indistinctness of the lung bases, likely
 due to pleural fluid at the posterior pleural surface.  The visualized lung
 parenchyma is clear and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Indistinctness of the lung bases may be due to pleural fluid in the posterior
 sulcus.  A lateral view would be helpful to exclude a small pleural effusion.
