                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hep C cirrhosis with chronic pancreatitis status post
 recent surgery with worsening abdominal pain, distention, cough, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  On the lateral
 view, there is a retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe which could
 represent a focus of pneumonia or atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Band-like opacity in the left lower lobe could represent an early
 pneumonia or atelectasis.
