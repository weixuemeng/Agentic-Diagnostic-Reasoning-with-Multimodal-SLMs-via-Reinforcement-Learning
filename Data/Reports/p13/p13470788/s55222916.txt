                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever and desaturation, evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral
 chest examination of ___.  The heart size is unchanged when
 compared to the previous study and accounted for difference related to PA
 versus AP technique.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  On preceding examination the patient had a plate basal
 left-sided atelectasis also identified on the lateral view.  Today's
 examination demonstrates bilateral plate atelectasis of similar appearance,
 now consistent of two atelectasis on the left base and two similar on the
 right base.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be identified and
 the lateral pleural sinuses are free.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in
 the apical area.  The described plate atelectasis are not conclusive finding
 for pneumonic infiltrates but can be explained by patient's shallow breathing.
