                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis now presenting with low-grade fever and
 acute episode of hypoxia and tachycardia.  Exam with bibasilar crackles and
 trace bilateral lower extremity edema.  Evaluate for infiltrate, fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extremely low lung volumes limit evaluation.  Left greater than right
 prominent basilar opacities, all potentially due to atelectasis are seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable given difference in technique.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extremely low lung volumes limit evaluation.  Left greater than right
 prominent basilar opacities all potentially due to atelectasis are noted.  To
 exclude consolidation, repeat exam with better inspiratory effort if the
 patient is amenable.
