                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post open cholecystectomy, evaluate pulmonary edema versus
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 2:40 a.m.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, lungs are slightly better aerated, though
 inspiratory volumes remain low.  There is upper zone redistribution, but I
 doubt CHF.  There is, however, patchy opacity at both lung bases, consistent
 with collapse and/or consolidation.  No effusion is seen.  
 
 Lateral view suggests some catheters or retained epidural pacing wires
 overlying the upper abdomen.  Please correlate clinically.
