                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion and syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral amorphous calcification projecting over the bilateral lung fields
 are most consistent with calcified pleural plaques, seen with prior asbestos
 exposure.  Basilar scarring/atelectasis is seen.  No focal consolidation,
 large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  There is mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body of indeterminate age. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral calcified pleural plaques suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
 
 Mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age.
 Recommend clinical correlation for acuity.
