                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of right pleural effusion and
 hydropneumothorax with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There is persistent blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle compatible with small residual pleural effusion,
 not significantly changed.  The size of the right apical pneumothorax is also
 unchanged.  Bilateral calcific densities projecting over lungs and the
 diaphragms are compatible with calcified pleural plaques.  Increased density
 seen projecting over the right lower lung similar to prior may also represent
 loculated fluid.  There is no new confluent consolidation.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications again noted at the aortic arch.  Surgical clips project over
 the neck on the left.  Hiatal hernia is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Persistent right pleural
 effusion at the base and likely loculated posteriorly and unchanged size of
 apical pneumothorax.  No definite superimposed acute process.
