                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Emphysema with increasing shortness of breath over the past 2 days,
 weakness, dysphagia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta noted.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with lucency in the lung apices compatible with emphysema. 
 Blunting of the costophrenic angles appears chronic, likely reflects chronic
 pleural thickening.  No pulmonary vascular engorgement is present.  There is
 no focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Emphysema.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
