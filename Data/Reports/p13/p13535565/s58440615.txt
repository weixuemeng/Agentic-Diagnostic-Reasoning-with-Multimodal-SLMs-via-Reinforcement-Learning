 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Cervical spinal hardware
 projects over the neck.  Minimal increased opacity on the frontal radiograph
 at the lung bases could represent a very early pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting.  Otherwise, no convincing evidence for pneumonia, edema,
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
