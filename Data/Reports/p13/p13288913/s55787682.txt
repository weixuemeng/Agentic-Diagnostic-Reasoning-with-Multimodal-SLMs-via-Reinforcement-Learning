                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, head injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle, unchanged.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis, slightly
 worse in the interval.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.  Fractures of the left sixth and seventh posterior ribs
 are subacute, seen on the previous examination.  No definite new osseous
 abnormalities detected.  Extensive degenerative changes are present involving
 both glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening opacities the lung bases likely reflective of increased atelectasis.
 Subacute left sixth and seventh posterior rib fractures, as seen previously.
