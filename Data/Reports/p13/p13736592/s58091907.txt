 longer visible.  Signs of mild fluid overload with resulting areas of
 atelectasis at overall very low lung volumes persist. No new parenchymal
 opacities. The tracheostomy tube is unchanged. The patient has received a
 right-sided PICC line. The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC. There
 is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
