                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Unresponsiveness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are low with patchy left lung opacities
 that are highly non-specific.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left lung opacities, but not extensive.  Atelectasis could
 be considered.  If there is concern for a developing pulmonary process, then
 short-term followup radiographs could be considered.
