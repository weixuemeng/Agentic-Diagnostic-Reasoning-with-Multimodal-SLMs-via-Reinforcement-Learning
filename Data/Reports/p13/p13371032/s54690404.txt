                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with septic shock and decompensated liver
 failure, intubated  // eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 10:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 04:47 is submitted.  There is
 substantial overlying motion artifact which limits evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach.  Bilateral
 linear opacities likely reflect scarring or atelectasis.  Due to the overlying
 motion, evaluation for subtle interval change cannot be assessed.  No obvious
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Right
 hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated.
