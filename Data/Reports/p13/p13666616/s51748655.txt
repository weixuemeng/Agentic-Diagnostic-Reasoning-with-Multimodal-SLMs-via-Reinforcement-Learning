                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fall injuring her left lower rib cage  //
 r/o pneumothorax      r/o pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An elliptical 11 mm wide opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the
 right fifth rib could be cartilage calcification.  Shallow oblique views
 recommended to exclude a lung nodule.
 
 Healed bilateral rib fractures are chronic, however there is a new fracture at
 the anterolateral aspect of the left eighth rib.
 
 Lungs are clear of any acute focal abnormality.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Thoracic aorta extremely tortuous
 but not dilated.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for
 detection or characterization of chest cage fractures or soft tissue
 abnormalities. If the demonstration additional chest cage abnormalities is
 clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings  should be
 clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
 
 Shallow oblique views to assess possible are new right lung nodule.
