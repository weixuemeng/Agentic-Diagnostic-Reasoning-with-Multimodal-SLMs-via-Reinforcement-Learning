                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with multiple rib fractures, evaluate
 rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding single view chest
 examination of ___.  The heart size remains normal.  Thoracic
 aorta moderately widened and rather markedly elongated but no local contour
 abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 Irregular peripheral pulmonary vascular distribution persists and coincides
 with low positioned and flattened diaphragms, all suggestive of rather
 advanced COPD.  Acute parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified.  There
 exists a right-sided chest wall deformity with multiple partially old rib
 deformities related to preceding traumata.  Comparison is made with the next
 preceding chest examination of ___. The at that time moderately
 dislodged rib portions belonging to the sixth and seventh right-sided rib
 anteriorly appear now in more proper anatomic alignment.  There is increasing
 soft tissue density surrounding these skeletal structures which probably
 caused by local pleural reactions as true osseous callus formation cannot be
 expected as yet.No pneumothorax or pulmonary infiltrates can be identified
 
 Observe also that previous chest examination indicated new trauma on ___ but apparently  also preexisting multiple rib deformities of older nature.
