                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable with the cardiac silhouette
 mildly enlarged and the central pulmonary vasculature appearing engorged.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal interstitial edema may be present.  No definite
 displaced fracture is seen; however, please note that CT is more sensitive in
 detecting rib, spine or sternal fractures.
