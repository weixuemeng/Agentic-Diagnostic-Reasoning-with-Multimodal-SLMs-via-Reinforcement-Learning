                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain.  Evaluation for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.  The right paratracheal stripe is
 enlarged, which may represent a dilated azygos vein from impeded venous return
 in the IVC shown on concurrent CT of the abdomen/pelvis.  Alternatively, this
 could be lymphadenopathy in this patient with presumed lymphoma.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated from massive splenomegaly with adjacent atelectasis.
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Excreted
 contrast within hydronephrotic left kidney is partially imaged.  There is no
 free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumoperitoneum.
