                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, abd pain diffusely, and hypotensive, evaluate for
 infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___
 2. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a right chest tunneled line with tip projecting over the low SVC
 versus cavoatrial junction.  An enteric tube courses inferiorly with distal
 tip projecting below the lower limit of the radiograph.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Hazy opacities at the right cardiophrenic angle are
 unchanged in comparison to prior exams and likely reflect superimposition of
 normal structures.  Retrocardiac opacity better seen on subsequent CT.  The
 hilar within normal limits.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac opacity better seen on subsequent CT which could represent
 infection and/or aspiration.
