                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Altered mental status and decreased breath sounds at the
 left base.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Low lung volumes are relatively
 unchanged over multiple prior studies.  There is no new focal opacity
 suggestive of pneumonia.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 likely due to overlying soft tissues.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no new opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
