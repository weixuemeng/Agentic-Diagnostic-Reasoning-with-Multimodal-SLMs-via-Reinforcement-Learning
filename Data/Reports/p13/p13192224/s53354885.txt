                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST of ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the expected location of the body of the right atrium and could be withdrawn
 several centimeters for standard positioning.  There is no visible
 pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette
 and bronchovascular structures.  Even allowing for this factor, there is
 likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion present.  Patchy areas of
 atelectasis have developed at both bases.  Questionable small left pleural
 effusion.
