                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain, seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated significantly to the left.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  There is patchy right
 basilar opacity which could be due to aspiration or infection.  There is also
 patchy left basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis, although
 aspiration at that location is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The patient is markedly rotated to the left mid, makes the
 evaluation suboptimal.  Given this, patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater
 than left, aspiration or infection not excluded.
