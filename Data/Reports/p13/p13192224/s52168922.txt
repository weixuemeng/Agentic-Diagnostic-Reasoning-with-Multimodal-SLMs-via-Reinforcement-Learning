                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:40 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with chest pain, seizures and desaturation.  Suspect
 aspiration or pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are chronically low, due in part or contributing to gaseous
 distention of the gut in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, also
 chronic.  Heart size is normal.  Widening of the upper mediastinum is due to
 fat deposition.  Aside from new mild bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are
 clear.  This could be a manifestation of aspiration, so followup is advised. 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
