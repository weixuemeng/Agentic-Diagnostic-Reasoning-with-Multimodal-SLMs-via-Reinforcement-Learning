                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Opacification lying posterior to the left hemidiaphragm is non-specific;
 noting low lung volumes, opacity could potentially be seen with atelectasis,
 but may reflect bronchopneumonia, best seen on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left posterior basilar opacity, possibly pneumonia.
