                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypothermia, altered mental status, status
 post 3-cm retraction of nasogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  11:45 this morning.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two portable frontal chest radiographs were obtained.  A
 nasoenteric tube coils once in the fundus of the stomach and extends
 inferiorly.  The right internal jugular catheter tip is at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Lung volumes are low which accentuates the pulmonary vasculature. 
 No new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasoenteric tube projects over the expected position of the
 stomach.
