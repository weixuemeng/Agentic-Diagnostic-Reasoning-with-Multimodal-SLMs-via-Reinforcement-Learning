  prior examinations from the same date, concerning for aspiration or edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS s/p intubation  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 13:21.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube ends approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 courses below the level of the diaphragm and off the inferior aspect of the
 film.  A right IJ line ends in the low SVC.  The heart size is within normal
 limits.  Increasing ill-defined opacities are noted within the lung bases,
 more so on the right, along with perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2. Worsening ill-defined opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right. 
 While this may reflect aspiration pneumonia, an element of asymmetric
 pulmonary edema is also likely present given rapid interval worsening.
