 INDICATION:  Hypothermia with seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Right basilar linear opacity may
 represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  The remainder of the lungs is clear.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal allowing for patient
 position and technique.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar atelectasis or pneumonia. If further evaluation is
 needed, consider conventional PA and lateral radiographs in radiology. No
 effusion.
