 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the region of
 the pulmonary valve.  A right-sided supraclavicular subclavian line is seen
 with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.  A right internal jugular central
 venous line terminates at the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen with tip outside the borders of this image. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen at the level of the thoracic inlet, but is more than
 7 cm above the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Swan Ganz catheter ends in the region of the pulmonary valve; correlate
 with tracing for specific localization of position.
 
 3.  Endotracheal tube is seen with the tip at the thoracic inlet, but is more
 than 7 cm from the carina.  Advance 3-4 cm for a more secured seating.
