                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dobbhoff
 tube is seen, distal aspect not well appreciated, courses below the level of
 the diaphragm but the distal aspect is not well appreciated due to
 underpenetration from overlying soft tissues.  There is a right-sided central
 venous catheter which terminates in the region of the proximal SVC/SVC
 brachiocephalic junction.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Subtle
 opacity projecting over the right lung base is stable and may be due to
 vascular structures in combination with atelectasis.  Left base
 atelectasis/scarring is again seen  Calcified left hilar nodes are again seen.
 The hilar contours are stable.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Aorta
 remains tortuous.
