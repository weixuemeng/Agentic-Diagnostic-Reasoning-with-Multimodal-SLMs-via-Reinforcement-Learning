                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pneumothorax, re-evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities
 at both lung bases have improved and are smaller in extent and severity.  It
 is confirmed that the right linear lucency did not represent a pneumothorax,
 but rather was a skinfold creating an artifact.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
