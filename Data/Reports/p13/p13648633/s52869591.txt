                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New orogastric tube.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Same day chest radiograph at 10:47 AM.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Orogastric tube passes into the stomach
 with its tip beyond the limits of the film.  Endotracheal tube is in unchanged
 position with its tip at the level of the superior margin of the clavicles. 
 Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary artery, similar to
 prior.  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Right subclavian catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes
 remain low with bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  OG tube passes into the stomach with its tip beyond the limits of the
 film.  
 
 2.  ET tube and Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position.  Advancement of
 the ET tube by 2-3 cm and withdrawal of the Swan-___ catheter by 3-4 cm is
 again recommended.
