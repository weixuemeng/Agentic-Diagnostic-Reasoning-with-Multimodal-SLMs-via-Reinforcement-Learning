                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with HCV cirrhosis and
 portopulmonary hypertension.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Central venous line tip terminates at the level of superior SVC.  The Dobbhoff
 tube is most likely present, projecting over the expected location of the
 esophagus.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Calcifications in the left
 hilus most likely consistent with prior granulomatous exposure.  Bibasilar
 opacities appear to be slightly more pronounced and may be consistent with
 infectious process.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
