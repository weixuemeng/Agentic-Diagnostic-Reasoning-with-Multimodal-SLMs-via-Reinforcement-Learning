 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the previous PICC line on the

 line projects over the mid SVC.  The previously placed left central venous
 catheter has been removed.  The lung volumes remain low.  There are areas of
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or other complications.
