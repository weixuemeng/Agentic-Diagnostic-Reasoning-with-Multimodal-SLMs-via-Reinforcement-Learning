 AP CHEST, 6:43 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  Check PICC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.  PICC position is stable
 low in the SVC.  Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. 
 Borderline cardiomegaly is stable.  Irregular opacification in the lower lungs
 is largely due to chronically enlarged pulmonary vessels.  A small region of
 new consolidation or peribronchial infiltration would be easy to miss.  ___
 lungs are clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of central
 adenopathy.  Left hilus is larger than the right by virtue of calcified lymph
 nodes.
