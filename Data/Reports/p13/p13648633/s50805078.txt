  Right central line terminates in the mid to distal superior vena cava. 
  Location of the Dobbhoff tip cannot be reliably assessed given body habitus. 
  Repeat abdominal radiograph would be helpful.  Improved bilateral lower lobe
  opacities without focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  No
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right-sided central venous access line.  The tip of the line projects over the
 mid to lower SVC.  The Dobbhoff catheter is unchanged, the tip cannot be
 reliably visualized.  The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the lung bases
 have almost completely resolved.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
