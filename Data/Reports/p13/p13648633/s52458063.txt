 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff catheter, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 new Dobbhoff catheter.  The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip is
 positioned in the stomach.  No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
 
 The bilateral basal opacities, right more than left, are unchanged.  A
 previously placed right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed and
 replaced by a right PICC line.  Tip of the line projects over the lower SVC. 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
