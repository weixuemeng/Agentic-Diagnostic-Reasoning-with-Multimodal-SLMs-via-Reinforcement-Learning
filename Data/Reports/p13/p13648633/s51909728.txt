                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with coarse breath sounds and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___, dating back to
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted are bilateral lower lobe opacities, which have been
 present on multiple prior studies, including a CT from ___. 
 These were characterized as multifocal pneumonia.  The upper lobes are clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal, as is the
 pulmonary vasculature.  There is a nasogastric tube terminating within the
 stomach and a tunneled central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe opacities in a pattern similar to multiple
 prior images, consistent in appearance with multifocal pneumonia.  Consider
 non-emergent, outpatient evaluation with CT to further assess in the setting
 of nonresolving opacity.
