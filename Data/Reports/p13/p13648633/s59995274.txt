 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, fluid overload.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a linear lucency
 paralleling the right chest wall, caused by a skinfold.  The lucency mimicking
 a pneumothorax, but there is no real pneumothorax.
 
 The lung volumes continue to be low.  The relatively extensive atelectasis at
 the left lung base and the pre-existing opacities at the right lung base are
 constant in extent and severity.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
