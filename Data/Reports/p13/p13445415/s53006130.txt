                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD s/p cath c/o productive cough  //
 ?pneumonia      ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a cardiac device generator in the right chest wall with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 There is improved aeration of the upper left lung with resolution of
 previously described ill-defined interstitial and patchy airspace opacities.
 Bibasilar opacities are grossly unchanged including abscess duration of the
 medial left hemidiaphragm. There is unchanged blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, pulmonary vasculature,
 and aorta are within normal limits.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Resolution of previously described left upper lung interstitial opacities.
 2. Unchanged bibasilar opacities including retrocardiac opacification may
 represent atelectasis, however in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
