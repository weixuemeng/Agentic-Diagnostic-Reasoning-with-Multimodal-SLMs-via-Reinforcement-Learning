                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post right pigtail placement, the patient with
 history of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax.  Right pigtail catheter remains in
 unchanged position.  Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Right
 lower lobe opacities have improved consistent with decreasing in atelectasis
 and pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly is severe and stable.  Moderate-to-large
 left pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.  There are no new lung abnormalities.
