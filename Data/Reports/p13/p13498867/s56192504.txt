                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with irregular heart rate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac outline is severely enlarged.  Calcifications are noted
 at the aortic arch.  The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is again
 identified and may be due to pleural scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severely enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  While this
 enlargement in comparison to prior study may be due to lower lung volumes, a
 pericardial effusion and myocarditis must be excluded in the proper clinical
 setting.
