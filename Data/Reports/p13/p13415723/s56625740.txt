 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively, appears unchanged.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 diffuse mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality appears more prominent than
 on the prior examination.  There may be trace pleural effusions.  Fissures are
 slightly thickened.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema but somewhat increased
 in severity.
