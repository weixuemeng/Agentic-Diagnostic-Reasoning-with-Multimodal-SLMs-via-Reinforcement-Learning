 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ and
 ___.
 
 Lung volumes have improved substantially since ___ and previous right
 pleural effusion has almost entirely resolved.  There are some unusual
 findings at the base of the right lung, probably a large band of atelectasis
 (perhaps even collapsed right middle lobe) and, and, medial to that, a round
 roughly 3.5 cm opacity which could be atelectasis or a lung mass, previously
 obscured by consolidation one the patient had a chest CT on ___.  Now
 would be a good time to repeat the chest CT.  Left lung is clear,
 hyperinflated suggesting COPD.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, but smaller
 today than in the past.  There is no pulmonary edema currently.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
