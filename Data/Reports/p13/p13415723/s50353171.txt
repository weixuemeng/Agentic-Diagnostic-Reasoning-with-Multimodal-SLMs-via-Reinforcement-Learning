                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but has decreased in size
 compared to the prior study.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has also improved,
 along with rapidly improving right upper juxtahilar opacity, with some
 residual predominantly linear opacities remaining in this region.  Minimal
 linear areas of atelectasis are demonstrated in the lingula and left lower
 lobe, and note is also made of small bilateral pleural effusions.  Permanent
 pacemaker remains in standard position with leads in right atrium and right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improving pulmonary vascular congestion.  Rapidly resolving right juxtahilar
 opacity, favoring either asymmetrical edema or acute aspiration over an
 infectious pneumonia.  Continued radiographic followup may be helpful to
 document complete resolution.
