                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall, evaluate for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion is decreased compared with the prior study, now
 mild.  Previously seen pulmonary edema has resolved.  Opacity in the right
 lower lobe is increased from the immediate prior radiograph, similar to ___.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for AP technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right lower lobe opacity is increased from the immediate prior study may
 represent pneumonia, atelectasis, or aspiration.
 2. Interval decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion and resolution of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The updated impression above was entered by Dr. ___
 ___ on ___ at 17:14 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
