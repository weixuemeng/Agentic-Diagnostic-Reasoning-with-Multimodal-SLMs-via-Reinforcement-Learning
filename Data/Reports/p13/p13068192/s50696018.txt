                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with headache
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous, with
 pronounced ascending aortic contour, as seen previously.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Unchanged prominence of the ascending
 aortic contour which may reflect dilatation or aneurysm.  As recommended
 previously, a nonemergent chest CTA can be obtained for further assessment if
 there are no remote radiographs available for comparison.
