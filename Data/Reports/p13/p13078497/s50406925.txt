                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, history of CHF and pneumonia, recently
 extubated, now desating.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an increase in the bilateral pulmonary edema status
 post extubation as evidenced by increased dense opacification, which is now
 nearly confluent consistent with severe pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate given intervening
 pulmonary edema opacity, however appears unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 There has been complete obscuration of the costophrenic angles suggestive of
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Right IJ catheter is unchanged in position and
 ends in the upper SVC.  Sternotomy wires are unchanged in position, aligned
 along the midline with no evidence of sternal dehiscence.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening, now severe, bilateral pulmonary edema. Supervening
 pneumonia can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Interval removal of endotracheal tube.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.
