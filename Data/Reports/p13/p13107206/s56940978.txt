  Rounded opacity in the right lung base concerning for right middle lobe
  pneumonia.  Finding is progressed compared with prior studies and may
  represent relapsing pneumonia or a slow growing underlying pulmonary lesion. 
  Recommend nonemergent chest CT for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with malaise evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A rounded density in the right lower lung is compatible with a right middle
 lobe pneumonia.  Given that there has been increasing density in the right
 lung base compared with prior studies dating back to ___, nonemergent chest
 CT is recommended for further evaluation.  There is minimal left lung base
 pleural thickening.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Underlying
 moderate emphysema has progressed slightly compared with prior studies.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rounded opacity in the right lung base concerning for a right middle lobe
 pneumonia.  Finding is progressed compared with prior studies and may
 represent relapsing pneumonia or a slow growing underlying pulmonary lesion. 
 Recommend nonemergent chest CT for further evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation
 of right lower lung opacity.
