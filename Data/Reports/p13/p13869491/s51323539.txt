                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pulled hemodialysis line with the bleeding.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  The chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A double lumen catheter has been retracted mostly out of the chest. Its tip
 now terminates over the right upper hemithorax, almost definitely
 extravascular and probably within overlying soft tissues rather than within
 the chest cavity.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 The lungs appear clear aside from minimal streaky left lower lung atelectasis
 with plate-like morphology.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Malpositioned central venous catheter.  No evidence of acute disease.
