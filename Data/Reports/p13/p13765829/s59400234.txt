                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough x5 weeks, shortness of breath.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or
 effusion is detected. Again noted is slight anterior wedging of a lower
 thoracic vertebral body, question T12, with loss of height of approximately
 ___%.   Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  
 
 At the upper edge of these films, there is an irregular, somewhat spiculated
 focal density measuring roughly 13 mm in diameter that lies to the left of the
 lower cervical spine, over the soft tissues of the neck.  This may represent
 artifact due to overlying materials, but clinical correlation to assess for a
 palpable soft tissue nodule is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute pulmonary process identified.  The appearance of the chest is
 similar to ___.
 2.  Anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body, ? T12, unchanged,
 consistent with an old vertebral body compression fracture.
 3.  Question artifact due to overlying material versus nodular density over
 the left lower neck.  Correlation with physical exam is requested.
