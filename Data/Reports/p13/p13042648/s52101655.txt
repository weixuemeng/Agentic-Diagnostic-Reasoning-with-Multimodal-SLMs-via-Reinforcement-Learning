                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with infection of lungs  // Assess lungs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, widespread consolidation in the
 right lung has worsened with only a small amount of residual aerated lung
 centrally in the right upper lobe.  Homogeneous opacity in the right mid and
 lower lung likely represents a combination of middle and lower lobe collapse
 as well as at least a moderate right pleural effusion.  Within the left lung,
 worsening pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by moderate edema,
 worsening left retrocardiac atelectasis, and a small left pleural effusion.
