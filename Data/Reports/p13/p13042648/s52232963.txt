 reasonably well aerated.  Moderate right pleural effusion is now revealed. 
 Consolidation on the left is relatively mild, mostly in the lower lobe.  The
 widespread multifocal pneumonia is presumably explained by the previous
 demonstration of bronchial occlusion from secretions by CT scanning in ___.
 
 Transesophageal tube passes into a nondistended stomach.  ET tube in standard
 placement.  Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.  Heart size normal.
