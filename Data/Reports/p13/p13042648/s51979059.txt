                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate more extensive
 consolidation in areas previously abnormal in ___, but largely cleared
 a month ago, worst in the right middle and lower lobes, less extenive in the
 left lower lobe.  The geographic and temporal pattern suggests a tendency to
 pneumonia, most commonly aspiration.  Hyperexpansion from known emphysema is
 also appreciated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Recurrent right upper and bilater lower lobe pneumonia.  Suggest
 followup radiographs in no more than 6 weeks to document clearing.  Barium
 swallow would be indicated if there is clinical evidence of esophageal
 dysfunction of any sort.
