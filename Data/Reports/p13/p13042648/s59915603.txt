                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA intubated  // interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 333
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, the appearances are similar to the prior study.
 
 The opacities in the right lung are slightly improved.  The previously seen
 question temperature probe is no longer visualized.  Otherwise, lines and
 tubes and parenchymal findings are similar to the prior study.  As before, the
 left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic sulcus are excluded from the film.
 
 
 Incidental note is made of well corticated tapering of both collapse distal
 clavicles, question postsurgical.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very slight interval improvement in right lung opacities.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
