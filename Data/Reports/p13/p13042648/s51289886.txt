                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were performed.  The lungs are
 hyperexpanded from known emphysema.  Consolidation at the lung base, side
 indeterminate, is best appreciated on the lateral view, si  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Degenerative changes of
 the shoulders are appreciated.  The bones are osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION: Recurrent lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup radiographs in 6 weeks
 are recommended to document resolution.
