                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CHF, mucus plug on CT chest  // reason
 for worsening dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased lung volume on the
 right, associated with a decrease in extent of the pre-existing pleural
 effusion and subsequent atelectasis. However, moderate cardiomegaly is still
 present and rather extensive areas of atelectatic lung portions at the lung
 bases are unchanged. Moderate peribronchial cuffing at the level of the hilar
 structures could suggest mild interstitial fluid overload.  No pneumothorax.
