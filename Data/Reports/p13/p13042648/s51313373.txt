 right upper lobe remains partially aerated. This overall appearance could
 represent effusion and consolidation though underlying malignancy is
 impossible to exclude. A small left effusion is also noted. The left lung is
 grossly clear. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour is difficult
 to assess given adjacent opacity and slight rightward mediastinal shift. Bony
 structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consolidation in the right mid to lower lung is new from prior exam and may
 represent consolidation/pneumonia with effusion though underlying malignancy
 impossible to exclude. Small left effusion. Consider CT to further assess.
 Followup to resolution advised.
