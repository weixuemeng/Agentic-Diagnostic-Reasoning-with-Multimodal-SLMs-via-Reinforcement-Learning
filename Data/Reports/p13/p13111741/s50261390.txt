                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post esophagectomy in ___.  Presents with
 cough and rhonchi.  Evaluation for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  New opacity in the right middle lobe and lower lobes could
 represent post-surgical scarring; however, an acute process including
 infection and aspiration cannot be excluded.  The right costophrenic angle is
 blunted, which could represent a small pleural effusion. The left lung and the
 left costophrenic angle are clear.  Intact median sternotomy wires are
 redemonstrated as well as left mediastinal clips.  The aorta is calcified. 
 The heart size is normal.  The previously seen pneumoperitoneum and
 subcutaneous emphysema have resolved.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity in the right middle and lower lobes may represent
 scarring from the patient's prior esophagectomy, infection and/or aspiration.
 Small right pleural effusion.
