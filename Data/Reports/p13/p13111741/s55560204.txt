                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and central venous catheter remain in standard
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Widespread bilateral
 airspace opacities are relatively stable in the right lung, but have worsened
 in the left lung in the interval.  Moderate right pleural effusion is
 unchanged, but there has been apparent slight increase in size of a small left
 pleural effusion.
