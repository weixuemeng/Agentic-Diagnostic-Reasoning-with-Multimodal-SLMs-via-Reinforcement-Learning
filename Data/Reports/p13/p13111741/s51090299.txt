                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ARDS, intubated with ET tube reposition.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 06:05.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the level of
 the carina, top normal.  Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter
 is stable.  Extensive bilateral opacities appear minimally increased compared
 to the prior study.  However, lung volumes are also lower which likely
 accentuate this.  Bilateral pleural effusions also appear increased.
