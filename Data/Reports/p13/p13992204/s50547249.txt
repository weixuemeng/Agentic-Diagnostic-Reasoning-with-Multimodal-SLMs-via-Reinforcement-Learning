                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  A nodular density in
 the left upper lung zone is likely an engorged vessel, as it was present on
 prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema, consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The size
 of the cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and unchanged from the prior
 exam.  There is atherosclerosis in the aortic arch.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  Posterior fusion hardware of the lower thoracic and
 upper lumbar spine is visualized, but not completely evaluated.  There has
 been no significant change from the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without evidence of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Moderate stable cardiomegaly.
