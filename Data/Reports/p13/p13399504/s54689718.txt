                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year-old gentleman with a history of T2DM, GWS s/p partial
 gastrectomy c/b gastroparesis who is being transferred back to the ICU given
 recurrence of respiratory distress as well as anion gap metabolic acidosis
 which now closed, now w/ hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube appropriately positioned ending approximately 6.3 cm above
 the carina.  A nasoenteric tube coils in the stomach.  A right PICC ends in
 the low SVC.  Multifocal airspace opacity appears improved from prior, however
 this likely relates to increased lung volumes.  Pleural effusion is small, if
 any.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multiple bullet fragments project over the
 left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No large interval change in multifocal airspace opacity given differences in
 technique.  Appropriate positioning of monitoring and support devices.
