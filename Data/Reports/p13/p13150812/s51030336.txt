  Extremely low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
  vasculature.  Heart size is likely normal given low volumes and AP technique. 
  The lungs are clear.  No definite fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib and bili pain question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lung volumes are low which limits assessment of cardiac size.  No overt
 fractures or pneumothorax are identified.  Rounded opacity is seen projecting
 in the region of the right lower hilum.  This is likely due to overlapping
 vasculature but a follow up study when the patient is able to take a large
 breath would be helpful for further assessment.
