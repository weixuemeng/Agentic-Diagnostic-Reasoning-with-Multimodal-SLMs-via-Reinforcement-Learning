                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Head bleed, intubated in room 23B.  Evaluate for tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube terminates 3.2 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube courses
 below the left hemidiaphragm with side port likely in the stomach and tip
 beyond the field of view.  There is large left retrocardiac opacity with
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely reflecting some combination of
 pleural effusion, atelectasis and possible pneumonia.  There is no large
 pneumothorax.  The right lung is essentially clear.  There is mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Large left retrocardiac opacity may reflect pleural effusion, aspiration
 or atalectasis; pneumonia is not excluded.
