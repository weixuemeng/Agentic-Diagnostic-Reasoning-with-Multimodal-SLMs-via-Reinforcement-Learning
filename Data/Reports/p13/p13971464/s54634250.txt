                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is mild to moderately
 tortuous.  A smooth convexity to the right upper lateral mediastinum is most
 commonly due to tortuosity of the great vessels.  The lungs appear clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Air beneath the medial left
 hemidiaphragm is probably due to gastric air, but in addition, there are
 distended loops of small bowel that are partly visualized in the left upper
 quadrant that are nonspecific and not entirely evaluated.  The partly
 visualized left shoulder shows a substantial degenerative change.  Mild
 degenerative changes affect the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Mild to moderately distended small bowel in the left upper quadrant. 
 Clinical correlation is suggested.  Further imaging could be considered if
 abdominal pathology is suspected.
