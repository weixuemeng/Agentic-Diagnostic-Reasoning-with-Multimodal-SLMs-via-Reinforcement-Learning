 noted, but otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  There is some tracheal deviation consistent with patient's history
 of multinodular goiter.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube with tip above the GE junction.  Tube needs to
 be advanced at least 10 cm.  Otherwise, normal chest radiograph.
