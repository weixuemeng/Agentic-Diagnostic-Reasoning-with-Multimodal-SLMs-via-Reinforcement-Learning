 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, cough  // Assess for worsening
 pneumonia

 As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has
 not changed. Visible on the lateral radiograph only is a moderate left lower
 lobe parenchymal opacity, likely to reflect pneumonia.  The opacity is not
 well visible on the frontal image, given the simultaneous presence of a large
 hiatal hernia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
