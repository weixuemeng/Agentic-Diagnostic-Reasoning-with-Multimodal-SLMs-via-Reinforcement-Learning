                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure and mental status change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A patchy opacity
 projecting over the left mid lung, probably in the lingula, suggests minor
 unchanged atelectasis.  Although the deep posterior costophrenic sulci are
 partly excluded on the lateral view, there is no indication for pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
