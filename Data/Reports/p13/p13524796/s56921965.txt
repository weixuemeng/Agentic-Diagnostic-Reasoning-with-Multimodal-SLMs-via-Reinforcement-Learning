                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with decreased breath sounds at the left base,
 question pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary vascular abnormality, edema
 or pleural effusion.  Mild increase in radiopacity in the right mid lung
 accompanied by elevation of the minor fissure suggests upper lobe scarring. 
 The lesser oblique views would be helpful in localization and characterization
 to determine if there is a need to compare with prior studies or obtain
 additional imaging.  There is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement. 
 There is no abnormality at the lung bases, either pleural or pulmonary. 
 Findings were posted to the online record of critical imaging findings for
 direct notification of the referring physician, at the time of dictation.
