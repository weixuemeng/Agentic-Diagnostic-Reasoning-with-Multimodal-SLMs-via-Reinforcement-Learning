                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of pneumonia, now with continued dyspnea,
 cough, although mildly improving.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again, as on
 the prior study, there is a region of irregular peribronchial opacification in
 the right upper lobe which persists, but appears less confluent as compared to
 the prior study.  Left infrahilar opacity is again seen which also appears
 less confluent as compared to the prior study.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette top normal
 to mildly enlarged and the aorta calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right upper lung and left infrahilar opacities appear
 less confluent as compared to the prior study one week prior.  Recommend
 continued followup to resolution.
