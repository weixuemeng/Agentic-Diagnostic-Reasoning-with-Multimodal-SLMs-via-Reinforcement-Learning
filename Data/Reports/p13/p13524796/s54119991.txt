                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are well
 expanded with persistent linear opacities in the right upper lobe, unchanged
 since ___, likely scarring.  The heart is moderately enlarged and
 unchanged.  No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia is identified.  A 9 mm rounded radiodensity
 projecting over the right lower lobe is possibly summation artifact or a
 nipple shadow, although the left is not visualized.   should not be confused
 for a pulmonary nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly and right upper
 lobe scarring.
 2. 9 mm radiodensity projecting over the right lower lobe is possibly
 summation artifact or a nipple shadow rather than a nodule, and could be
 differentiated with shallow oblique radiographs.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 7:40 am, within ___ min of discovery.
