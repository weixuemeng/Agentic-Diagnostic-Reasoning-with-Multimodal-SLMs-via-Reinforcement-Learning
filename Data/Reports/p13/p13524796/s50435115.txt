                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough for three weeks.  Yellow sputum.  Former
 smoker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 A region of irregular peribronchial opacification in the right upper lobe,
 probably along the major fissure in the axillary subsegments has grown more
 radiodense.  The configuration suggests bronchiectasis.  In the perihilar left
 mid lung is a new region of consolidation, more typical of pneumonia. 
 Overall, hyperinflation and the chest cage configurations suggest emphysema. 
 Lateral view shows a new band of atelectasis in one of the lower lobes,
 probably the left.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
