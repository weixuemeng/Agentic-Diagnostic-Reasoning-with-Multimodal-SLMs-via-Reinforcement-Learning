                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male unable to ambulate or sit up for at least three
 days.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is unchanged appearance of the
 left base.  While some of this density may be accounted for by elevated
 hemidiaphragm, there is also increased retrocardiac opacity.  Left effusion is
 suspoected given presence on prior with similar appearance on the frontal
 view.  Mild cardiomegaly is also stable from prior.  There is no pneumothorax.
 No mediastinal widening is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Left base opacity as described above
 and similar to prior.  Suspect underlying effusion and atelecatsis although
 infection is not excluded.  Consider PA and lateral views to further
 charcterize when patient is amenable.
