                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ facial fractures, rib fractures, clavicle fx,  left
 proximal humerus, and high transverse femur fractures s/p high-speed MVC as
 well as questionable ICH.  // eval ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph of earlier today, an endotracheal tube has been
 placed, terminating 5.4 cm above the carinal.  Exam is otherwise remarkable
 for worsening opacity in the right lower hemithorax, probably a combination of
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis and or aspiration.  New linear
 atelectasis has developed at the left base. No additional relevant changes
 since recent radiograph.
