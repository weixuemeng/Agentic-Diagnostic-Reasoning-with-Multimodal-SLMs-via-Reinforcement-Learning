                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath on oral chemotherapy.  Rule out pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a retrocardiac consolidation on the lateral view with air
 bronchograms, possibly localizing to the right lung, which could represent
 pneumonia. There is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size
 is difficult to assess given the ongoing parenchymal abnormality. Splaying of
 the carina with narrowing of the mainstem bronchi is compatible with known
 lymphadenopathy, which is better evaluated on the prior CTA chest.  Clips are
 seen in the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac consolidation would be compatible with pneumonia.  Progression
 of disease would be difficult to exclude.
 2. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy from ___, accounting for
 differences in technique.
