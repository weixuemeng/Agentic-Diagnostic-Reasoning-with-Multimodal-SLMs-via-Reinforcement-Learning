                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with SOB  // effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___, ___, and chest CT
 from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath is again noted. Streaky right middle lobe opacity is likely
 in part due to atelectasis. Bulky right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy was
 better seen by prior cross-sectional imaging. There is however new
 retrocardiac opacity which is only clearly seen on the frontal view. A left
 apical opacity is again seen and could be due to prior radiation. There is no
 effusion. Surgical clips again project over the left axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity seen only on the frontal view could be due to atelectasis
 although infection is not entirely excluded.  Otherwise, no significant
 interval change including streaky right middle lobe opacity and
 mediastinal/hilar adenopathy.
