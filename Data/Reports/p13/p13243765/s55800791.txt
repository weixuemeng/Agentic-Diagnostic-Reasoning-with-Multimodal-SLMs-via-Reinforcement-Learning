                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Both lungs show mild hyperinflation with no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle on the lateral
 view may indicate trace right pleural effusion. Opacities in both mid lung
 zones are likely nipple shadows.
