                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG/AVR/open chest  // eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.9 cm above the carina.  An enteric
 type tube is present, tip extends beneath the diaphragm, but cannot be traced
 beyond this.  Bilateral left-sided chest tubes are present.   A left IJ
 central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  A right sided dual lead
 pacemaker is present, with lead tips overlying the right atrium an right
 ventricle.  There is an apparent prosthetic aortic valve with? a coronary
 artery stent versus heavily calcified coronary artery.  Thin tubing overlies
 the right axilla, but no PICC line is seen within the chest.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but probably unchanged allowing for
 technique.  There is mild vascular plethora and vascular blurring, with
 thickening of the minor fissure, consistent with CHF.  Equivocal small
 bilateral effusions.
 
 At the edge of these films, note is made of a spinal fixation device and
 bilateral carotid artery calcifications.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis.  Possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate,
 particularly in the left retrocardiac region, cannot be excluded.
 2. CHF with interstitial edema.  The appearance is likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.
 3. Lines and tubes, as described.
 4. Thin linear tubing overlying the right axilla.  Of note, however, no PICC
 line is seen within the chest.  Clinical correlation is requested as, if there
 is a right-sided PICC line present, it does not extend into the SVC.  (This
 latter finding was discussed with ___, the nurse caring for the patient, by
 Dr. ___ by phone at 7:24 pm on ___, several minutes after discovery. 
 He indicated that patient does not have a PICC line.) The etiology of this
 material remains unknown.
