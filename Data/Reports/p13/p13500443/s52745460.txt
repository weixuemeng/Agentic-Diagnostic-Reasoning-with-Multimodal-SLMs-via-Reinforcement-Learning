                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain, ESRD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Mild
 pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular
 indistinctness. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Cervical
 spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed. No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
