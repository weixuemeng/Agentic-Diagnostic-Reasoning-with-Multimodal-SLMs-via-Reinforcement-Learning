                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Heart block.  Dual-chamber pacemaker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Cannot be sure whether there is a small left apical pneumothorax.  I would
 recommend a repeat frontal chest radiograph, carefully positioned, with no
 overlying garments.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably residual
 of previous episodes of congestive failure.  Heart size is now normal and
 there is no pulmonary edema.  Mild left basal atelectasis is still present.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses from the left axillary pacemaker.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
