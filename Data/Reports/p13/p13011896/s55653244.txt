                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.1 cm above the level of the
 carina, in appropriate position.  A right-sided internal jugular central
 venous catheter is seen, which appears slightly high in position, terminating
 in the region of the right innominate vein/right internal jugular/innominate
 vein junction.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings.  The superior mediastinum appears widened, which may
 be accentuated by AP technique, supine position; if there is clinical concern
 for acute aortic process, suggest chest CTA.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis seen.
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the right
 innominate vein/innominate-internal jugular junction, high in position.
 3.  Widening of the superior mediastinum may in part relate to AP technique,
 supine position; however, if there is concern for acute aortic process,
 suggest chest CTA.
 4.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
