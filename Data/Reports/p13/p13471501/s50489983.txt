                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dysphagia after dilatation of the esophagus.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CTA ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in
 the lower SVC.  The cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits.  Compared
 to the prior chest radiograph, there is improvement in aeration of the right
 infrahilar region, with continued small right, and small to moderate sized
 left, bilateral pleural effusions, similar in size compared to the prior exam.
 Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis and is relatively unchanged. 
 Emphysematous changes are most pronounced in the lung apices.  No
 pneumomediastinum is definitively noted, and there is no pneumothorax. 
 Compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  Multiple
 clips are demonstrated projecting over the left posterior chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence for pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the right infrahilar region, with
 continued bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis, though
 infection cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right
 and small to moderate on the left, are similar compared to prior exam.
