                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs, with most recent from ___.  Concurrently
 chest CTs from ___ and ___ were reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at lower SVC.  Since ___, moderate left pleural effusion which is partially loculated and left
 basilar consolidations have unchanged; however, the right infrahilar
 consolidation and probable small right pleural effusion has worsened.  Upper
 lungs remain clear.  Normal heart size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours have
 been stable.  Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is similar.  Bilateral
 hilar prominence and mild mediastinal widening from known mediastinal and
 hilar lymphadenopathy are better evaluated on prior chest CTs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Since ___, moderate left pleural effusion which is
 partially loculated and left basilar consolidation is unchanged, right
 infrahilar consolidation and presumed small right pleural effusions have
 worsened.
