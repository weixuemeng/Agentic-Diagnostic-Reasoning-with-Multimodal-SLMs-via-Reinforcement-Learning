                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o F with history of hypothyroidism presenting as pedestrian
 struck by car with SAH/SDH s/p intubation for altered mental status.  //
 interval change for patient with ETT.     interval change for patient with
 ETT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 monitoring and support devices.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits
 of normal.  Opacification bilaterally most likely reflects layering pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right. 
 Retrocardiac opacification silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Probable mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
