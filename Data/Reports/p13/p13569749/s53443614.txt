                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Opacity projecting over the right mid lung is again noted likely
 representative of the scarring versus atelectasis.  Chronic left upper lobe
 volume loss is again noted. The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes appear stable with atherosclerotic calcifications at
 the aortic arch.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones
 appear diffusely osteopenic but there is no evidence of an acute fracture.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
