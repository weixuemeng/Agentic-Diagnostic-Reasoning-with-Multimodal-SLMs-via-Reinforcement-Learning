                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ET placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ at 1:18 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 Since the prior radiograph, the patient has been intubated.  The ET tube
 terminates 4.9 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates within the
 stomach.  Widespread pulmonary opacities have worsened since 1:18 a.m.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The
 cardiac silhouette is obscured by the overlying opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1)  ET tube terminating 4.9 cm above the carina.
 2)  Orogastric tube within the stomach.
 3)  Worsening widespread pulmonary opacities, could reflect multifocal
 pneumonia and/or superimposed edema or ARDS.
