                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 minimal right apical pneumothorax.  Pigtail catheter remains in place.  Some
 areas of increased opacification was seen in the right mid and lower zones,
 consistent most likely with atelectasis.
