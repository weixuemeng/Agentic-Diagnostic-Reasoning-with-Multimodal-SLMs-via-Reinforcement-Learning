                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with known right lower lobe mass which
 recently was biopsied via bronchoscopy, followed by pneumothorax.  Now status
 post pigtail catheter placement.  Presents with right lower lobe pneumonia. 
 Evaluate for interval changes, worsening edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  The portable AP single
 image of the chest covers well the lung bases but does not include the
 ultimate tip of the apices.  Comparison with the next previous chest
 examination does not demonstrate any significant interval change.  As before,
 there is evidence of bilateral central pulmonary edema, but the pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested and no evidence of pleural effusion is present in
 the lateral pleural sinuses.  Although the apical area is not covered
 completely, there is no suggestion of any new apical pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.
