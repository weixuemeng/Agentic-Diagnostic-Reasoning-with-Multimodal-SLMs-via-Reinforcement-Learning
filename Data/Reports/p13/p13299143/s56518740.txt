                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest
 radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post wedge resection in the right lower lobe
 with associated architectural distortion and volume loss.  Lateral to the
 suture line is a poorly defined 1.6 cm diameter solid nodule.  Medial to this
 region are ground-glass opacities corresponding to a known complex
 ground-glass nodule on prior chest CT of ___.  Multiple
 additional solid and ground-glass nodules are seen to greater detail on the
 prior CT examination but several of these are evident by faint opacities on
 the current radiograph as well as prior studies.  No new areas of lung
 consolidation are identified to suggest an acute infectious pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pleural and parenchymal
 scarring at the left lung base appears unchanged, and note is also made of
 previous left mastectomy procedure.  Apparent solid nodule in the left
 mid-to-lower lung region likely corresponds to a nipple shadow based upon
 review of prior CT scan and prior chest radiographs.  No acute skeletal
 abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar radiographic appearance of multiple bilateral lung nodules, concerning
 for multifocal lung malignancy.  No acute superimposed areas of consolidation
 to suggest an acute infectious pneumonia, but subtle infectious foci may be
 difficult to detect in the setting of baseline nodules and postoperative
 changes.
