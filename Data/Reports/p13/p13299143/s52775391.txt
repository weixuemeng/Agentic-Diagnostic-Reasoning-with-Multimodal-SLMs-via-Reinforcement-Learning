                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with cough and fever and known adenocarcinoma and
 new squamCA of lung.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There are lower lung volumes;
 otherwise, multifocal bilateral lung opacities, larger in the right perihilar
 region, are grossly unchanged except for minimally increased opacities in the
 left retrocardiac region.  This increase in opacities could be due to
 increasing atelectasis or pneumonia.  The opacities in the right perihilar
 region have increased from ___.  These opacities are a superimposed
 infection or aspiration on top of the pre-existent lung abnormalities.  Right
 apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized.
