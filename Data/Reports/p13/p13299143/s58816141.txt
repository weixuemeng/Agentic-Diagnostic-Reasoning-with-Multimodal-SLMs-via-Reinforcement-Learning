                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute onset of cough and hypoxia, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase
 in size of the cardiac silhouette.  There also is a slight increase in extent
 of the pre-existing bilateral perihilar and lower lobe predominant parenchymal
 opacities.  No opacities have newly occurred.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic sinus, so that a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
