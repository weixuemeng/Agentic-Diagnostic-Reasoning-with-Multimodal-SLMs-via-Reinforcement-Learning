                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with pneumonia and question of ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 A right internal jugular venous central catheter terminates at the low SVC or
 at the cavoatrial junction.  An endotracheal tube is now positioned 2.5 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube is looped within the stomach. 
 Widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged since the ___ examination, with unchanged relative sparing of the left apex.  The heart
 size is top normal and unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1)  ET tube terminating 2.4 cm above the carina.
 2)  Unchanged appearance of widespread pulmonary opacities, with relative
 sparing of the left apex, compatible with widespread pneumonia and/or ARDS in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
