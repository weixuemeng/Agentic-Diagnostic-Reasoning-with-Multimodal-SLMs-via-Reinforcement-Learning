                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress post-intubation, evaluate for ET tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single supine portable chest view was reviewed in comparison
 with multiple prior radiographs from ___, with the most recent from
 ___.  Concurrently, a chest CT from ___ was reviewed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.2 cm above the carina and is
 appropriate. An orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the
 stomach with the tip in the fundus.  Right internal jugular line ends at lower
 SVC or cavoatrial junction. 
 
 Over the last 24 hours, there has been increase in the bilateral, diffuse,
 opacities, in a patter similar to what was seen on prior radiographs from
 ___ and ___. On concurrent review of prior radiograph series and
 recent chest CT, this recent increase in opacities is likely pulmonary edema
 on the background of preexisting infection.  Presumed small bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged. Right lower lobe mass is better appreciated and
 evaluated on prior chest CT's
