                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with subjective fever and dry cough.  Evaluate
 for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with the exception of minimal linear
 atelectasis in the left lung base.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  In the
 lateral view, there is a nodular focus of 1.8 cm projecting over the
 posteroinferior angle of a mid thoracic vertebra and the superior segments of
 the lower lobes. This lesion appears to follow the contour of the vertebral
 body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small hyperdense focus only seen in the lateral view as described
 above might represent an ill-defined sclerotic bony lesion versus a lung
 consolidation.  A chest CT is recommended for further assessment.
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr ___ ___ PCP at ___
 ___) via telephone on ___ at 10:30 am by Dr ___.
