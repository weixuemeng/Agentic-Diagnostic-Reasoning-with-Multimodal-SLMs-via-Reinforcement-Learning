                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There has been markedly improving aeration of the left lung.  Small left
 effusion has improved.  Rounded opacity in the left mid lung could be fluid in
 the fissure and/or atelectasis.  Widened mediastinum has improved.  Right
 lower lobe opacities have increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis. 
 Small right effusion is unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard
 position.  Mild vascular congestion is stable.
