                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG for assessment
 of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Post-sternotomy wires are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 and bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Subcutaneous air is new in the
 left upper chest wall, but no clear pneumothorax is seen, attention to this
 area on the subsequent studies is required.  Note is made of the lucency along
 the left mediastinal border that might reflect pneumothorax.
