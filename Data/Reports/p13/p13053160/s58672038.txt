                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Re-positioning of the PICC line.
 
 Currently, the AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates the right PICC line tip
 being at the level of mid SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable. 
 Minimal bibasal opacities are demonstrated most likely reflecting atelectasis
 but attention to this area to exclude the possibility of developing infection
 is recommended.
