                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Unchanged course and position of the left PICC line.  A pre-existing
 minimal atelectasis at the lung bases has completely resolved.  The lung
 volumes, however, remain low, there is no evidence of pleural effusions or
 focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
