                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with falls, ams  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Overall, the lungs are
 otherwise hyperinflated. On the lateral view, there may be subtle increase in
 density in the posterior lung base which may be due to overlying structures
 although a consolidation is not excluded. Left basilar linear opacities
 suggest atelectasis/ scarring. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. There may be subtle
 callus formation at the lateral left seventh and ninth ribs which could be due
 to underlying subacute fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Questionable opacity projecting over the
 posterior lower lung on the lateral view, not well substantiated on the
 frontal view, which may project over the left lung base, consolidation not
 excluded.
 
 Subtle callus formation at the lateral left seventh and ninth ribs which could
 be due to underlying subacute fractures ; not optimally evaluated on this
 study. Correlate with patient history for acuity and consider additional
 imaging as clinically warranted.
