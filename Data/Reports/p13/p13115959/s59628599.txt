  1. Dobhoff tube terminating in the upper to mid esophagus, this should be

  2. Mildly increased bibasilar interstitial markings may reflect mild volume
  overload.
  3. Right upper opacities may represent pulmonary nodules, chest CT could be
  obtained for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dobhoff, evaluate Dobhoff positioning.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The Dobhoff tube terminates in the mid to proximal esophagus.  This should be
 advanced for optimal placement within the stomach.  Faint irregular opacities
 in the right upper lung may represent pulmonary nodules.  Chest CT could be
 obtained for further evaluation if clinically indicated.  Mildly increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally may reflect mild volume overload.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The osseous structures and upper
 abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Dobhoff tube terminating in the upper to mid esophagus, this should be
 advanced for optimal placement.
 2. Mildly increased bibasilar interstitial markings may reflect mild volume
 overload.
 3. Right upper opacities may represent pulmonary nodules, chest CT could be
