 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest

 stomach.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Lungs are
 hyperinflated with findings suggestive of emphysema.  Streaky left basilar
 opacity may reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are mild degenerative changes within the thoracic spine with S-shaped
 scoliosis.
