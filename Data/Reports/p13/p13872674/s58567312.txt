                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Desaturation after fluids.  Assess for acute abdominal process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube terminates at the level of the GE junction as on
 the recent prior.  Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Diffuse pulmonary
 opacities as well as thickened septal lines and vascular congestion reflect
 mild pulmonary edema.  Cardiac size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Nasogastric tube terminates at the level of the GE junction as mentioned
 on the previous study. Could be advanced by 10 cm for optimal positioning.
