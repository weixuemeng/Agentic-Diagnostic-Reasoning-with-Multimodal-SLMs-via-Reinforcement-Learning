                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Emphysema, lightheadedness, assess for acute abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms and coarsened reticular markings
 compatible with emphysema/COPD.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is prominence of the pulmonary hila, right
 greater than left, likely reflective of pulmonary hypertension. Heart size is
 top normal.  Bony structures appear intact with dextroscoliosis of the
 T-spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with prominence of central pulmonary arteries,
 likely indicates pulmonary arterial hypertension given the underlying
 emphysema.  Please correlate clinically.  No evidence of pneumonia.
