                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough and hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs and
 flattening of hemidiaphragms, compatible with underlying emphysema.  There are
 prominent interstitial markings.  Superimposed, there are airspace opacities
 in the right upper and bilateral lower lung zones, which appear new since
 prior exam.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Again noted are prominent pulmonary
 arteries, which may reflect underlying pulmonary hypertension.  Heart size is
 top normal.  Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominent interstitial markings suggestive of interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Subtle bilateral airspace opacities are new since prior and may
 reflect superimposed infection.
 
 2.  Hyperextended lungs with flattened hemidiaphragms, compatible with known
 underlying emphysema.
 
 3.  Prominent pulmonary arteries may reflect underlying pulmonary
 hypertension.
