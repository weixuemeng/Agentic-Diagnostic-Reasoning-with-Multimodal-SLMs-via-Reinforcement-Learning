 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Coarse lung sounds.  Smoker with productive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Consolidation in the right lung is probably in the upper lobe and superior
 segment of the lower lobe.  It has improved slightly since ___.  This
 is probably pneumonia and may be related to bronchial obstruction from the
 large central lymph node mass, metastatic spread from a cavitating right lower
 lobe lung lesion, presumably bronchogenic carcinoma.  Small left pleural
 effusion is new.  Heart size is normal.
