  The rounded contour of the right lower lobe mass is not clearly identifed,
  consistent with debridement. Right lower lobe opacity is again noted and
  appears slightly more prominent. These findings are likely representative of
  superimposition of shadows from previously visualized opacity in the right
  lower lobe from pneumonia with new post-operative changes of
  atelectasis/edema. Left sided drain and right IJ in place. No pneumothorax.
  Continued followup is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right lower lobe tumor, status post bronchoscopic debridement,
 evaluate for right lower lobe aeration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared with most recent prior radiograph, the right lower lobe
 mass is no longer clearly seen, consistent with debridement.  Increased
 opacification in the right lower lobe is likely due to hemorrhage.  The right
 mid lung opacification has improved compared to prior.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Normal heart size and mediastinal contours.
