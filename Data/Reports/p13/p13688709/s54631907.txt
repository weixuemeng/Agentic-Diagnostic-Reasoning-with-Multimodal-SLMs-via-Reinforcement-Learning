                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to prior PET-CT from ___ as well as chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been significant interval increase in right mid-to-lower
 lung opacity which may represent combination of worsening malignancy and
 underlying atelectasis/pleural fluid, although underlying infection may also
 be present.  There are areas of lucency that project over the right lower lung
 opacity which may represent aerated lung, although cavitation is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is also left lower lobe opacity,
 to a lesser extent, which could also represent additional site of infection,
 malignancy, aspiration.  No evidence of left pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significant interval increase in right-sided pulmonary opacity. 
 Differential diagnosis includes worsening of malignant process, with possible
 underlying right pleural effusion, and/or underlying infectious process. 
 There are areas of lucency projecting over the opacity which may relate to
 aerated lung although underlying cavitation is not excluded.
 2.  Left lower lobe opacity to a lesser extent than the right.  Differential
 diagnosis include infection, aspiration, disease spread.
