                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with adjusted NGT from ___ to 55 cm  //
 Placement NGT after adjustment to 55cm
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 13:00, the NG tube tip and side-port now overlie
 the gastric fundus.
 
   Again seen is a right-sided PICC line with tip overlying the right atrium. 
 It may have been retracted compared with the most recent prior film, but
 continues to overlie the right atrium.  Retraction by 3 cm could help for
 positioning in the distal SVC.
 
 Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
