                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with weakness, low grade temp  // ? pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent, but unchanged.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac density and
 obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Equivocal small effusion.  There is patchy
 opacity at the right base, similar to the prior film.  No gross right
 effusion.  Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, minimally
 improved.
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight improvement in CHF findings.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior.  The
 possibility of a left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 3. Patchy opacity right cardiophrenic region, similar to prior.  This most
 likely represents atelectasis, but the possibility of an early infiltrate
 cannot be entirely excluded.
