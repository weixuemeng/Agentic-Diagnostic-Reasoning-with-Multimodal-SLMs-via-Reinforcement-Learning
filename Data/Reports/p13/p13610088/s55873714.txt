                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with sepsis and worsening shortness of breath after
 volume resuscitation.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, exaggerating pulmonary vascular markings.  There is
 minimal interstitial abnormality.  A new left pleural effusion is seen.  New
 retrocardiac density and right basilar consolidation most likely represent
 atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is detected. 
 Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to low lung volumes and portable
 technique.  Aortic calcification is seen.  Air is noted in the esophagus. 
 Indentation of the right tracheal contour at the level of the thyroid gland
 raises the possibility of right thyroid enlargement or nodule. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New left pleural effusion.  
 
 2. New bibasilar consolidations, which most likely represent atelectasis, but
 aspiration cannot be excluded.  Close follow-up is recommended. 
 
 3. Possible right thyroid nodule or enlargement.  Given patient's reported
 history of partial thyroidectomy, correlation with prior thyroid imaging and
 non-urgent follow-up is recommended if clinically warranted. 
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by
 ___ by phone at 3:28 p.m. on ___ after attending radiologist
 review.
