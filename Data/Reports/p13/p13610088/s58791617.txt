                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size.  Previously
 reported pulmonary interstitial edema has resolved.  Improved aeration in the
 left lower lobe with residual patchy opacity remaining which is likely
 atelectasis.  Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of interstitial edema.
 2.  Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
 3.  Rapidly resolving left lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis, but
 improving pneumonia is also possible if the patient has been receiving
 interval antibiotic therapy.
