                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with coronary artery disease,
 biventricular pacer with ICD device implanted on ___.  Left ventricular
 threshold increased?  Left ventricular lead dislodged.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Permanent pacer capsule
 in unchanged position in anterior left axillary region.  Unchanged appearance
 of connecting intracavitary electrodes.  The ICD device terminates in
 unchanged fashion in the right ventricular apical area and the left
 ventricular stimulating electrode passes again from the right atrium in the
 venous coronary sinus to terminate in the mid portion of obtuse marginal
 coronary vein.  The positions of the wires remain completely unchanged in
 comparison with the previous study of ___.  As before, the patient was
 unable to elevate left arm for the lateral view but image qualities are very
 acceptable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged position of previously identified ICD device, in
 particular unchanged position of left ventricular electrode terminating in
