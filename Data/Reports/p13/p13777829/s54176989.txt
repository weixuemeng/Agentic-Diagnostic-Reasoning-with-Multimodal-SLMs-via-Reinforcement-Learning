 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT chest with contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:

 opacities have improved, however the right middle lobe opacity has worsened. 
 There is a 9 mm radiodensity projecting over the right lower lung, which
 represents a calcified granuloma, and was visualized on the prior chest CT. 
 Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
