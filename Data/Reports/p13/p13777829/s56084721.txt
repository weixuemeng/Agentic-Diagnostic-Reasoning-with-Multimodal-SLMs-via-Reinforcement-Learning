 HLD, TIA, hx of multiple recent right sided pleural effusion that required
 drainage, presenting with recurrent effusion and SOB, now s/p talc
 pleurodesis.  // Is there any interval change in pleural effusion? PLEASE TAKE

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.  Right chest tube remains in place and
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is slightly less prominent, which could reflect either decrease in
 pleural effusion or a more erect position of the patient.
 There is increasing gas in the dilated fundus of the stomach, for which a
 nasogastric tube could be helpful.
