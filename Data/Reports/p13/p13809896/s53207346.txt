 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip projects 4 cm above the carina.  Tip of the
 nasogastric tube ends below the diaphragm, there is no evidence of
 complications, notably no pneumothorax.  A heterogeneous opacity at the right
 lung base might result from aspiration or reflect early pneumonia.  A wet read
 was delivered.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal fluid
 overload.
