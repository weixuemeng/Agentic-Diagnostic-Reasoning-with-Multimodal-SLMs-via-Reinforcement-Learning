 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:31 PM
  Portable upright chest radiograph is compared to prior study dated ___.  There remains bilateral pleural effusions which relative to prior
  examination on the left appears decreased.  Several clips project over the
  left upper lobe.  A left PICC terminates in the mid superior vena cava. 
  Perihilar bilateral opacities are not significantly change relative to prior
  examination.  Retro cardiac consolidation is present for which infectious
  process is difficult to exclude.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increasing O2 requirement  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly smaller on
 the left.  Left lower lobe atelectasis is also unchanged.  A left-sided PICC
 terminates in the mid SVC.  Prominence of the bilateral hila likely reflect
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Surgical clips project over the left hemi
 thorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion, otherwise no
