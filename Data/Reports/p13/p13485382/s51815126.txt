                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is no focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a
 trace pleural effusion. The cardiac and hilar contours are normal. The aorta
 is tortuous and calcified. No pulmonary edema is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace left pleural effusion. No radiographic evidence for
 pneumonia.
