                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post extubation interval study.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  Rotated positioning.  NG type tube is
 present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film.  A right subclavian central line is
 present, tip over distal SVC.  Upper zone redistribution and pulmonary
 vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.  Again seen is increased retrocardiac
 density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  There
 is minimal atelectasis at the right base.  Small bilateral effusions cannot be
 excluded.  Incidental note is made of soft tissue anchors in the right humeral
 head and fusion hardware in the lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and CHF with
 possible small bilateral effusions, similar to ___ at 3:56 a.m.
