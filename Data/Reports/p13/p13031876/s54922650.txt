                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Aspiration event requiring intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, an endotracheal tube has been placed.  Its
 tip is 5.3 cm from the carina.  A PICC ends in the mid SVC.  A feeding tube
 overlies the stomach with the tip out of view.  A pleural effusion on the left
 is small.  A persistent consolidation at the left base is unchanged and likely
 reflects chronic atelectasis.  There are no new opacities.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cervical hardware and right humeral soft tissue anchors are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube 5.3 cm from the carina.
 2.  Persistent left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
