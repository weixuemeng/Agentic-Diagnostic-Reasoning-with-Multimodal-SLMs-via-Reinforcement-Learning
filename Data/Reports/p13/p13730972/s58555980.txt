                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with pericard and pleural effusion ,pls eval for inc pleur
 effus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day, ___, and chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to exam from earlier the same day, there has been no significant
 interval change. Dense left basilar opacity is noted compatible with moderate
 pleural effusion with possible underlying consolidation. Minimal blunting of
 the right posterior costophrenic angle may be a small effusion. Given
 silhouetting of the left cardiac silhouette, cardiac size is difficult to
 assess but is likely enlarged. No acute osseous abnormalities
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacity likely in part due to moderate pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis, infection is possible. Possible trace right pleural
 effusion.
