                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, rule out pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung volumes
 limit evaluation.  There is bronchovascular crowding, likely accounting for
 the slightly increased opacities in the lower lungs on the lateral view.  No
 definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 definite displaced rib fractures are seen.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
