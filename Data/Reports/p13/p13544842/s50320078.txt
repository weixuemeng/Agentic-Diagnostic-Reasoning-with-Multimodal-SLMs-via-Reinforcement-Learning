                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DM, PD and CKD p/w AMS now with new O2
 requirement  // evaluate for infiltrate/effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  Patchy and linear left basilar opacities have slightly worsened and
 are likely due to atelectasis although superimposed aspiration or developing
 infection are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small left
 pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size.  No other relevant
 changes.
