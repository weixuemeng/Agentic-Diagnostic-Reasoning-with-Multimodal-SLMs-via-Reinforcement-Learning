                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilsteral rib pain. ? occult fracture  //
 ? fracture. bilateral rib pain and tenderness
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple healed right rib fractures are present.  No definite acute rib
 fractures are evident on this chest radiograph which was not specifically
 tailored to assess the ribs. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits, and lungs are grossly
 clear. Abandoned pacemaker lead remains in place, terminating in the right
 ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multiple healed right rib fractures. No definite acute rib fractures detected,
 but diffuse osseous demineralization and lack of dedicated rib radiographs
 limit sensitivity for detecting acute fractures. If symptoms are localized 3
 specific region, coned-down rib radiograph could be obtained with a marker if
 warranted clinically.
