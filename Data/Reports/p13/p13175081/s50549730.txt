                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with past medical history of Marfan's syndrome and
 bronchiectasis with a productive cough and fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Sternal wires denote prior median sternotomy, and mitral valve replacement. 
 Lateral view suggests there may be new calcifications in the aortic valve,
 which I am at a loss to explain.  Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Pleural
 surfaces, hilar, and mediastinal contours are normal.
