                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube, esophageal stent and PICC remain in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Widespread airspace opacities
 affecting the right lung to greater degree than the left are again
 demonstrated, and are concerning for widespread infection.  Known abscess in
 right lower lobe is seen to better detail on recent CT.  Pigtail pleural
 catheter is present in the lower right hemithorax, presumably within the
 abscess.  Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
