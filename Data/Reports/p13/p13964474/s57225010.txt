 The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.  The esophageal stent is in place,
 unchanged since the prior study.  The right internal jugular line tip is at
 the level of superior SVC.  There is redemonstration of pneumoperitoneum, at
 least mild-to-moderate, grossly unchanged since the prior study.  Extensive
 parenchymal consolidations are unchanged as well, predominantly involving the
 right mid and lower lung and then the left mid lobe.
