                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates confluent opacity in the
 right mid and lower lung.  There is relative sparing of the right apex. 
 Rounded lucencies projecting over right hemithorax, are suggestive of cavities
 or abscess formation.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is likely. 
 Ground-glass opacities most pronounced in the left mid lung zone.  There is no
 large left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is difficult
 to discern due to adjacent opacities.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Confluent opacity involving mid and lower right lung with round
 lucencies, suggestive of cavitation and/or abscess formation.  Ground-glass
 opacification of the left mid lung.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
 Findings concerning for infection with cavitary lesions in the right lower
 lung.  Correlation with CT exam from the outside hospital, which by report was
 performed at the OSH.
