                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Melanoma, to assess for disease status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for much of the prominence of
 the transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of pulmonary or skeletal
 metastasis.
