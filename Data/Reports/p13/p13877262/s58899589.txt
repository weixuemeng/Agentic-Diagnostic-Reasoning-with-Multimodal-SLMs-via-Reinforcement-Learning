                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post right subclavian attempt (aborted),
 status post left internal jugular central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 04:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.
 No pneumothorax is identified. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures remains. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are
 slightly worse in the interval and may reflect worsening atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung
 volumes.
