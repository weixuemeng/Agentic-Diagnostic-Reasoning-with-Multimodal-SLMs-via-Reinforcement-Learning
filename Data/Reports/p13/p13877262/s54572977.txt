 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:05 AM
  There is persistent opacification of the majority of the right lung, likely by
  a large pleural effusion.  There is a new new Swan-Ganz catheter in
  appropriate position. Intra-aortic balloon pump is less than 1 cm from the
  apex of the aortic arch and should be slightly retracted.  Small left pleural
  effusion is new.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute heart failure s/p RHC and IABP
 placement // eval position of lines, interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increased near complete opacification of the right hemithorax without
 new shift of the mediastinum.  There is no pneumothorax. A Swan-Ganz catheter
 projects over the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Increased interstitial
 opacities in the left lung are most likely due to pulmonary edema.  A stable
 retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis. The
 intra-aortic balloon pump tip is within 1 cm of the upper aspect of the aortic
 arch.  A new layering left pleural effusion is small.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased near complete opacification of the right hemithorax is most likely
 due to a combination of atelectasis and large pleural effusion.
 New mild pulmonary edema.
 New small left pleural effusion with increased partial left lower lobe
 collapse.
 High-riding IABP should be retracted by 2 cm for more optimal positioning.
