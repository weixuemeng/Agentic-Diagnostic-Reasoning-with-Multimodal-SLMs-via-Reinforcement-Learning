                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF exacerbation and IABP.  // evaluate for
 interval improvement in pulm edema/effusion.  Evaluate for IABP placement
 (pulled back per last CXR)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and Tubes: Intra-aortic balloon pump terminates 2 cm from the apex of
 the aortic arch.  Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in location.  EKG leads
 overlie the chest wall.
 
 Lungs: Persistent opacification of the right hemi thorax sparing a portion of
 the right upper and mid zones.  Left lung is clear.
 
 Pleura: There is a persistent large right-sided pleural effusion with
 mediastinal shift to the left side.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Mediastinum: Mediastinum appears shifted to the left side secondary to the
 large right pleural effusion.
 
 Bony thorax: Unchanged compared to the prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Intra-aortic balloon pump terminates 2 cm from the apex of the aortic arch.
 Persistent large right pleural effusion and, likely underlying atelectasis. 
 Mediastinum remains shifted to the left side.
