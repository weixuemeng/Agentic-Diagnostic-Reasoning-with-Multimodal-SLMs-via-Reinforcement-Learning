                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with desaturations on room
 air.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Bibasal consolidations and particular in the right lung base appear to be
 slightly progressed since the prior study associated with bilateral pleural
 effusions.  At least, partial collapse of the right lower lobe and partial
 left lower lobe atelectasis are present.  There is no evidence of appreciable
 pneumothorax.
