                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M intubated  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube tip is 5.1 cm from the carina. Enteric tube seen with tip below
 the diaphragm although side port is likely proximal to the GE junction. Dense
 opacity seen at the right lung apex with less conspicuous left apical opacity
 aswell. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Additional
 retrocardiac opacity may represent additional region of parenchymal
 consolidation, potentially a similar process are atelectasis PA. Elsewhere,
 the lungs are clear. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged likely accentuated
 by portable technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 arch. Bilateral rib fractures are noted, some of which appear old although
 some along the left chest wall are age indeterminate.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube side port likely proximal to the GE junction and should be
 advanced for optimal positioning.
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities, most conspicuous at the right lung apex
 suspicious for multifocal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural effusions.
