                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hip fracture, preop.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated somewhat flattening the diaphragms, consistent with chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is slight blunting of the bilateral
 posterior costophrenic angles which likely relates to hyperinflation, although
 very trace pleural effusion is not entirely excluded.  There is mild left base
 atelectasis/scarring.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left base atelectasis/scarring.
 2.  COPD.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may relate to
 hyperinflation, although trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.
