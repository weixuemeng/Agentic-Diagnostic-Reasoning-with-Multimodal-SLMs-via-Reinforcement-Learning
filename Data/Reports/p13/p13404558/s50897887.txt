                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intracranial hemorrhage, question acute process in the
 chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Low lung
 volumes limit evaluation.  Probable bronchovascular crowding accounts for
 opacity at the right medial lung base.  No definite signs of pneumonia,
 aspiration, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study given the low lung volumes, without acute
 intrathoracic process.
