 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Epigastric pain and EKG changes.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is slight subpleural scarring at each lung
 apex.  Otherwise, lung fields appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear within normal limits.  There are a
 number of small air-fluid levels projecting over the left upper quadrant
 including within the stomach, but no evidence for free air or bowel dilatation
 on limited visualization of the epigastric region.  Surgical clips project
 over the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Non-specific air-fluid levels seen within bowel in the left upper
 quadrant.
