                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pleural effusion.  New right upper lobe mass status post CT
 and PleurX placement, question recurrent effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11 a.m.
 
 Compared with one day earlier, no gross change is identified.  Again seen are
 two right-sided chest tubes.  No distinct pneumothorax is detected, but faint
 curvilinear densities at the right lung apex could reflect a small indistinct
 pneumothorax.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  There
 is trace fluid at the right costophrenic sulcus without significant change
 compared with the earlier film.  Again seen is the large mass at the right
 lung apex.  There is slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle and atelectasis at the left lung base, similar
 to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Equivocal minimal right apical pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no
 significant change compared with one day earlier.
