                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study ___.
 
 Small right pleural effusion has increased in size.  Right chest tube is in
 place.  Cardiac size is normal.  The appearance of the cardiomediastinum and
 right perihilar upper opacity is grossly unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Opacity in the right upper lobe is consistent with patient's known right upper
 lobe suprahilar mass, better seen in prior CT.
