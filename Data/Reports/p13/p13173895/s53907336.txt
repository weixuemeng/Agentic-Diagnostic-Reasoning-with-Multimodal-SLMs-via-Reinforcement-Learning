 removal yesterday, now O2 sat ___% and fever.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is
 cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration and splaying of the carina
 suggestive of left atrial enlargement.  There is upper zone redistribution,
 but no overt CHF.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm, unchanged.  Increased opacity seen projecting over the left
 lower lobe is unchanged.  Possible minimal blunting of both costophrenic
 angles posteriorly, also probably unchanged.  Catheter noted over right upper
 quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant change compared with ___.  Upper zone
 redistribution as well as some patchy opacity in the left base.  Of note, this
 opacity is new compared with an outside film from ___ dated
