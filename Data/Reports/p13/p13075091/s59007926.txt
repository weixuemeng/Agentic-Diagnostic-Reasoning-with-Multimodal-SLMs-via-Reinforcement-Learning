 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided demonstrating clear
 well-expanded lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A
 focal eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen.  Tiny surgical
 clips in the superior mediastinum likely reflect prior thyroid surgery. 
 Mediastinal contour is otherwise normal.  Bony structures are intact.
