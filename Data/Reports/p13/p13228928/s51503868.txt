                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison with multiple prior radiographs of the chest ranging in date from
 ___ through ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pre-op, patient with hip dislocation.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The
 patient is known to have an elevated left hemidiaphragm with focal
 eventration.  Lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The retrocardiac space is poorly assessed given the elevated
 left hemidiaphragm, though the possibility of a hiatal hernia is not excluded.
 The heart size cannot be assessed, though appears grossly stable.  The
 mediastinal contour appears stable.  No acute bony abnormality is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable elevated left hemidiaphragm.  No acute findings.
