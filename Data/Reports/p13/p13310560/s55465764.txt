                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SOB.  // r/o consolidation vs congestion/
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, the overall appearance is similar, with
 continued opacity at the right lung base, likely combination of collapse
 and/or consolidation and a small pleural effusion.  This may be very slightly
 improved compared to the prior film.
 
 Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD.  There is borderline upper zone
 redistribution but no overt CHF.  No left-sided effusion.
 
 No new focal infiltrate is identified.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including cardiomegaly, is unchanged
 allowing for technical differences.  Sternotomy wires and left-sided pacemaker
 with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued right base opacity, slightly improved compared with ___. 
 This likely represents a combination of collapse and consolidation and a small
 pleural effusion.
 
 No new infiltrate detected and no left-sided effusion.
 
 Borderline upper zone redistribution.  No overt CHF.
