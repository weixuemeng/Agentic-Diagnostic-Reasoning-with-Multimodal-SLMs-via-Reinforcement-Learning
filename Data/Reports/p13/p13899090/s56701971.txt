                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___:
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia, assess for fluid overload
 or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Mild streaky
 bronchovascular lower lung opacities could represent crowding of
 bronchovasculature, though an atypical infection is difficult to exclude.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  No frank signs of congestive heart failure. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures appear intact.  
 Mild bilateral AC joint arthropathy is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral streaky lower lobe opacities which could, in the right
 clinical setting, represent an atypical pneumonia.
