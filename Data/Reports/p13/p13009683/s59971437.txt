                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post VATS wedge resection.  Evaluate postoperatively.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, new right-sided chest tube is present with the
 tip in the medial mid lung zone.  Some subcutaneous air is noted in the right
 chest wall.  The lung volumes are lower with patchy interstitial opacities,
 likely from mild edema.  A more focal opacity in the left mid lung zone is
 present.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  The heart size is mildly enlarged and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Focal right mid lung zone opacity, which is nonspecific, and may be focal
 atelectasis, though a small amount of hemorrhage or a developing infection is
 a consideration.  
 3.  Satisfactory position of the chest tubes.  No pneumothorax.
