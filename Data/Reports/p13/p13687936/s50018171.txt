                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worsening SOB and tachpynea, s/p IV lasix 
 // interval improvement w/ diuresis? or more representative of brewing ARDS?
 thanks!
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 00:46
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been no substantial change in widespread
 parenchymal opacities with slightly more uniform distribution of similar
 severity, does pulmonary edema versus ARDS would be the most likely diagnosis.
 Parenchymal hemorrhage or pneumonia are substantially less likely.  Since no
 substantial response after diuresis is demonstrated, continuous surveillance
 with chest radiographs is indicated.  No cardiomediastinal change demonstrated
