                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with t cell lymphoma, high dose steroids and
 chemo, counts dropping, crackles at bilateral bases  // r/o PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously malpositioned right
 PICC line is now well positioned. The tip of the line projects over the
 cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes persists. Areas of atelectasis at both
 the left and the right lung basis are visible. The symmetry of these changes,
 however, suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 larger pleural effusions.
