                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob, hypoxia  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and PA and lateral chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities most likely representing
 multifocal pneumonia. This is less likely to be florid pulmonary edema due to
 lack of concomitant pleural effusions or cardiomegaly. Underlying metastatic
 disease cannot be excluded. There is widening of the superior aspect of the
 mediastinum. The heart is normal in size. A left lateral lower rib appears
 expanded and sclerotic likely due to metastases better evaluated on prior bone
 scans.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, likely pneumonia.
 2. Widening of the superior aspect of the mediastinum i s present and can be
 further evaluated with chest CT if indicated.
 3.  Expansion and increased density of a left lateral rib due to known bony
 metastatic disease.
