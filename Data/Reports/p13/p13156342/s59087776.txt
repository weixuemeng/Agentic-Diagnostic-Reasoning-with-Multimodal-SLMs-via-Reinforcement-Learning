                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with one-week history of nonproductive cough,
 now with fever.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hypoinflated.  There are bilateral increased vascular
 markings as well as interstitial opacities, more pronounced in the lower
 lobes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bronchovascular markings, more pronounced in the lower
 lobes might represent crowding due to low lung volumes, although pneumonia is
 diffcicult to exclude.
