                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung nodule s/p RUL wedge resection.  //
 concern for interval PTX s/p thoracic ___ removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the right-sided chest tube.  There is
 volume loss in the right lung consistent with the wedge resection.  There is a
 pleural-based opacity along the right lateral chest wall, likely a hematoma or
 loculated effusion related to the chest strain removal from this area.  There
 is a small amount of subcutaneous air also presumed to be related to the
 recent chest drain removal.  No pneumothorax seen.  The left lung is clear. 
 Evaluation of the bony structures is limited likely due to the scoliotic curve
 at the thoracolumbar junction.
