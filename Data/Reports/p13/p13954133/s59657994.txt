                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX. Pigtail placement. Clamped at 10 am 
 // Interval change. Please complete at 1 pm
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day at 08:55, the right pigtail catheter is
 similar in configuration.  Again seen is a small right apical pneumothorax
 smaller than on ___ at 08:38, though more apparent than on the
 film obtained earlier the same day.
 
 The patchy opacity in the right mid/lower zone is grossly unchanged and may
 lie within the right middle lobe.  While this probably represents right middle
 lobe atelectasis, an area of aspiration pneumonitis or early infectious
 infiltrate could have a similar appearance.
 
 Minimal subsegmental atelectasis left base is similar to prior.  Known
 metastatic pulmonary nodules again noted.  No CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pigtail catheter unchanged in position.  A small right apical pneumothorax
 remains present.
 
 Patchy opacity in right mid/lower zone, similar to earlier the same day,
 allowing for technical differences --___ atelectasis versus early
 pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
