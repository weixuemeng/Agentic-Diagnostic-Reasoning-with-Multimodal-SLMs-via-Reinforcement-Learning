                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PTX. Pigtail placement  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the most recent prior study, the previously seen right upper
 zone pneumothorax has decreased considerably.  Doubt but cannot entirely
 exclude a tiny residual apical pneumothorax.
 
 
 Again seen is the right-sided pigtail catheter -- on the current exam, it
 liesslightly higher and against the inner surface of the mid/lower right chest
 wall.  Previously seen atelectasis at the right lung base has improved, though
 there is new irregular opacity in the right mid zone.
 
 Left line remains grossly clear except for known pulmonary nodules.  No
 pleural effusion detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete versus complete resolution of the right apical pneumothorax.
 
 Resolution of previously seen right base atelectasis.
 
 New faint patchy opacity in the right mid/lower zone including area of chain
 sutures and pigtail catheter.  Suspect represent an area of early atelectasis,
 though an early infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis could
 have a similar appearance.
