                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New diagnosis of AML with acute onset of coughing and diffuse
 rhonchi on exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal and
 stable.  A right central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip
 projecting over the low SVC.  There is a vague retrocardiac density in the
 left lower lung.  Right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague retrocardiac opacity which may represent focal atelectasis,
 but  PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for further
 characterization if there is clinical suspicion for pneumonia.
