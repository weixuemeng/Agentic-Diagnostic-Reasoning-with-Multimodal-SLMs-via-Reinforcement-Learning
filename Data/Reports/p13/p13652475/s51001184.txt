                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New diagnosis of AML with increased sputum production and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  The
 previously noted subtle retrocardiac density has no clear lateral correlate
 and is likely vascular shadowing.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right central venous catheter is
 unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Previously appreciated retrocardiac density has no clear lateral
 correlate.  No clear evidence of pneumonia.
