                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:47
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 8:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian Port-A-Cath and right subclavian PICC are unchanged. 
 Interval reduction in lung volumes with patchy opacities at both bases most
 likely representing areas of atelectasis.  No crowding of the vasculature with
 no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient rotation between studies.
