                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fracture of the wrist, preoperative evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with slight unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal and the lungs are clear.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulcus
 on the right may suggest the presence of a trace right pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Blunted right posterior costophrenic angle likely indicative of a small
 pleural effusion.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
