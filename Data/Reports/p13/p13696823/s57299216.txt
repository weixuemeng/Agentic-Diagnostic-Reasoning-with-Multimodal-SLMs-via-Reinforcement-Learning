 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:57 AM
  New radiopacity in the anterior mediastinum, posterior to the xiphoid process
  of the sternum and projecting over the anterior cardiac margin is of unclear
  clinical significance and may be the result of difference in radiographic
  projection compared with ___. However given history of HIV further assessment
  with chest CT is recommended to exclude neoplastic process.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and history of HIV and probable
 tuberculosis.  Evaluate for acute pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiac size is normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is opacification overlying the lower
 portion of the cardiac silhouette anteriorly.  This could merely be a
 manifestation of a different obliquity from the study of ___ and
 merely represent normal fat.  If there is any clinical suspicion relative to
 this area, a repeat lateral view with the obliquity of the ___ study could be
 obtained.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Essentially within normal limits except for possible anterior opacification at
 the base on the lateral view.  If this is an area of clinical concern, a
 repeat lateral with the obliquity of the ___ study could be obtained.  If
 there is a substantial difference, a CT could be be warranted.
