  Ill-defined focal opacity in the left mid lung field.  This may reflect an
  area of infection, however followup radiographs are needed to ensure
  resolution of this finding after treatment as neoplasm cannot be excluded. 
  Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size mildly unchanged.  The aorta appears mildly tortuous but unchanged.
 The hila bilaterally appear prominent which may reflect enlarged pulmonary
 arteries.  Lungs are hyperinflated with suggestion of emphysematous changes in
 the apices.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  More focal
 ill-defined opacity is seen within the left mid lung field.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Ill-defined focal opacity in the left mid lung field.  This may reflect an
 area of infection, however followup radiographs are needed to ensure
 resolution of this finding after treatment as neoplasm cannot be excluded.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up radiographs are recommended after treatment to
 ensure resolution of this finding as an underlying neoplasm cannot be
 excluded.
