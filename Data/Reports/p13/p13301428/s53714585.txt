                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma with pulmonary contusion and rib fractures.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little change and no
 evidence of acute pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectatic changes at the left base
 where there are several rib fractures.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle could reflect a small amount of fluid in the pleural space.
