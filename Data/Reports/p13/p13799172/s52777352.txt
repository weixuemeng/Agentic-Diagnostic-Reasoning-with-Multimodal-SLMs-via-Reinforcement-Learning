                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is an eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, as before.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  There is mild
 anterior wedging of two lower thoracic vertebral bodies at which point
 kyphotic curvature is mildly exaggerated.  These deformities appear chronic
 with some increased loss in vertebral body heights and new anterior
 osteophytes since the remote prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.
