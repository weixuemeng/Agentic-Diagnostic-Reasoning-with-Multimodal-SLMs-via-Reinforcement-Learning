                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic dry cough  // r/o infiltrate/mass   
 DRY COUGH X 3 MONTHS;R/O INFILTRATES/MASS
 
 COMPARISON:  The only prior chest radiographs available were taken ___.
 
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Heart is borderline enlarged, increased
 since prior study but there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement and certainly
 no edema or pleural effusion to suggest cardiac decompensation. Pleural
 surfaces, hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 
 The symptom of chronic cough in the setting of a normal conventional chest
 radiograph could still be caused by small lesion in the tracheobronchial tree,
 structural abnormality such as tracheal bronchomalacia, or hypersensitivity
 pneumonia.  Depending upon other clinical findings, either routine chest CT or
 chest CT with dynamic tracheal imaging would speak to these possible
 diagnoses.
