                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.  Interval
 slight decrease in width of mediastinal vascular pedicle, accompanied by
 improvement in extent of pulmonary edema and reduction in size of right
 pleural effusion.  Left effusion has apparently resolved.  Prominent lucency
 adjacent to left heart border and diaphragm could potentially represent a
 basilar pneumothorax on this supine view.  Lateral decubitus radiograph may be
 helpful to exclude a left pneumothorax.
