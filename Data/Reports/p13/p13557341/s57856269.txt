                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 820 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with VF arrest, now with cooling protocol line and
 intubation.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 820 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Support and monitoring devices are in satisfactory position.  There is
 improving mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.  In addition, there is
 retrocardiac opacity with probable associated layering left effusion which
 likely reflects patchy atelectasis and is slightly worse when compared to the
 prior study.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
