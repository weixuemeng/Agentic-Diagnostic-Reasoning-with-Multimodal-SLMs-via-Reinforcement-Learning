                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  V-fib arrest, evaluate ET tube placement and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is present 3.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is
 present with tip coursing towards the stomach but not captured on the film. 
 An esophageal temperature probe is also noted.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Bilateral pleural effusions are not
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Diffuse hazy opacification of all lung
 fields is consistent with pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of ET tube.  Pulmonary edema. No
 pneumothorax.
