                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, for pre-discharge evaluation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, all of the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  There is no convincing evidence of a residual
 pneumothorax.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles, more prominent on the
 left, is consistent with pleural fluid.  Some volume loss is noted in the left
 lower lung.  No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
