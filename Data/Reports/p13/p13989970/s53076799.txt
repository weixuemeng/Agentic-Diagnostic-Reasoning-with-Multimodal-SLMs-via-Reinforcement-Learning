                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock  // CHF?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. A right subclavian central venous
 catheter terminates in the low SVC. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the
 proximal right pulmonary artery.  A feeding tube terminates in the stomach.
 Stable retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. There
 is minimal pulmonary edema if any.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change and marked cardiomegaly and retrocardiac
 subsegmental atelectasis.
 Stable small left pleural effusion.
