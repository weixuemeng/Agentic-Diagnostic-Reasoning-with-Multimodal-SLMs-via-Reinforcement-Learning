                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Cardiogenic shock  // CVL position/___
 position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film, the right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 repositioned, with the tip now overlying the proximal right pulmonary artery.
 The right sided central line is unchanged, tip overlying cavoatrial junction.
 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable, allowing for
 technical differences. The right and left lung bases are grossly clear, except
 for some patchy retrocardiac opacity, which appears improved. No gross
 effusion identified on either side.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Repositioning of Swan-Ganz catheter -- the tip now overlies the proximal right
 pulmonary artery.
