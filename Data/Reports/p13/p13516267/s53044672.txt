                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart failure and worsening hypotension  //
 PA catheter pulled back. In appropriate position?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated.  The repositioned right IJ approach Swan-Ganz catheter
 tip now ends in the right pulmonary artery with its tip projecting over the
 right most aspect of the mediastinal silhouette, and could be pulled back
 about 2 cm.  The right dialysis catheter remains unchanged position with its
 tip ending in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.  Lung volumes remain low.
 Slight increase dopacity in the left hemithorax may be in part secondary to
 rotation and redistribution of overall unchanged moderate-to-severe pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions persist.  The heart remains
 moderately to severely enlarged.  The pulmonary arteries are enlarged,
 suggesting chronic pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Repositioned Swan-Ganz catheter could be pulled back 2 cm.
 2.  Moderate-to-severe heart failure, possibly from volume overload.
 3.  Possible concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded - close short term
 follow-up is advised.
