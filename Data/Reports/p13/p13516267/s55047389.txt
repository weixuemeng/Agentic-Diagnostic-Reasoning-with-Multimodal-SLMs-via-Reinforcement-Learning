                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath  // eval for infiltrate,
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right
 hemodialysis catheter.  The course of the catheter is normal.  A small right
 pleural effusion is now moderate and has slightly increased in extent.  The
 pre-existing widening of the pulmonary vascular structures suggests moderate
 pulmonary edema.  The left lung apex appears minimally denser than before,
 which could be due to patient rotation.  However, short term radiographic
 followup should be performed to exclude developing pneumonia.
