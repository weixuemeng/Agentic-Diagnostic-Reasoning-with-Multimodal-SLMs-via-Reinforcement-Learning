                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contour is markedly abnormal with moderate cardiomegaly
 but marked prominence of the aortic arch, this consistent with the patient's
 known dissection and aortic root graft.  No consolidation or pneumothorax
 seen.  No pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared the prior study.  Markedly
 abnormal appearance of the thoracic aorta is similar when compared to the
 prior study.
