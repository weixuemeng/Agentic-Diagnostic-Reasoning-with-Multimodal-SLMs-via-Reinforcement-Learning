                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with possible stroke and dysarthria, rule out
 pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.  CTA torso
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate no focal consolidations to
 suggest pneumonia.  The aortic contours are unchanged with dilation of the
 aortic arch compatible with known dissection.  There are stable bibasilar
 opacities.  The trachea remains slightly deviated to the right.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  A severe dextroscoliosis is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.  No interval change from priors.
