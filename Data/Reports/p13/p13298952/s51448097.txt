                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tylenol toxicity with leukocytosis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic
 pulmonary disease and some tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  However, no
 evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
