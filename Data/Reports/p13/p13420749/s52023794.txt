 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has
 been pulled back.  The nasogastric tube has also been removed.  Pullback of
 the PICC line is affecting about 2-3 cm of its course.  The line currently
 still has a tip projecting over the mid SVC.
 
 No complications, in particular no pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the lungs and the
 heart appear unchanged.
