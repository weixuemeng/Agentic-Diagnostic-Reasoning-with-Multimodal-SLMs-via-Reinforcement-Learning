                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  The lungs are hyperinflated, demonstrating hyperlucency in the
 upper zones, compatible with COPD.  There is no pneumothorax, focal
 consolidation, or pleural effusion.  An equivocal soft tissue nodule adjacent
 to the cardiac apex may represnt the left nipple. Linear bibasilar opacities
 are most compatible with atelectasis.  Tenodesis screws are seen within the
 left humeral head.  The patient is post-cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Hyperinflated lungs with upper zone hyperlucency, compatible with
 emphysema.  No superimposed acute intrathoracic process seen.
 2. Possible nodule adjacent to the cardiac apex, which may be the left nipple.
 If clinically indicated, additional shallow oblique views could be obtained
 with nipple markers.
