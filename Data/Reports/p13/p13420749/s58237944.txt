 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with small-bowel
 obstruction and NG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is coiled in the esophagus.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged in appearance including cardiomegaly.  Left basal atelectasis is
 redemonstrated as well as sutures in the left upper lung.  Small amount of
 right pleural effusion is most likely present.
