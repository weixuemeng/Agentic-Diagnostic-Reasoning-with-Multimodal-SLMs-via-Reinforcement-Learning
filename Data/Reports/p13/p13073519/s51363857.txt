 CHEST, AP
 
 The heart is within the upper limits of normal.  Increased opacities are seen
 at the right base and also in the right upper lobe and this might represent
 areas of aspiration.  The costophrenic angles appear sharp.  There is no
 evidence of failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right-sided aspiration.
