 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina, and a
 nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 normal.  Lungs are remarkable for patchy and linear bibasilar atelectasis,
 left greater than right, as well as a small left pleural effusion.
