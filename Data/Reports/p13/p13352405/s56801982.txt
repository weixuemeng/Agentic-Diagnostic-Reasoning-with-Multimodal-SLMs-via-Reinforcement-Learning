 gas filling of colon interposed between the chest wall and the liver, and
 continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Unchanged normal appearance
 of the cardiac silhouette and the left lung.  No current evidence of
 pneumothorax.

 exception of increased air with the soft tissues of the right lateral chest
 wall.
