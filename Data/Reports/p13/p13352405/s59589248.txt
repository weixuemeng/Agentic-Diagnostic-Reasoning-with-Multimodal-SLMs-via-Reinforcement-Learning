                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post right VATS decortication,
 assess for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP
 single chest view of ___.  Right-sided chest tube remains in place
 terminating somewhat lower than on the preceding study in the apical area. 
 The second lower right chest tube remains in unchanged position.  Small amount
 of right-sided pleural effusion persists blunting the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinus.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and no significant
 pneumothorax has developed in the apical area.  The left-sided hemithorax
 remains unchanged with no new infiltrates.  As before, there are local rib
 deformities apparently related to previous old trauma as already observed on
 previous chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right-sided postoperative small apical
 pneumothorax and pleural effusion.
