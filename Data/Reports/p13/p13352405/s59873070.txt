 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination from ___, the
 rounded pleural opacity (should not be mistaken for a mass) on the right,
 caused by encapsulated pleural effusion, has almost completely resolved.  The
 right pleural effusion has decreased in extent.  However, there is elevation
 of the hemidiaphragm, a small basal pleural effusion and subsequent areas of
 atelectasis.
 
 On the left, the lung parenchyma now appears normal.  Healed left rib
 fractures are visible.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
