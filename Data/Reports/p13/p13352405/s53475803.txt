                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with right VATS for empyema
 due to complicated pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Tortuous aorta is re-demonstrated. 
 Right pleural effusion appears to be unchanged/minimally smaller since the
 prior study, again most likely loculated posteriorly and laterally.  Aeration
 of the right lower lung has minimally improved.  Left lung is essentially
 clear.  Multiple rib fractures are re-demonstrated bilaterally.
