                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided empyema, now on
 antibiotic treatment for three weeks.  Recently off antibiotics.  Evaluate
 chest tubes and their position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Moderate elevation of right-sided hemidiaphragm as before.  Two
 chest tubes entered from the lower lateral chest wall terminate in unchanged
 position, draining the area of the previous empyema.  The lowermost of the two
 tubes is in unchanged position, whereas the higher ending tube has been
 withdrawn by a few centimeters, but still remains in place.  The size of the
 pleural density that forms a triangular thickening of the right lateral and
 posterior pleural space has decreased slightly in comparison with the next
 previous study.  There is no evidence of any new cavitation, loculated
 pneumothorax or other new parenchymal abnormalities.  The left-sided
 hemithorax remains completely unchanged and within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild regression of pleural thickenings, no new abnormalities, no
 pneumothorax.
