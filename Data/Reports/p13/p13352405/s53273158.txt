                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with empyema, status post right VATS,
 then thoracotomy decortication on ___.  Right-sided empyema, tubes pulled
 back to ___ and 16 cm.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Mediastinal and cardiac structures are unchanged.  Thus, no
 evidence of cardiac enlargement.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 Right-sided status post decortication procedure as before.  Unchanged moderate
 degree of diaphragmatic elevation.  The previously described two pleural
 drainage chest tubes remain in position.  Comparison shows that both tubes
 have been withdrawn by up to 2 cm, but basically, the position is unaltered. 
 No pneumothorax has developed.  No remaining pneumothorax is seen in the
 apical areas.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory findings on followup examinations.  Minor change in
 chest tube positions as expected.
