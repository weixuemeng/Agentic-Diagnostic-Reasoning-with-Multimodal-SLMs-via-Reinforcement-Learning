                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with C. diff septic shock, now re-intubated for
 hypoxemic respiratory failure  // Post-intubation CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is terminates in the lower trachea. A right IJ central
 venous catheter extends into the upper right atrium. The nasogastric tube
 terminates in the stomach. Stable retrocardiac airspace opacification is
 likely due to a combination of atelectasis and infection.  The left
 costophrenic angle has been excluded from the field of view. However, a small
 left pleural effusion is essentially unchanged. The previous right pleural
 effusion has decreased with improved aeration of the right lower lobe. 
 Bilateral perihilar airspace opacities have decreased since the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration at the right base with stable retrocardiac atelectasis or
 infection.
 Stable small left pleural effusion.
 Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
