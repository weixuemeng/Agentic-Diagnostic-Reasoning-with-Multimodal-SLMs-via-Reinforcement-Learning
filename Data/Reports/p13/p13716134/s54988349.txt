 Lung volumes are quite low.  Greater opacification at the lung bases is most
 likely atelectasis, but early pneumonia is not excluded, neither is dependent
 pulmonary edema, especially given the history of fluid resuscitation.  Upper
 lungs are clear.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Azygos caliber is top
 normal and the heart is not enlarged.
 Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  No
 pneumothorax.
