                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph, ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Right hilar mass compatible with non-small cell lung cancer is
 again demonstrated.  Worsening opacification of the right lower lobe is
 concerning for postobstructive pneumonia with blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle compatible with a small pleural effusion, new from the
 prior study.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle also is suggestive of trace fluid. 
 Streaky left basilar opacity is compatible with atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
 No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.  Cholecystectomy clips are
 again seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent right hilar mass compatible with known malignancy with worsening
 right lower lobe opacification concerning for postobstructive pneumonia. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Left basilar atelectasis.
