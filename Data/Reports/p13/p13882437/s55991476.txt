 INDICATION:  History of placement of LV lead via subclavian with obstructed
 vein.  Please rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly, which appears stable
 compared to the prior exam, however, increased in size compared to the exam
 from ___.  Chronic left mediastinal shift is redemonstrated, most
 likely secondary to pleural thickening and potential atelectasis at the left
 lung base.  Again seen is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild
 bilateral pulmonary edema.  The pacemaker lead terminates in the expected
 position of the right ventricle.  There appears to be a stable small left
 pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No evidence of a pneumothorax.  Stable appearance of the chest otherwise.
