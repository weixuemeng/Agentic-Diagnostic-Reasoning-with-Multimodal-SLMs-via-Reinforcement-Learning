 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker lead terminates in the expected location of the right ventricle. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Chronic left mediastinal

 atelectasis at the left lung base.  As compared to the prior study, there is
 minimal vascular engorgement, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
