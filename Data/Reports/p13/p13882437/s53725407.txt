                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new left ventricle lead placement.  Assess lead
 position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the patient in
 the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The indwelling left subclavian lead ends in the right ventricle as before, and
 the new lead travels along the chest wall through the right subclavian vein
 and ends outside the left ventricle.  Previous left pleural effusion has
 decreased to baseline, and the left mediastinal shift has resolved, but the
 left lower lobe collapse that followed the new lead placement has not fully
 resolved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged without pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Left lower atelelctasis improved. Tunneled transvenous left ventricular pacer
 lead follows right subclavian approach.
