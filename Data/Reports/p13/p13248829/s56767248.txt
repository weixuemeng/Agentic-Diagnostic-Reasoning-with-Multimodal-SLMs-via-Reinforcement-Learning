                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube, evaluate for change in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ from 10:50 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is provided.  A pigtail catheter
 is present within the right mid pleural space.  There has been reexpansion of
 the lung with essential resolution of the large pneumothorax with a small
 residual pneumothorax remaining.  Opacity in the right mid-lung may represent
 atlectasis.  The left lung is clear except for left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Median sternotomy wires are noted.  The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. 
 Right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: Large pneumothorax has essentially resolved with small residual
 pneumothorax.
