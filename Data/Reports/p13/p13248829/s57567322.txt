                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Spontaneous pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:  AP image of the chest.  The chest tube is seen in the right mid
 chest.  The lungs are well expanded.  There is more vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema than on prior exam, consistent with the patient being in early
 heart failure.  Opacity at the right lung base likely represents atelectasis. 
 There has been interval increase in the right pneumothorax since most recent
 exam, however this pneumothorax is still much smaller than that seen on the
 exam prior to the most recent exam.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Interval increase in right-sided pneumothorax.  
 
 2.  Increased vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, consistent with early
 heart failure.
