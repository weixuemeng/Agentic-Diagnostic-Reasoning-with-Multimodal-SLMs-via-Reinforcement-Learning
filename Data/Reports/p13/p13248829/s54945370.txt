 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post VATS blebectomy and pleurodesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is volume loss in the right hemithorax as well as pleural thickening, although
 the latter appears decreased.  There is no pneumothorax.  A small amount of
 residual subcutaneous air is noted in right lateral soft tissues.  A small
 quantity of fluid is present along the right major fissure, but there is no
 suspicion for substantial pleural effusion.  Severe degenerative changes again
 involve the right glenohumeral joint.
