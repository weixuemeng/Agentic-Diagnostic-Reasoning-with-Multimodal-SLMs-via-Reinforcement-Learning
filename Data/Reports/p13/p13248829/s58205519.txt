                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right VATS blebectomy
 and pleurodesis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right chest tube is in place.  There is slight interval worsening of the
 aeration of the right lung which potentially may be due to increase in pleural
 effusion.  There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette and there is
 questionable left mid lung opacity, that might potentially reflect developing
 infectious process.  Air in the right chest wall appears to be slightly
 decreasing.
