                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CKD with worsening dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size remains
 moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged with unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta. Volume loss in the right lung is again demonstrated.  There is
 continued right pleural thickening laterally and inferiorly with fluid
 overlying the right apex, not substantially changed in the interval. Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis. There may be minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. There is no
 left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. There are mild
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change compared to the previous study.
