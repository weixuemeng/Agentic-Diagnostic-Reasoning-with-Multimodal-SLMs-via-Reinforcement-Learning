  Increased opacity at the right lung base may relate to decreased lung volumes,
  however an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There
  are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent knee surgery, fever.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS: As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung
 volumes are decreased. There are diffusely prominent interstitial markings
 which likely reflect diffuse pulmonary edema, infection less likely. There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Prominent interstitial markings likely reflect diffuse pulmonary edema, an
 infection less likely.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
