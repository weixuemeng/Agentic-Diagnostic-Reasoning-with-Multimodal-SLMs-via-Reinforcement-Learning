                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left renal mass after
 nephrectomy, now with chest pain.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Subcutaneous air is noted
 within the left chest wall continuing all the way up to the neck and might be
 consistent with not radiographically identified pneumothorax.  Minimal
 bibasilar, left more than right, atelectasis is demonstrated.  Correlation
 with lateral view may be considered.
