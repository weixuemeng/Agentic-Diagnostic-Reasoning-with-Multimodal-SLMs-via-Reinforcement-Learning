  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely due to projection. 
  Apparent enlargement of the right hilum could also be similar although
  underlying pulmonary artery enlargement or adenopathy is possible.  Consider
  repeat PA and lateral if patient is amenable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever cough and RR 40  // eval for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are grossly clear.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and prominent
 appearance of the mediastinum is likely due to AP portable technique. 
 Prominence of the right hilum is also noted.  There is no large effusion or
 confluent consolidation.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely due to projection.  Apparent
 enlargement of the right hilum could also be similar although underlying
 pulmonary artery enlargement or adenopathy is possible.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Consider repeat PA and lateral if patient is amenable to
 further assess.
