                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sharp pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there may be a subtle right base opacity which could be
 due to consolidation versus atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively low lung volumes.  Subtle right lower lobe opacity could be due to
 consolidation versus atelectasis.  Underlying pulmonary infarct cannot be
 excluded on this study.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
