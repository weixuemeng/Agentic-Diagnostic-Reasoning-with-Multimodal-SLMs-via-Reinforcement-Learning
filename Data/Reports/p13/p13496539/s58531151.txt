 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:16 PM
  Exam limited by low lung volumes and patient positioning.  Right pneumothorax
  remains moderate although slightly smaller in size.  Right air-fluid level is
  less apparent.  Prominence of pulmonary vasculature may be due to crowding or
  mild vascular congestion.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post pacemaker placement, right hydropneumothorax,
 worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:37 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The extent of the right fluidopneumothorax is unchanged.  The level

 evidence of tension.  At lower lung volumes, there is increased crowding of
 the vascular and bronchial structures in the left lung.  The appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
