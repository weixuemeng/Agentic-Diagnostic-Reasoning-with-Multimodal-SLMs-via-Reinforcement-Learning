 AP CHEST, 5:29 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a chest tube removed.  Follow up
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ 12:51 p.m.:
 
 I see no pneumothorax, but if this is a supine view, anterior pneumothorax
 could be present given the considerable clarity of the right lower hemithorax.
 This or another upright view should be obtained.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
