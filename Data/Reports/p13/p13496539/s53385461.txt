                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum overall are unchanged.  The pigtail catheter is in
 place on the right.  There is interval slight increase in the subcutaneous
 air.  No definitive pneumothorax is currently seen on the right.  A left basal
 atelectasis is present.  Lucency projecting over the lower lung on the right
 might actually reflect small amount of pneumothorax and should be further
 followed.
