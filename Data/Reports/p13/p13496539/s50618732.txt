                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:08 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a pneumothorax after chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, most recently 12:17 p.m.:
 
 Right apical component of pneumothorax is small.  Basal component is hard to
 assess if any, but there has been appreciable reexpansion of the right lung
 following insertion of the pleural drain which terminates medially in the
 right lower chest, as before.  Lung volumes are low, but I can still say there
 is no pulmonary edema or substantial atelectasis.  Heart is normal size. 
 Atrioventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
