                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis and pneumonia on recent CT scan.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT abdomen ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right upper extremity PICC has been removed.  There are increased
 opacities seen throughout the right lung, most prominent along the minor
 fissure.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident. 
 The left lung is grossly clear.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The upper abdominal drains are noted but incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy opacification throughout the right lung, worse in the right
 upper lobe, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
