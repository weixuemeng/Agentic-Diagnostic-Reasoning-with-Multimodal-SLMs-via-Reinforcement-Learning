                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever, longterm cough.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___ and several radiographs
 from ___ and ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Right upper lobe consolidation has increased with
 increasing loss of volume.  Right lower lobe opacities have minimally
 improved.  Ill-defined rounded opacities projecting over the anterior first
 left rib are likely degenerative changes in the first sternochondral joint. 
 Infrahilar opacities have increased.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusions.  If any, there is a small left effusion.
 
 Catheter project in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia.  Given the fact that has a same
 distribution from prior studies, CT is recommended to exclude an underlying
 malignancy or other type of lung abnormality.
