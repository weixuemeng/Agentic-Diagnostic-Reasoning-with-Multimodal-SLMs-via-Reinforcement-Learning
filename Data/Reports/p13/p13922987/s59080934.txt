                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of multifocal pneumonia, as manifested by opacities in the right upper lobe
 and the right lower lobe.  The opacities are seen on both the frontal and
 lateral radiograph.  The only difference to the prior film is that the
 ventilation of the left lung base has minimally increased.  The lateral
 radiograph also reveals the presence of a small pleural effusion.
 
 Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
