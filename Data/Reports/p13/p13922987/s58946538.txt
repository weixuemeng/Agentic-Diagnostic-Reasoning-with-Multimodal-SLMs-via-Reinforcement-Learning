                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Substantial increase in white blood cell count.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.  The right PICC line
 tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.  There is interval development of
 opacities within the right hemithorax involving right upper and right lower
 lobes as well as potential nodular densities projecting over the right upper
 lobe as well.  The findings are concerning for infectious process with the
 septic emboli being additional potential consideration.  Assessment of the
 patient with chest CT might be considered at this point.
 
 Alternatively, those findings may reflect interval changes in the pre-existing
 cavitated nodule seen on the CT of the chest from ___.  With any
 suspected differential diagnosis, correlation with chest CT should be
 considered.
