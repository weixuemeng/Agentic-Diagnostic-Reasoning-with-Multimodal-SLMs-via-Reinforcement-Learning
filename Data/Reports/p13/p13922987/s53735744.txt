                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count.  Is there pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Chronic consolidation in the right upper lobe, which remained substantial
 through ___, has improved, and scarring is responsible for more rightward
 shift of the ipsilateral hilus and upper mediastinum.  Small right pleural
 effusion is new.  Left lung is clear, and there is no left pleural effusion. 
 Heart size is normal.  There are no findings to suggest pneumonia, but the
 recurrence of fever is less likely to be due to the consolidation since it is
 healing and points instead to the right upper abdominal quadrant where air and
 fluid collections are now seen.
