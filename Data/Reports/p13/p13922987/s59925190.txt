                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Complex medical history with history of polymicrobial bacteremia,
 complicated hospital course including ARDS, septic shock.  Please assess for
 aspiration or acute pulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  
 
 There are patchy opacities throughout much of both lungs, most pronounced in
 the right upper and left lower zones.  Subtler changes are likely present in
 other areas of the lung.  
 
 Compared with ___, the appearance is fairly similar, though perhaps
 slightly more pronounced in both the right upper zone and left base.   
 Compared with ___, the appearance is probably slightly more pronounced at
 left base, though not definitely changed in the right upper zone.  On today's
 film, changes at the left base have a more branching, nodular appearance than
 on the two prior films. Compared to a more remote film from ___, the
 appearance is more similar, but remains slightly worse at the left base.
 
 The appearance is not suggestive of CHF and no effusions are identified.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  Apparent drain-like tubing overlying the upper
 abdomen, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy opacities in both lungs, which have been present on multiple films
 and are consistent with ongoing multifocal pneumonia. There appears to be some
 recent interval worsening of findings in the right upper zone, though, over
 the long term, these have waxed and waned.  Findings at the left base appear
 more pronounced compared with multiple prior films obtained since ___. 
 2.  Doubt CHF.
 3.  No effusion.
