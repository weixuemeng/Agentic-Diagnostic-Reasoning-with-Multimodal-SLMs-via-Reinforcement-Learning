                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cholangitis, cholecystitis, status
 post drainage, now with fevers, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable single view
 chest examination of ___.  Heart size, thoracic aorta and hilar
 structures remain unchanged and are within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of new acute parenchymal infiltrates
 are present.  A new finding is a small amount of pleural effusion blunting the
 left lateral pleural sinus slightly and is seen to extend into the posterior
 pleural sinus as observed on the lateral wall.  Apparently, this pleural
 effusion is new since the preceding chest examination probably related to the
 recently performed abdominal intervention.
