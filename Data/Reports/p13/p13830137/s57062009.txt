                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p re-intubation ___ resp failure  //
 eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Compared with ___ at 05:40, an ET tube is
 now present, tip borderline low, 1.9 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Left IJ central line tip
 again overlies the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but probably unchanged. 
 Again seen is hazy density in the right mid can lower zones, consistent with
 pleural effusion can underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The degree of
 vascular plethora  in the right upper zone may be slightly increased, but
 there is also considerable artifact due to overlying materials.  On the left,
 no overt CHF.  Patchy opacity at the retrocardiac region is similar to the
 prior film.  No left effusion.
 
 Old healed right rib fractures and tapered left clavicle again noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of ET tube.  The tube lies borderline low, approximately
 1.9 cm above the carina.  Clinical correlation regarding possible retraction
 by 1 cm is requested.
 2. Suspect large right effusion with underlying collapse are the
 consolidation, similar to the prior film.
 3. Equivocal increase in vascular plethora in the right upper zone -- this
 area is considerably obscured by artifact due to overlying materials.
 4. Patchy opacity at the left base is similar to the prior film.  No
 significant left-sided vascular plethora and no left pleural effusion.
