                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p exlap SBR, please eval for fluid overload 
 // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, an endotracheal tube has been
 repositioned, with tip now terminating 2 cm above the carinal with the neck
 apparently in a flexed position.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening
 bibasilar atelectasis and apparent slight increase in size of a small right
 pleural effusion although positional differences likely contribute to this
 apparent change.
