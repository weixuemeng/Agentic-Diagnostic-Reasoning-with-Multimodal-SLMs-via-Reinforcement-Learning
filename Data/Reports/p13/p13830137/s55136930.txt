                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old F cirrotic, s/p SBR, altered mental status, extubated
 // assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.  A nasogastric
 tube terminates in the stomach.  There has been an interval increase in the
 right pleural effusion, now moderate.  There is associated increased
 opacification of the right lung base likely reflecting atelectasis but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The left lung appears grossly
 clear.  Borderline cardiomegaly with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
