                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SBR, NGT in place  // confirm NGT
 placement      confirm NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right PICC line and
 endotracheal tube have been removed.  Otherwise, little change and no evidence
 of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube is in the mid to lower stomach, with the side
 port just distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Pushing the tube forward an
 additional 5 cm would result in more optimal placement.
