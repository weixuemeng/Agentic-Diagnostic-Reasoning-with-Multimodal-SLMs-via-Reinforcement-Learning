                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. Heart size
 remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aortic knob
 is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with enlargement of
 the main pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases
 may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Enlargement of the pulmonary
 arteries compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
