 streaky atelectasis at the lung bases, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The lungs
 are hyperinflated with relative paucity of the pulmonary vascular markings
 towards the apices compatible with mild to moderate centrilobular emphysema. 
 Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
