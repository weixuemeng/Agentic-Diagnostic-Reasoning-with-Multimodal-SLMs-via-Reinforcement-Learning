                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Retrocardiac opacity is poorly seen on this single view but could
 reflect atelectasis or developing infectious process.  Lungs are somewhat low
 in volume giving the appearance of vascular crowding, though mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present as well.  Mild right base atelectasis is noted,
 early infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Cardiac size
 is moderately enlarged with changes of prior coronary bypass graft noted.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Retrocardiac opacity incompletely assessed on this single view could
 reflect atelectasis or developing infectious process.  Mild right base
 atelectasis is noted, early infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Consider PA and lateral radiographs for further evaluation.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
