                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after sternal debridement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 The AP chest radiograph demonstrates that the patient is currently intubated
 with the ET tube tip being 4 cm above the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are grossly stable.  The sternum cannot be assessed on the current study. 
 Minimal opacities in the upper lobes appear to be unchanged since the prior
 examination.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
