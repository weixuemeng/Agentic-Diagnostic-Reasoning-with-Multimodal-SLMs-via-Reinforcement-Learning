                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___, as
 well as a CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer, metastatic from the pancreas with two days of
 increased shortness of breath and productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Port-A-Cath is
 again seen, residing over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending
 into the low SVC or cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are low which limits
 the evaluation.  Scattered opacities in the lungs are similar to the prior CT
 and likely represent metastasis seen on prior CT.  It is impossible to exclude
 a subtle superimposed pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Bony structures appear grossly intact.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar pattern to bilateral lung opacities which represents
 known metastatic disease.  Impossible to exclude superimposed subtle
 pneumonia.
