                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer with acute respiratory distress, assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple previous examinations most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extensive left greater than right pulmonary opacities predominantly accounted
 for by known metastatic disease and fibrotic changes are similar in degree. 
 More confluent opacities in the left lower lobe are similar to the previous
 study allowing for differences in lung volumes and could reflect aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present without
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured but appears grossly stable. 
 Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive pulmonary opacities accounted for by known metastatic disease and
 fibrotic changes with more confluent left lower lobar opacities which could
 reflect aspiration or an infectious process in the appropriate clinical
 setting, or relate to the underlying metastatic disease.
