                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, cancer metastatic to lung.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the cavoatrial junction. 
 Abnormal mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with evidence of
 lymphadenopathy, better depicted on the recent chest CT.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess given the presence of widespread pulmonary parenchymal
 opacities in both lungs. These pulmonary opacities appear progressed when
 compared to the prior chest radiograph, but are similar when compared to the
 prior chest CT, and findings are compatible with diffuse metastatic disease
 superimposed on a background of fibrosis.  No pleural effusion is detected. 
 There is no pneumothorax or definite evidence of pulmonary edema.  No definite
 acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread parenchymal opacities in both lungs, progressed when compared to
 prior chest radiograph but likely similar compared to the prior chest CT.
 Findings are compatible with metastatic disease superimposed on a background
 of fibrosis.
