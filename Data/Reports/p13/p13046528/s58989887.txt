                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and weakness.  History of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  At the left base, the hazy opacification has become more confluent
 in comparison to the prior CT scout view from ___.  This may
 represent new infection, lymphangitic spread of his known metastatic disease,
 or less likely, atelectasis.  Mild opacification in the right upper lobe and
 left apex is unchanged.  The patient is status post a left upper lobectomy.  A
 prominent left hilum likely again seen.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the atriocaval
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing opacification of the left base may reflect infection,
 aspiration, lymphangitic spread of the patient's known metastatic disease, or
 less likely,atelectasis.
 2.  Stable opacifications in the bilateral apices are likely due to metastatic
 disease or scarring.
 3.  Known metastatic disease.
