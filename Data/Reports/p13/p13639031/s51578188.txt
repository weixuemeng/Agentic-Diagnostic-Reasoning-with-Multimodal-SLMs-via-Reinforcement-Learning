                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia and palpitations.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected on this single frontal view.  Lung markings and
 pulmonary vasculature are exaggerated at the lung bases, possibly due to low
 lung volumes and overlying soft tissues.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal evaluation of the lung bases due to low lung volumes and absence of
 lateral radiograph without evidence for pneumonia on this single frontal view.
 If there is high clinical suspicion, dedicated PA and lateral chest
 radiographs are recommended.
