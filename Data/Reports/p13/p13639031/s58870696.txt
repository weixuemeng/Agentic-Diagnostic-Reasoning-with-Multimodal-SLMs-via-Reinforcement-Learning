                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a developing opacity in the right
 medial lower lung, partly obscuring the right hemidiaphragm and perhaps
 involving both the right middle and lower lobes.  Elsewhere, the lung fields
 remain clear.  Bony structures appear normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Developing right lower lung opacities worrisome for pneumonia.
