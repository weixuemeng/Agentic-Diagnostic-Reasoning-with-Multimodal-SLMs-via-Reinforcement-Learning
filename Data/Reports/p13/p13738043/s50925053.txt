                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.  Known rib fracture.  Question pulmonary contusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___ and radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There are multiple mildly displaced left-sided rib
 fractures, which were better characterized on the recent CT.  Adjoining
 parenchymal opacity appears similar to mildly increased.  Small quantities of
 subcutaneous emphysema appear more prominent on this study although whether
 this is due to redistribution of previously existing air or due to ongoing air
 leak is uncertain.  Of note, however, there is no clear evidence for
 pneumothorax.  A right posterior basilar opacity suggests atelectasis. 
 Increasing opacity near the site of rib fractures may be due to increasing
 pleural fluid, atelectasis or hemorrhage.
