                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pneumothorax, status post pigtail
 placement, evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  On the present examination, the patient is mildly rotated
 to the left, which accounts for slightly asymmetric presentation of the
 frontal chest view.  The heart size remains within normal limits.  No
 pulmonary congestive pattern is identified.  A left-sided pneumothorax has
 increased and is specifically well demonstrated along the left lateral chest
 wall and the basis at the diaphragmatic level where an air-fluid level can be
 identified.  There is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left-sided pneumothorax with significant reduction of
 pulmonary tissue in comparison with the previous examination.  Immediate
 efforts were made to alert the referring physician, ___. ___.  As she
 could not be reached, responsible nurse ___, ___, was
 reached by telephone and informed about the changes at 5:50 p.m.
