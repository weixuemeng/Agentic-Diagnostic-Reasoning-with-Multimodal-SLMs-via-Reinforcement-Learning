                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer and recurrent left pneumothorax status post talc
 pleurodesis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
 hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragm consistent with emphysema. 
 Chronic left pleural effusion is essentially unchanged.  Linear scarring in
 the left mid lung zone is a consequence of pleurodesis.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left pleural effusion and linear scarring in the left
 mid lung zone with no evidence of pneumothorax.
