                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  Reference made to a previous chest x-ray report performed
 earlier today ___, ___ at 4:58 PM
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate left pleural effusion without findings to suggest tension.
 There is no mediastinal shift.  There may be a small left pleural effusion. 
 Left perihilar opacity and retraction is seen, which is likely chronic and may
 relate to patient's history of lung cancer.  Subtle left lower lung,
 infrahilar opacity may relate to decreased left lung volume or could relate to
 history of malignancy, given no prior imaging available for comparison.  Left
 lung base atelectasis/scarring is seen.  The right lung is clear and
 hyperinflated, likely due to underlying COPD.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  Minimally displaced
 fracture of the posterior left 7th rib is seen.  There are also fracture
 deformities of the more superior ribs, including the left posterior ___ and
 5th ribs of indeterminate age and possibly the posterior left 3rd rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate left pneumothorax without findings to suggest tension.  Possible
 small left pleural effusion.  Left-sided rib fractures, as above, some of
 which may be subacute.
 
 2. Left perihilar opacity is likely chronic.  Left infrahilar/lower lobe
 opacity most likely relates to decreased lung volume /atelectasis due to the
 left pneumothorax, however, could relate to patient's malignancy, prior
 imaging is not available for comparison.
 
 The above findings were discussed with Dr. ___ in the ___ emergency
 department at 18:40 on ___ via telephone ___ min after discovery.
