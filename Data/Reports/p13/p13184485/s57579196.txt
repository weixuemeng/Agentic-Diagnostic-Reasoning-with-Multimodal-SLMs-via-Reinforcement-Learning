 INDICATION:  Status post left thoracocentesis, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a

 evidence of complications such as pneumothorax.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left lung base persists.  The left PICC line is unchanged, the line projects
 over the right atrium and could be pulled back by approximately 4 cm.  New
 parenchymal opacities.
