                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and oxygen requirement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Lung volumes are low.  The right
 heart border is obscured, but the heart is likely normal size.  Mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Right lower and middle lobe opacity with indistinctness
 of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle likely
 represents a combination of effusion and consolidation.  Left lung is clear. 
 No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small right pleural effusion with right base opacity, either atelectasis or
 infection.
