 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, worsening pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased.  The signs evocative of pulmonary edema are constant in
 severity and extent.  Constant moderate cardiomegaly, potential small right
 pleural effusion.  Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.  Deviation of the
 trachea is unchanged as compared to the prior image.
