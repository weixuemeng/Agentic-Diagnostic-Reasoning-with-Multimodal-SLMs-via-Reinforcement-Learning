                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 1 portable AP supine view of the chest.  Lung volumes are increased, in
 keeping with history of COPD. Bronchial wall thickening may reflect acute or
 chronic bronchitis. New left lower lobe patchy opacity. Bibasilar reticular
 opacities are unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe opacity may be due to aspiration, atelectasis or
 developing pneumonia. 
 
 Suspected underlying chronic lung parenchymal and airway disease in this
 patient with COPD, incompletely evaluated on this portable CXR.
 
 PA and lateral CXR recommended when the patient's condition permits.
