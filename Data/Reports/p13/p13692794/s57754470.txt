                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:50 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with multifocal pneumonia, question change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 5:31.
 
 A portable upright chest film on ___ at 5:50 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is increase in confluent opacity in the right upper and central lung
 as well as in the left lower lung.  Given the asymmetry and more consolidative
 appearance this would favor  multifocal pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  There is likely a layering left effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
