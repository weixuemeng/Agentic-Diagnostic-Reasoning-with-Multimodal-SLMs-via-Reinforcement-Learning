                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia in ___.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study from ___, there has been
 interval resolution of extensive bilateral mid lung and right upper lung
 opacities.  Linear atelectasis/scarring is seen in the right mid-to-lower
 lung.  There is also minimal left lower lung atelectasis.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Surgical clips overlie the cervical region, as
 before.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval resolution of previously seen bilateral mid lung and right upper
 lung opacities, consistent with resolved pneumonia.
 
 2.  Linear right mid-to-lower lung opacities, likely scarring versus
 atelectasis.  Minimal left lower lung atelectasis.
