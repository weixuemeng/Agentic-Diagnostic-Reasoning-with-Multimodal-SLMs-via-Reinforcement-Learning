                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV (CD4 ___), here with pneumonia being
 treated for HCAP and PCP, ___/o TB, now with worsening tachypnea.  // Evaluate
 for interval change, any pulmonary edema or acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Single AP view of the chest.  Multiple views were likely
 performed to include the extreme inferior costophrenic sulci.  Additional post
 processed versions present.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, the right infrahilar opacity is similar, but
 slightly less pronounced.  Opacity along the  left heart border may be
 slightly less pronounced.  Subtle findings at the right lung apex are probably
 similar, allowing for differences in technique.
 
 No gross effusions.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is  grossly unchanged.
 
 Left-sided PICC line tip lies at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal opacities again seen.  There has been very slight interval
 improvement of the right and left infrahilar opacities, compared to earlier
 the same day.
 
 No pleural effusions.
