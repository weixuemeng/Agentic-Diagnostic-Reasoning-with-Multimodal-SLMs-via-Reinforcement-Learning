                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the previous examination.  Heart size
 appears mildly enlarged, slightly increased from prior, likely related to the
 decreased lung volumes.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears new in the interval. More focal
 patchy opacity is seen within the medial right lung base, which could reflect
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes compared to prior.  Mild pulmonary edema, new in the
 interval.  Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
