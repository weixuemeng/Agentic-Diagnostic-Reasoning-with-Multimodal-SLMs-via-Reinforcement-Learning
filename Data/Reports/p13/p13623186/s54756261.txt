 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemia, reintubated for respiratory
 distress.  // ETT placement      ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring support
 devices are unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications have
 increased, suggesting significant pulmonary edema.  Left hemidiaphragm is not
 well seen, most likely related to pleural fluid and volume loss in left lower
 lobe.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could not be
 excluded.
