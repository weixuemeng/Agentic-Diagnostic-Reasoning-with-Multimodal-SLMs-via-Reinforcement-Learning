                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever postop.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and preop evaluation from ___.
 
 Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  There is opacity projecting
 over the left posterior costophrenic angle, likely small effusion with
 underlying atelectasis.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Surgical clips and catheter is seen
 within the upper abdomen.  Prominent loops of bowel are seen in the upper
 abdomen, for which clinical correlation is suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes.  Blunting of posterior costophrenic angle
 likely due to small effusion and underlying atelectasis, clinical correlation
 suggested regarding possible infection.
 
 Postoperative changes with prominent loops of bowel in the upper abdomen, for
 which clinical correlation suggested and additional imaging can be performed
 as clinically indicated.
