                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, history of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  On
 frontal view there are two nodular densities projecting over the right lower
 lung field measuring 1.9 and 1.5 cm with additional large rounded density
 projecting over the posterior lung field inferiorly measuring 3.7 cm which
 overlap with ribs and vertebral bodies.  The hilar contours are mildly full
 which may represent lymphadenopathy.  Numerous subcentimeter nodular densities
 projecting over the left lung field.  There is no evidence of edema.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Several left sided nodules.  Additional larger sclerotic foci
 projecting over ribs on the right and vertebral column on the lateral, which
 may represent degenerative change, however, further evaluation with CT is
 warranted.
