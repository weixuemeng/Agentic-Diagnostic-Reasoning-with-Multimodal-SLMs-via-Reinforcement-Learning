                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar and, in particular, right middle lobe airspace opacities are again
 noted.  Upper lungs are clear bilaterally.  There is no evidence pneumothorax,
 pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right middle lobe airspace opacity which appears similar to several prior
 examinations, and may represent recurrent atelectasis versus
 pneumonia/aspiration.
