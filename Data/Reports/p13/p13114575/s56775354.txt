                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of shortness of breath.  Please evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours appear to be exaggerated due to low
 lung volumes.  Subtle opacities at the left lung base are likely secondary to
 atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity at the left lateral lung base may be secondary to
 atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
