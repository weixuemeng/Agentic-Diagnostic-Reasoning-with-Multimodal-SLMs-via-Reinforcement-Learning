                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever, post op  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the left subclavian central line with tip over proximal/mid SVC.
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with a calcified unfolded aorta and mild
 prominence of both hila with a tapered appearance.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly improved.  There is continued upper zone
 redistribution, vascular plethora, and mild vascular blurring, consistent with
 CHF and interstitial edema, which may also be very slightly improved.  Faint
 hazy opacity in the left perihilar/infrahilar and  right infrahilar area is
 noted, question reflecting CHF.
 
 Again seen is in is retrocardiac opacity.  This appears more pronounced and
 there has been interval obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  This possibility
 of a small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 At the extreme edge of these films, fusion/fixation hardware is noted in the
 cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and CHF, similar, possibly slightly improved compared with ___.
 
 Progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with new
 obscuration of left hemidiaphragm.  This appears includes the possibility of
 an associated left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate Small left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.
