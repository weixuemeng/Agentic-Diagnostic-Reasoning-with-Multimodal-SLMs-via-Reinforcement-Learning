 process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe he and
 small pleural effusion.  Less prominent effusion and atelectasis is seen on
 the right.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to completely
 exclude superimposed pneumonia in the lower lungs, especially in the absence
 of a lateral view.
 Incidental note is a cervical spinal fusion device.
