                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PICC
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size
 is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar with crowding of the bronchovascular structures noted.  While there
 may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no overt pulmonary edema is
 demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present with
 chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again noted.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is present, more pronounced on the right.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left PICC tip in the upper SVC.  Low lung volumes.  Probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
