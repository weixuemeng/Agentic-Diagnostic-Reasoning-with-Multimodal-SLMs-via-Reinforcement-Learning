 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, likely secondary to lack of inspiratory effort.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  No focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinum is not
 widened.  The hila are unremarkable.  The descending aorta is slightly
 tortuous.  There is slight blunting of the lateral border of the descending
 aorta, likely atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute intrathoracic process.
 2. No mediastinal widening.
