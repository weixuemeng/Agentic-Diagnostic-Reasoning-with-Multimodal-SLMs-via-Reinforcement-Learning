 cannot be fully excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe opacity, likely
 atelectasis though pneumonia not excluded.
