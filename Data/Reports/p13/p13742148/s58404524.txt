                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with oxygen desaturation.  Suspect pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lateral view shows two regions of basal consolidation, one on each side.  The
 region on the left is larger, but has an element of volume loss.  Either it
 could be acute pneumonia.  Pleural effusions are small on the left, tiny on
 the right.  There is also a poorly defined region of relatively mild
 peribronchial opacification in the right lung with straight lateral margin at
 the level of the mid clavicular line extending from the first rib through
 second anterior interspace.  This could be readily explained if the patient
 has had radiation therapy to the area, but failing that, I don't know the
 explanation.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema.
