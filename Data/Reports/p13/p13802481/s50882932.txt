                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man postoperative day #2 after robotic-assisted
 laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Now with leukocytosis.  Assessment for free
 air.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There is no evidence of intraperitoneal free air.  Some air-fluid
 levels are seen within the small bowel.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or significant pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 normal.  On the lateral view, there is a small rectangular-shaped radiopacity
 overlying the mid thoracic spine posteriorly, likely representing an overlying
 rib.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No evidence of intraperitoneal free air.  Multiple air-fluid
 levels are seen in the small bowel.  Rectangular radiopacity overlying the
 posterior thoracic spine likely represents a rib shadow.  However if clinical
 concern exists, when feasible, repeat PA and lateral radiographs with shallow
 lateral obliques would be recommended to resolve this finding.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone at
 11:45, at the time of discovery.
