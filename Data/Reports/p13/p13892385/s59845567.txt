                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post bilateral lung transplant in ___ with abdominal pain. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the outside CT from the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right pleural effusion and consolidation is better appreciated on the CT. 
 Additional right sided parenchymal abnormalities scattered through the upper
 lung zones could represent a chronic process, although superimposed infection
 should be considered.  Comparison with old chest x-ray would be helpful.  The
 left costophrenic angle is blunted from a small amount of scarring at the lung
 bases as well as a tiny effusion is seen on the CT from the same day.  Heart
 size is normal.  Suture material is noted in both lungs.  An internal jugular
 approach catheter on the left terminates in the mid superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lower lobe consolidation and effusion. Tiny left pleural effusion.
 Additional increased opacities throughout the right lung could represent a
 chronic process although multifocal pneumonia could be considered. Comparison
 with prior chest x-rays would be helpful.
