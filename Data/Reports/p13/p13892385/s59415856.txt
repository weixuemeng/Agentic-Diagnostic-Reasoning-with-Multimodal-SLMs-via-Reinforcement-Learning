                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non ketotic coma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT torso ___. Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top-normal with mild unfolding of the thoracic aortic arch.
 Prominent engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without interstitial edema.
 Right hilus is prominent.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 corresponding to scarring on same-day CT. Linear scarring in the left apex
 with prominent volume loss and secondary hyperexpansion of the left lower lobe
 accounting for increased lucency.. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Prominent pulmonary vascular engorgement without interstitial edema. 
 However, the right hilus is large and even with comparison to recent CT,
 lymphadenopathy or hilar mass cannot be excluded given lack of IV contrast on
 that study.  Further evaluation with contrast enhanced CT, if possible, is
 recommended.
 2.  Left upper lobe scarring, volume loss and secondary hyperexpansion of the
 left lower lobe.
