                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with squamous cell carcinoma of lung presenting with cough
 and axilla pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia or rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right port catheter is in expected and unaltered position.  Heart size is
 normal.  Again seen is paramediastinal fibrosis, likely secondary to prior
 radiation therapy.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Underlying
 emphysematous changes.  Again seen are hazy opacities in the right mid and
 lower lung, which may represent resolving pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Calcified right lower lobe granuloma best seen on the
 lateral view near the cardiophrenic angle.  No acute fractures.  Again seen
 are left posterolateral thoracotomy rib fractures.  Again seen are surgical
 clips in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared ___ and allowing for differences in technique, there is
 no significant interval change of the hazy opacities in the right mid and
 lower lung, which may represent resolving pneumonia.
 
 No evidence of interval worsening or acute rib fracture.
