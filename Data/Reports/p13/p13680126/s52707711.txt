 hematoma.  Careful followup is advised.  Small left pleural effusion is
 collected laterally in the left lower chest, a slight increase since
 yesterday.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left lower lung and right lung are
 essentially clear.  Heart size is normal.  There has been no progressive
 mediastinal widening.
