                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  for pre- op with upcoming prostate resection. Hx
 lung CA, COPD. Chest CT ___- Hx  left upper lobe partial resection.   Left
 lower lobe nodular opacities, unclear if represent infection, reassessment in
 3 months is recommended.   Post thoracotomy changes are stable.  New rib
 fracture is present on the left and might represent either pathological
 posttraumatic fracture.  Reassessment of this area in 3 months is recommended
 as well. Emphysema, unchanged.  Postradiation paramediastinal changes,
 unchanged.  // R/O new infiltrateR/O new infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation suggests COPD.  Patient has had left lung surgery, probably
 upper lobectomy.
 
 Hematoma at the site of the displaced left fifth rib fracture, laterally, is
 unchanged since ___.  Vague fracture of the left posterior seventh rib
 is also nonunited, but not appreciably displaced.  Although the lungs are
 clear on the frontal view, lateral view suggests an abnormality in one of the
 lower lobes projecting over the lowest visible thoracic vertebral body,
 possibly pneumonia.  If there is any clinical concern for pneumonia more
 radiographic documentation is needed, oblique views should be requested.
 
 Heart size normal.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Oblique views if there is clinical concern for pneumonia.
