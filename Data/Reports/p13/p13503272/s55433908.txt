                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with new onset epigastric abdominal pain, nausea and
 vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 Heart size is normal.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen projecting over
 right hemithorax, which appears intact throughout its course.  Additional
 catheter segments are seen in the left upper abdomen, better assessed on
 abdominal radiographs of the same date.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt appears intact throughout its course. 
 Additional shunt segments seen in the left upper abdomen are better assessed
 on dedicated abdominal radiographs of the same date.
