                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Positive PPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild left apical thickening.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; specifically no evidence of
 active tuberculosis.  Mild left apical thickening is nonspecific and may
 represent old granulomatous disease.
