                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hyperK  // ? mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded. A small opacity is seen in the right lung base,
 possibly representing atelectasis, but cannot exclude early pneumonia or
 aspiration in the right clinical setting.  Mild cephalization is noted, but no
 overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The mediastinum is widened, primarily due to an enlarged aorta, which could be
 aneurysmally dilated. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity in the right lung base, possibly representing atelectasis, but cannot
 exclude an early pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting.
 Recommend shallow oblique radiographs to further evaluate.
