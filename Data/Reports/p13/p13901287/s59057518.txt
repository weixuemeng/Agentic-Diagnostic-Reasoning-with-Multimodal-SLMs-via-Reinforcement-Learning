                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever from NH. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged and stable since prior.  There is mild enlargement of
 the mediastinal silhouette, likely secondary to a tortuous and dilated
 thoracic aorta, stable since prior.  There is also enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery which could reflect underlying pulmonary hypertension. There
 are tiny stable bilateral pleural effusions. Increased density at the upper
 lobes bilaterally and right lower lobe is felt to reflect scarring and
 fibrosis as was seen on prior chest CT. No definite new focal consolidation
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable tiny bilateral pleural effusions. Chronic changes related to scarring
 or fibrosis in the upper lobes bilaterally and right lower lobe. No new focal
 consolidation identified.
