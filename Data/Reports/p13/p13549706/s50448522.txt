                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Purulent drainage from sacral ulcer, fevers and
 altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities are re- demonstrated in the lung bases, not
 significantly changed in the interval, most likely reflective of atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. 
 Infection or aspiration is not completely excluded.
