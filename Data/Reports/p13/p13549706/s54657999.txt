                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Heart size is normal with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is
 present.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities possibly reflecting
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
