                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, cough  // acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles
 compatible with trace pleural effusions.  Low lung volumes accentuate vascular
 markings. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes as well as superimposed vascular markings.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis.
