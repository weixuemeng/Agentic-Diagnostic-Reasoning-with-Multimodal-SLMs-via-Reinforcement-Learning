                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with multiple myeloma, prior treatment for pneumonia. 
 Acute desaturation, volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left lower lobe is now completely collapsed with abrupt cut-off in distal left
 main stem, which is worrisome for aspiration.  The mediastinum is shifted
 towards the left.  Right lung is unremarkable except for minimal tiny
 atelectatic band in right lower lobe.  There is no pneumothorax, no
 significant pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Probable aspiration or mucus plugging with complete left lower lobe collapse
 and shift of mediastinum towards the left.  
 
 This was discussed with the medical team and the patient is feeling a lot
 better.  A chest x-ray followup has been suggested.
