                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with IgA MM, presenting for high-dose Cytoxan in
 preparation to auto-SCT, now with febrile neutropenia.  Study requested for
 evaluation of infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  At
 the lateral aspect of the left lung, it is difficult to discriminate between
 overlying soft tissue and a definite opacity within the left mid lung. The
 lungs are otherwise clear. The heart, mediastinum, hilum and pleura are
 normal.  Note is made of some heterogeneity along the ribs, however evaluation
 is limited in this single frontal radiograph. For a more thorough evaluation,
 conventional radiographs should be obtained.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overlying soft tissue along the lateral aspect of the left lung
 is difficult to discriminate from a definite left mid lung opacity. 
 Conventional radiographs should be considered if clinical concern is present.
