                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate pulmonary vasculature markings.  Patchy
 bilateral opacities in each lung with prominent interstitial component
 suggests multifocal pneumonia, although a heterogeneous pattern of pulmonary
 edema could also be considered.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is
 noted.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting either pneumonia or possibly mild pulmonary
 edema with a heterogeneous distribution.
