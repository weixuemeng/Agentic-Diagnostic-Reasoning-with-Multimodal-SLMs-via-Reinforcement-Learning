                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HIV with neutropenia and high fevers.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, on the lateral view there is
 some increased opacification in the retrocardiac region.  Although this could
 merely reflect atelectasis, in view of the clinical history, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  
 
 Remainder of the study is unchanged.
