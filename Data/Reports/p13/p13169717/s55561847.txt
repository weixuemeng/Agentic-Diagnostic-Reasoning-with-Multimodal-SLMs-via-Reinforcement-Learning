 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate hyperinflation of

 fourth rib on the right side is noted.  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Visualized osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute thoracic process.  Essentially normal chest
 radiograph.
