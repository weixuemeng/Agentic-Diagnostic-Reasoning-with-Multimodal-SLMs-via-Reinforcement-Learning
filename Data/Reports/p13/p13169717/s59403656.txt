                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with wheezing and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles is unchanged compared to prior examination and is likely secondary to
 chronic pleural thickening.  Post-surgical changes from prior rib resections
 from the right upper chest wall appear stable.  Adjacent mild right upper lobe
 pleural thickening is stable.  The lungs are clear without confluent
 consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process
