                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased secretions from her tracheostomy
 // Evidence of infection      Evidence of infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for differences in
 obliquity, there are lower lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Basilar
 opacifications probably reflect atelectasis and small effusions. However, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude.
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
