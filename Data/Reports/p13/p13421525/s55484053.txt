 INDICATION:  Dyspnea in a patient with a tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, with the tip

 by low lung volumes and patient positioning.  There is bibasilar atelectasis,
 without identification of a definite focal consolidation. No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Tracheostomy in appropriate position.
