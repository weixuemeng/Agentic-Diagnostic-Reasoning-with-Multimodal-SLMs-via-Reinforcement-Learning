                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or dilated bowel in a patient with a
 tracheostomy and PEG tube, presenting with vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  Evaluation is limited
 secondary to patient rotation.  A tracheostomy tube projects over the left
 upper lung.  The PEG tube is not well visualized on this exam.  There is no
 obvious focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No dilated
 loops of bowel are seen within the visualized abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study secondary to patient rotation.  Within these limitations, no
 definite focal consolidation or evidence of small bowel obstruction.
