                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Vomiting. Evaluate for pneumonia versus aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates the tracheostomy tube terminating
 approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged, although this may be in part due to projection. Calcifications of
 the aortic knob are again noted. Streaky opacities in the right base are
 consistent with atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is minimally better seen
 compared to ___.  Left base opacity may reflect atelectasis, although
 sequela of aspiration cannot be excluded.  No new focal consolidation
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, with minimally improved aeration of the left lower
 lobe. No new focal consolidation identified, although it is difficult to
 evaluate the left base, given the patient rotation and overlap by the cardiac
 silhouette over the left lower lobe.
