                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with vomiting
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with right hilar prominence again
 noted. Tracheostomy tube tip remains in unchanged position.  There is mild
 upper zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy left
 basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not
 excluded. A trace left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is
 identified. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen indicate prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis but infection
 or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. Probable trace
 left pleural effusion.
