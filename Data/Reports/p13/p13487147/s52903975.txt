                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient positioning and rotation. The
 patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size appears mildly
 enlarged.  Large hiatal hernia is again noted with adjacent left basilar
 atelectasis.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  No large
 pneumothorax is present, however, the left apex is obscured by the patient's
 chin and neck soft tissues projecting over this area.  Hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable allowing for patient rotation.  Lung volumes are low with
 mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.
 No focal consolidation is otherwise demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study.  Large hiatal hernia with adjacent left basilar atelectasis and
 possible small left pleural effusion.  Low lung volumes.
