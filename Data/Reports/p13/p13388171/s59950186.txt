                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph also from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer, assess for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PIC line in the left arm extends into the proximal SVC.  A right
 hilar mass is better assessed on prior CT.  There is stable enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, which is likely secondary to known pericardial effusion
 seen on prior CT.  No pleural effusion or definite signs of pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly which could reflect known pericardial
 effusion, better assessed on prior CT, with hilar mass, also better assessed
 previously.  No definite signs of superimposed pneumonia.
