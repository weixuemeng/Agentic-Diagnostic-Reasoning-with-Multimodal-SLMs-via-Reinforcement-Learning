                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF exacerbation // CVL positioning, e/o
 pulm edema or other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, ___, and multiple images from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged.  Again noted is mild central
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The previously seen right internal jugular
 sheath is no longer noted.  There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural
 effusion.  No consolidation is identified.  Increased conspicuity of opacity
 is seen at the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis, though
 consolidation is not excluded.
 
 An AICD is in appropriate, unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased prominence of right basilar opacity may represent developing
 consolidation.
