                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of decompensated CHF status post
 ICD placement.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pectoral ICD with a single lead terminating in the right ventricle. 
 Stable cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vessels appear less engorged, although this
 may simply reflect the differences between an upright PA film and a supine AP
 film instead of a true improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable versus slightly decreased pulmonary vascular congestion.
