                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with  right chest pain, reproducible on palpation. Evaluate
 for right anterior lower rib fracture or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart is
 top-normal in size.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  Lower ribs are incompletely evaluated
 due to underpenetration and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic process. Lower ribs are incompletely evaluated due to
 underpenetration and technique.  Dedicated rib series would be more sensitive
 for detection of rib fracture, if clinically indicated.
