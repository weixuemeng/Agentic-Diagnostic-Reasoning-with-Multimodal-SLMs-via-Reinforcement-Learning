                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 12:30 at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is somewhat rotated.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG,
 with the inferior-most sternal wire fractured.  The lung volumes are low,
 which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly stable with the cardiac silhouette enlarged.  There is
 mild prominence of the perihilar vascular structures which are likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes, however, underlying mild edema may be
 present. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, which likely accentuates the
 right perihilar structures, but infectious process is difficult to exclude. No
 large pleural effusions are seen.  There are no findings to suggest
 pneumothorax.    There is chronic-appearing deformity of the right shoulder. 
 Degenerative changes are also noted at the left shoulder.  Suggest followup
 radiograph with better inspiration if/when patient able.
