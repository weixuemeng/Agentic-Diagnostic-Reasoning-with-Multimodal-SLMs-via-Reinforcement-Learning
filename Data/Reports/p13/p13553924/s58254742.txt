                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever with history of CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better,
 though not large, inspiration.  Continued substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with relatively normal pulmonary vessels.  This raises the
 possibility of pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
