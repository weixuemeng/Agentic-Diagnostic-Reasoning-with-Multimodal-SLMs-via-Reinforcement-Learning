                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the engorgement of ill-defined
 pulmonary vessels has decreased, as has the size of the cardiac silhouette,
 all consistent with improved pulmonary vascular status.  Remainder of the
 examination is essentially unchanged.  Large mass displacing the lower
 cervical trachea to the left is again consistent with a thyroid abnormality.
