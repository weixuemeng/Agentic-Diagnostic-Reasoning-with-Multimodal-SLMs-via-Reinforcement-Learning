                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increase in
 ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with increasing pulmonary venous
 pressure.  There may be slight increase in the overall size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Again there is evidence of a large right-sided goiter with
 bilateral upper lobe scarring and scattered calcified granulomas.  Some
 atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
