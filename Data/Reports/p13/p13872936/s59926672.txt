                                 FINAL REPORT
 conceals major portion of the left-sided diaphragm.  The effusion extends into
 the posterior pleural sinuses as seen on the lateral view.  The amount of
 pleural effusion is considered to be moderate (approximately 500 cc).  The
 pleural density on the left side may have increased slightly in comparison to
 the left-sided findings on the previous chest examination.  On the other hand,
 the at that time existing right-sided pleural effusion has disappeared
 completely and the right lateral pleural sinus is free.  No pneumothorax on
 either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elimination of right-sided pleural effusion, but slight
 progression of left-sided pleural effusion.  Cause unknown.
