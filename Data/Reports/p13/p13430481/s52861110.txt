                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right pneumothorax after nerve block.  Question residual after chest
 tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, a right pigtail catheter is present overlying the right
 upper lung.  There is a small right pneumothorax.  Otherwise, no significant
 change is detected.  Again seen is background hyperinflation, prominent
 cardiomegaly, possible enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, upper zone
 redistribution, and patchy relatively confluent opacities at both lung bases,
 with minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles.  Incidental note made of
 findings consistent with chronic right rotator cuff tear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right chest tube with small right
 pneumothorax present.
