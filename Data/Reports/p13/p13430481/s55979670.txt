                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with lymphoma and pleural effusion, for interval
 assessment.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate left pleural effusion has reaccumulated with accompanying
 atelectasis resulting in retrocardiac opacity.  Smaller right pleural effusion
 is also seen with right-sided presumed pleural drainage catheter not well
 assessed.  The remainder of the lung is well expanded without pneumothorax. 
 Continued widening of the right and left paratracheal stripes, fullness in the
 AP window, and density in the subcarinal region is compatible with adenopathy
 which in total is not particularly improved since the prior studies. 
 Unchanged compression fractures are seen in the mid and lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Reaccumulated moderate left and trace right pleural effusions with
 extensive mediastinal adenopathy compatible with history of lymphoma without
 notable improvement. 
 
 2. Mid and lower thoracic compression fractures are unchanged.
