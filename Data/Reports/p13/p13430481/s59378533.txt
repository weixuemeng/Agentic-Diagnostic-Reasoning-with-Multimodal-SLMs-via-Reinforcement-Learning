                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleurx catheter placement on ___ complicated by PTX, now with chest
 tube.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___ at 21:00 p.m., there has been interval clearing of the
 left lung.  There is residual left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 likely with a small amount of left pleural fluid as well as increased opacity
 at the left base.  There is new small right effusion with patchy opacity at
 the right base.  Probable small right pneumothorax.  Prominent elongated right
 paratracheal opacity is unchanged and most likely relates to the patient's
 known lymphoma. 
 
 There is tubing overlying the right lung base for which clinical correlation
 is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION: Probable small right pneumothorax, consistent with provided
 history. New small right effusion, with patchy opacity at right base. Interval
 improvement in left lung opacities.
