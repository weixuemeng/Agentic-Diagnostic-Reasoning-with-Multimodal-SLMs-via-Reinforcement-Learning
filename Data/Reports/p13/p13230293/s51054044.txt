                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain status post EGD.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally. There is
 no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits. Biapical pleural thickening and nodularity
 is identified which appear symmetric. This is likely to reflect pleural
 parenchymal scarring. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized
 osseous structures demonstrate no acute abnormality. No free air under the
 right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No free air under the right hemidiaphragm. Biapical pleural thickening and
 nodularity likely reflective of pleural parenchymal scarring. If referable
 symptomatology exists, nonemergent Chest CT for further evaluation is
 recommended.
