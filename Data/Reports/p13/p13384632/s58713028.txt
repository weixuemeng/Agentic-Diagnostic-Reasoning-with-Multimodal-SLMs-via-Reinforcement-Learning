                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asymptomatic hypoxia after AV fistula thrombectomy. Evaluate for
 pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is mild pulmonary edema.
 There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
 right. Superimposed consolidation is seen in the left lung base and could
 reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.  A more nodular focal opacity overlying the
 left eighth rib may relate to the same process.
 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Opacity at the left lung base may represent atelectasis or infection.
 Followup after diuresis is recommended.
