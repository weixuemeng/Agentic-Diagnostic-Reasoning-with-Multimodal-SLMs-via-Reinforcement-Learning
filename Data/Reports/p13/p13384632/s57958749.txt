                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease with dyspnea. Evaluate for fluid
 overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. There is mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral
 pleural effusions. Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. There is no focal
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia though a nodular opacity projecting over
 the left lower lung is again noted which is thought to represent a focus of
 rounded atelectasis as stated on prior CT chest. No pneumothorax. Sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
