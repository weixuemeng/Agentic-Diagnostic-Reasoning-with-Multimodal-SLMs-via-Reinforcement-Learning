                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  Cough, chills
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged. Linear areas of scarring within the right middle and lower
 lobes compatible with prior regions of wedge resection are unchanged as is
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle appears to be chronic, likely related to scarring. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous
 abnormality detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
