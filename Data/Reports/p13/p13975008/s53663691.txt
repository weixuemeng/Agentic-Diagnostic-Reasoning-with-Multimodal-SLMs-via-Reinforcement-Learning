  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs, right greater than left. Some of
  this may be attributed to patient's known underlying cryptogenic organizing
  pneumonia. There is no Prior to evaluate for interval change to assess for
  active disease. Increased interstitial markings could also be attributed to
  degree of vascular congestion. Trace right effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with history of syncope additional history gathered. The ET
 dashboard reveals history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Breast cancer
 status post radiation therapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 There are increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs most confluent
 the right lung base. There is also suggestion of a small right-sided pleural
 effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but potentially in part due to
 prominent mediastinal fat and accentuated by AP technique. Deformities of the
 left lateral ribs compatible with old fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings in the lungs, right greater than left. Some of
 this may be attributed to patient's known underlying cryptogenic organizing
 pneumonia. There is no prior to evaluate for interval change. Right basilar
 opacity could certainly represent active disease or infection. Increased
 interstitial markings could also be attributed to degree of vascular
 congestion. Trace right effusion.
