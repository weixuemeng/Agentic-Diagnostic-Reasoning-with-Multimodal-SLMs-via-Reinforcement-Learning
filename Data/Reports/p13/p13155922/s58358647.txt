                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Multifocal
 predominantly linear areas of atelectasis are present in the mid and lower
 lungs bilaterally.  No focal areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.  Possible very small bilateral pleural effusions.  Note made of
 small effusions on prior CT of one week earlier.  Interval advancement of
 feeding tube, now extending at least within the duodenum, but not completely
 imaged on this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal atelectasis in the mid and lower lungs.  Possible very
 small effusions.
