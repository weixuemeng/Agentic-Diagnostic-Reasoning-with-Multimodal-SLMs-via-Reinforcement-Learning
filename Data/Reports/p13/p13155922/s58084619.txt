                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post stab wound to the abdomen status post
 exploratory laparotomy and new placement of Dobbhoff tube.  Evaluate for
 evidence of perforation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The Dobbhoff tube has been partially removed and its tip is just
 below the gastroesophageal junction.  Surgical ___ from exploratory
 laparotomy are redemonstrated.
 
 Otherwise, lung volumes are low.  Linear opacities across the left lower lobe
 represent segmental atelectasis.  There is also some retrocardiac atelectasis
 obscuring the margin of the left hemidiaphragm.  No other focal opacities are
 present.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 Although assessment of abdominal free air cannot be performed due to poor
 position, no secondary signs of free air are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube partially removed with the tip just passed the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis not significantly changed from prior. 
 
 Communicated by Dr ___ to Dr ___ on ___ at 4:40 pm via phone
