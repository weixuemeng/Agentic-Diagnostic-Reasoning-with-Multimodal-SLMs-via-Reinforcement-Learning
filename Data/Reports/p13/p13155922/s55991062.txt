 atelectasis.  There is no effusion or new consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous abnormality seen. 
 Surgical drain projects over left upper quadrant.  No free air seen below the

 however this is compatible with the configuration of patient's liver which is
 also underneath the left hemidiaphragm.
