                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality
 and fissural thickening, suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  Kerley B lines are
 noted along lateral costophrenic angles.  No focal opacities are visualized,
 however.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild congestive heart failure.
