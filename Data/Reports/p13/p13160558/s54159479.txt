 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema is detected.  Tiny nodular density projecting over the upper
 lung field on lateral view only is likely external to the patient as it is not
 seen on frontal view.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.
