                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening respiratory distress, concerning pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial
 progression of the already moderate pulmonary edema seen on the previous film.
 The edema is centralized in distribution and affects both the left and the
 right lung.  Extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions that are limited to
 the costophrenic areas, is constant.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with
 shape of the cardiac silhouette, potentially indicating a small pericardial
 effusion.  Unchanged position of the left pectoral pacemaker.
