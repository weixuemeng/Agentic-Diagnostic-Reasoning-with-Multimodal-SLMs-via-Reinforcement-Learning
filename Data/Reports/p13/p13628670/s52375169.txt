 AP CHEST, 8:18 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with flash pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. 
 Assess improvement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Sequence of changes starting ___, 2:15 p.m., showed rapidly worsening
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema over a six-hour period, mild improvement
 over the next 5 hours into ___, and continued mild improvement a little
 over a day later today.  Residual edema is asymmetric, favoring the right
 lung, but not so unbalanced as to raise concern about pneumonia, although of
 course it cannot be excluded.  Heart is normal size.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not substantial.  The transvenous right atrioventricular pacer
 leads are in standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax.
