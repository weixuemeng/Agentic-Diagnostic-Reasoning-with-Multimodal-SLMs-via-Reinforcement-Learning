                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  There are bilateral interstitial opacities
 with a perihilar distribution, with associated bilateral hilar engorgement and
 small pleural effusions.  Slightly increased right basial opacity is also
 seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from
 prior.  A bicameral pacemaker is re-identified with the leads in unchanged
 position.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.  Increased right
 basilar opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis, although
 infection cannot be excluded.
