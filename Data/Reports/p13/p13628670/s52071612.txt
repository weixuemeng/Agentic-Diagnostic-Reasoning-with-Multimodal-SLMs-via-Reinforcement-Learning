 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are multi focal regions of
 opacity specifically in the bilateral perihilar region and bilateral
 costophrenic angles, overall worse on the right compared to the left. 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may be due to small superimposed
 pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Dual lead pacing device is seen with leads in stable position.  Median
 sternotomy wires again noted.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications again seen
 at the aortic arch.  Probable calcified mediastinal nodes are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities and small effusions may be due to pulmonary
 edema.  Alternatively this could be from atypical infection.  Clinical
 correlation suggested.
