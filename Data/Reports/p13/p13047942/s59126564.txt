                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right fifth toe ulcer.  Preop surgery.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle. 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, though there is also suggestion of background
 COPD.  There is a mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration. 
 The aorta is calcified.  Right paratracheal soft tissues likely reflect
 vascular ectasia.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. 
 There is atelectasis and/or scarring at both lung bases, similar to the prior
 film.  I suspect the presence of a faint focal density in the left upper zone,
 which in retrospect is unchanged.  This is focal, but relatively ill-defined,
 measuring approximately 23 mm.  There is minimal  atelectasis or scarring at
 the right base laterally.  No gross effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 A vertical linear lucency projects over the proximal diaphysis of the right
 humerus.  In the absence of concern for pathology in this area, this likely
 represents some form of artifact related to overlying fat folds.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Doubt acute pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Probable COPD and probable cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 4.  Atelectasis and/or scarring at the lung bases.
 
 5.  A focal 23 mm ill-defined opacity in the left upper zone, similar to
 ___.  Consider further evaluation with chest CT on a nonurgent basis, to
 exclude a focal opacity or nodule.
