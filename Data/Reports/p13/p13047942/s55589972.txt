                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette and a pacer device in place.  Opacification at the right base
 medially persists with some obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.  Although this
 could merely reflect crowding of vessels, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 a developing pneumonia would have to be considered.
