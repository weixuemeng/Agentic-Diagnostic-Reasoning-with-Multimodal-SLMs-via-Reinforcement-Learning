                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for line placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates right internal jugular central
 venous catheter tip projecting over mid SVC.  Dual-chamber pacemaker leads are
 in unchanged position.  Lung volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular
 markings.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Left costophrenic
 angle is blunted, suggestive of possible small pleural effusion.  There is no
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  Left
 atrium is prominent.  Heavy aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Bibasilar
 opacities are likely atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over mid SVC.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular congestion and likely small left
 pleural effusion.
