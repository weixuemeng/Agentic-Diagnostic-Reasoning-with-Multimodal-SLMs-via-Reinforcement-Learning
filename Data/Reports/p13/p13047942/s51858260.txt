                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease, AFib, here with hypotension. 
 Please rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ most recently, dating back
 to ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.  There is a right-sided IJ
 which terminates in the mid SVC.  There is a left-sided pacemaker.  Again
 opacification of the right base medially persists with some obscuration of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  This could reflect merely crowding of vessels; however,
 pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  This,
 however, appears overall stable compared to the prior exam.  Again seen is
 bibasilar atelectasis as well as a small right pleural effusion. There is mild
 right pulmonary edema. The hilar and mediastinal contours appear stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Opacification at the medial right lung base overall stable compared to the
 prior exam. This may reflect crowding of vessels however an infectious process
 should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Mild right pulmonary edema.
