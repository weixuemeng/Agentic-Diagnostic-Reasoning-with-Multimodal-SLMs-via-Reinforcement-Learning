                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall while on Coumadin.  Evaluate for bleeding.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal lateral views of the chest.  The lung volumes are low, which
 accentuates the bronchovascular structures.  Additionally, fine details
 obscured by overlying soft tissue.  Within these limitations, there is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Linear
 atelectasis is seen anteriorly on the lateral view.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains moderately enlarged.  The hilar structures and mediastinum are
 unremarkable.  Calcifications are noted within the aortic arch.  A left-sided
 pacemaker is unchanged in orientation.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
