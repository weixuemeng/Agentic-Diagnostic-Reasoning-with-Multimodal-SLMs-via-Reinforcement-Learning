                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cardiac arrest  // Eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.3 cm from the carina.  Mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present.  Aortic knob calcifications
 are visualized.  Lung volumes are low with widening of the superior
 mediastinal contour which may be due to low lung volumes and supine AP
 technique.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Airspace opacification in
 the left lung base is concerning for atelectasis or infection along with a
 small left pleural effusion.  No large pneumothorax is present.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube.
 2. Left basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis or infection along with
 a small left pleural effusion.
 3. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is likely due to a combination
 of low lung volumes, supine positioning and AP technique.  If there is concern
 for vascular abnormality, CT of the chest is recommended for further
 assessment.
