                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with extensive cardiac history acute chest pain
 // widened mediastinum? pneumo? pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the
 cardiac silhouette.  There is moderate retrocardiac opacity.  There may be a
 small left effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.
 Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes,
 patient positioning, and AP technique.
 2. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
 3. Retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis, but in the appropriate
 clinical setting, infection could be a possibility.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiographs with a true symmetric frontal view are
 recommended.
