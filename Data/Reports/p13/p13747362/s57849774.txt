                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP single chest view was compared with prior chest
 radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the
 stomach, but its distal end is beyond the radiograph view.  The extent of
 bilateral pectoral gas inclusions is unchanged. Mild right apical pneumothorax
 is stable. Bilateral pleural effusions and lower lung atelectases are
 unchanged.  Due to gross rotation of the patient, assessment of
 cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited.  Due to the same reason, assessment
 of monitoring and supporting devices was limited.
