                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:55
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post ascending aorta replacement,
 clamping of chest tube, evaluate right pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 7:22 and
 ___ at 19:47.
 
 Single portable AP upright chest film ___ at 9:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Single-lead right-sided pacemaker is unchanged in position.  Right
 internal jugular introducer catheter and feeding tube are also likely
 unchanged, although the tip of the feeding tube cannot be definitively
 identified.  No definite chest tube is seen.  However, the right apical
 pneumothorax does not appear to be changed.  Persistent bibasilar patchy
 opacities with more focal consolidation in the retrocardiac area and
 associated pleural effusions are also stable and likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall, stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours status
 post median sternotomy.
