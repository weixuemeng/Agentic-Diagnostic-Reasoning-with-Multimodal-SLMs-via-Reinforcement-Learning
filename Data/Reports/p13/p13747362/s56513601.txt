                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post ascending aortic
 replacement, chest tubes on water seal.  No air leak.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained four hours earlier during the
 same day.  The position of the ETT is unchanged and symmetrical within the
 lumen of the trachea.  The tube terminates just above the previously described
 left-sided impression on the trachea caused by the now operated aneurysm. 
 Postoperative widening of the superior mediastinum is unchanged during the
 latest four hours.  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn but the right
 internal jugular sheath remains in position.  There is now a small right-sided
 apical pneumothorax measuring up to 2 cm in width.  When reviewing the same
 area on the preceding examination four hours ago, such pneumothorax was not
 present.  On the other hand, evidence of bilateral air inclusion in Bibasilar
 hazy densities and obliteration of the diaphragmatic the pectoralis muscle
 structures is again noted as before.  contours is suggestive of bilateral
 pleural effusion.  The latter finding appears to be stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of small right apical pneumothorax possibly related
 to Swan-Ganz removal and the remaining sheath.  ___ was informed by
 telephone.
