                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM ___ AT 8:05 P.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new NJ tube post-pyloric.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 14:48.
 
 A single portable AP upper chest film ___ at 8:05 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right-sided pacemaker remains in place and unchanged.  A right internal
 jugular introducer catheter has its tip near the junction of the internal
 jugular with the superior vena cava.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach in the left upper
 quadrant.  
 
 2. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with persistent
 enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Extensive bilateral subcutaneous
 emphysema, with a persistent small right apical pneumothorax which is likely
 unchanged given differences in positioning.  There are increasing layering
 small pleural effusions and increasing indistinctness of the perihilar
 vasculature, which likely reflects mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity
 most likely reflects compressive atelectasis rather than pneumonia given the
 presence of the pleural effusion.
