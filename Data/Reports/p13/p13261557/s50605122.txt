                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with port  // assess port placement      assess
 port placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the Port-A-Cath is in the
 upper to mid SVC.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening
 hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  No acute focal
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 There is vague suggestion of some nodular opacifications at the bases,
 especially on the right, which was seen to much better advantage on a prior CT
 scan.
