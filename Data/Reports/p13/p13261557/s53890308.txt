                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Productive cough and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear stable.  The chest is hyperinflated.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The interstitium is mildly
 prominent with peribronchial cuffing.  Sclerosis along left anterior lateral
 first and second ribs is suggestive of prior fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial abnormality.  Airway inflammation or mild fluid overload
 could be considered as potential etiologies.
