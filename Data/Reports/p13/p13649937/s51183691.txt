 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:38 PM
  Right PICC cannot be visualized beyond the uppermost portion of the SVC
  secondary to superimposed mediastinal structures.  Left perihilar and left
  basilar opacities are not signficantly changed, likely a combination of
  pneumonia and atelectasis.  Increased right basilar opacities could be new or
  worsening pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion could be slightly increased.
