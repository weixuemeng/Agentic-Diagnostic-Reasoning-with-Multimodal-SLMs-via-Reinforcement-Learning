                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sudden blindness, possible temporal
 arteritis, starting steroids  // assess for infx
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size and the aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 Lungs are well-expanded and clear except for a nonspecific patchy opacity at
 the right lung base, which may be due to focal atelectasis, aspiration, and
 less likely an early focus of infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
