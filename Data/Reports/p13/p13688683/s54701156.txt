                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of chronic heart failure, ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has been intubated.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects above the carina.  The tube should
 be pulled back by approximately 2 cm.  The left internal jugular vein catheter
 shows a normal course.  The tip positioned relatively high in the superior
 vena cava.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Unchanged
 position of the aortic valve replacement.  Newly appeared retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  In addition, there is a zone of increased opacity at the left
 lung base, potentially reflecting the left border of the moderately enlarged
 cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
