                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left pneumothorax status post PleurX
 catheter insertion.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 persistence of a small left-sided apical pneumothorax.  There has been
 interval resolution of the previously seen hypodensity at the left lateral
 chest wall, now this region is homogeneously opaque, and may represent
 reaccumulation of pleural fluid.  Stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in
 the right lung may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor.
 Status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small left-sided apical pneumothorax and resolution of
 hypodensity at the left lateral chest wall may suggest reaccumulation of
 fluid.
 
 COMMENTS: These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone at 11:00am on ___, 15 minutes after their discovery.
