                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with persistent cough after breast radiation
 therapy, rule out infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Very mild
 interstitial pulmonary abnormality and bronchial wall thickening could be due
 to prior episodes of congestive heart failure, but possibility of bronchitis,
 particularly in the right lower lobe is raised.  There are no findings to
 suggest pneumonia.  Hazy opacification surrounding the left hilus could be
 early radiation effect.  The heart is normal size, despite very heavy
 calcification of the mitral annulus, which sometimes leads to mitral
 regurgitation.  Currently, there is no edema or pleural effusion.
