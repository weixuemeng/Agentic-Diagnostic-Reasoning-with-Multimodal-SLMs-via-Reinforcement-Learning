                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with metastatic lung cancer status post placement
 of left PleurX catheter.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement
 of a left-sided PleurX catheter.  There has been interval decrease in
 left-sided pleural effusion.  In the apex and lateral left chest wall, there
 are areas of increased lucency, which may represent a pneumothorax versus
 expanded lung.  Stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung
 may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor.  Again seen is a
 discrete metastatic mass in the right upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post-placement of left PleurX catheter with interval
 decrease in left-sided pleural effusion.  Left-sided apical and lateral areas
 of hypodensity may represent pneumothorax versus expanding lung.  Recommend
 repeat radiograph of the chest for additional evaluation of possible
 pneumothorax.
