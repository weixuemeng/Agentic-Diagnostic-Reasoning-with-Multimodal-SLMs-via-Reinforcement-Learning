                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumothorax.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small
 residual pneumothorax at the left lung apex and small areas of minimal
 aeration throughout the left hemithorax.  There is dense consolidation of the
 left lung with an indeterminate amount of pleural effusion on the left side. 
 There is a stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung which
 again may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor.  Again seen
 is a discrete metastatic mass in the right upper lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent small left-sided apical pneumothorax with small areas of
 minimally aerated left lung.
 
 2.  Dense consolidation of the left lung with indeterminate amount of pleural
 effusion.  Lateral radiograph of the chest would assist in determining the
 degree of pleural effusion present, if patient's condition would allow.
