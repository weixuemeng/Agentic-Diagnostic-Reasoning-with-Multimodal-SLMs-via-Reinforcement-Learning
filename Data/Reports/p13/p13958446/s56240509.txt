                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with incidental lung mass, now with new shortness of breath and
 leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pulmonary edema
 has worsened.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Some blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle and poor definition of the hemidiaphragm may
 reflect small effusion with compressive atelectasis.
 
 Central catheter tip is difficult to see but appears to be further than on the
 previous study.
