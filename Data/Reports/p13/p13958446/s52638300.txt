 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ as well as more recent
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
 aortic valve replacement.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a persistent left basilar opacity suggesting scarring
 associated with prior surgery.  This is also a mild new interstitial
 abnormality suggesting mild fluid overload, although otherwise the lungs
 appear clear.  Mild right lateral pleural thickening is unchanged.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
