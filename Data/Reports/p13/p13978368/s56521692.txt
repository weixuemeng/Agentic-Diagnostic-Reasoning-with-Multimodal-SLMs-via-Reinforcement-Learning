 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:49 PM
  Changes in the right lung, including pleural thickening and diffuse hazy
  opacification with chain sutures projecting over the right upper lobe, are
  consistent with known malignancy. Opacification seens to have progressed,
  which may reflect worsening malignancy or superimposed process such as
  infection. Left lung essentially clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged as well as the appearance of
 the right upper lung.  The right upper lobe consolidation with a central
 fiducial  seen on ___, can be still demonstrated on the current
 examination and difficult to compare with previous study, although appears to
 be potentially minimally decreased.   Overall, no substantial progression of
 the findings as compared to prior studies demonstrated.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax seen.
