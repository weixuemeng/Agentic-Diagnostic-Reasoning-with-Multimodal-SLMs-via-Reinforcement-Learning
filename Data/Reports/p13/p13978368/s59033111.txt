                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  In this patient
 with known metastatic disease to the right hemithorax, there is overall no
 significant interval change in appearance of vague opacity within the right
 mid lung, right lung apex and right lung base, with suture material again
 noted projecting over the right upper lung.  These findings are overall stable
 and likely reflect unchanged metastatic disease.  The left lung remains clear.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity within the right hemithorax is overall stable and
 compatible with known metastatic disease.  No evidence of new consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
