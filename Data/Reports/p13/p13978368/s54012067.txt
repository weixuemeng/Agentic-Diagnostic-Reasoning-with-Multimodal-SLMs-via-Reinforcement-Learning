                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with lung cancer and respiratory distress. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___. 
 Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Multiple patchy opacities throughout
 the right lung are compatible with known pleural metastasis.  Chain sutures in
 the right upper lung are re-demonstrated, consistent with prior wedge
 resection. A focal nodularity seen in the left apex was compared with prior CT
 and corresponds to a focus of fibrosis/scarring. No focal opacities are seen
 in the right lung concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiac size is normal.  There is
 a tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic wall,
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An IVC filter is
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with pleural-based right lung metastasis have
 not significantly changed compared with prior exam.  No new focal opacities
 suggestive of pneumonia.
