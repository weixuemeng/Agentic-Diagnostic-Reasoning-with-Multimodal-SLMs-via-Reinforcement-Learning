                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, prior pulmonary embolism with stage IV
 non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour appears
 unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Volume loss in
 the right lung with surgical chain sutures are again seen within the right
 upper lobe.  Right-sided pleural thickening, along with right hilar
 enlargement and hazy opacification in the right lung, particularly the
 superior segment of the right lower lobe are re- demonstrated, compatible with
 known malignancy.  Overall, the degree of opacification within the right
 hemithorax, particularly the right perihilar region appears slightly increased
 compared to the previous exam.  Left lung is clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Partially imaged is an inferior vena cava filter within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval increase in vague right perihilar opacification, possibly
 reflecting disease progression, infection, or asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Right hilar mass, right pleural thickening and hazy opacification within the
 right lung are otherwise compatible with known malignancy.
