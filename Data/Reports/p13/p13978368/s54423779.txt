                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Additional history of
 lung cancer from prior radiology reports.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP view of the chest.  There is increased opacity projecting over the right
 hemithorax some of which is pleural-based and compatible with known pleural
 metastases.  Postoperative changes in the right suprahilar region are again
 seen.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle potentially due to
 pleural mets versus underlying effusion, not significantly changed.  On the
 left, there is persistent opacity projecting over the left 1st rib compatible
 with region of consolidation on prior CT.  There is definite no definite new
 region of consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No acute
 osseous abnormality detected.  Osseous metastases better seen on prior CT
 involving the right ribs.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Findings again compatible with the right pleural based metastatic disease and
 left apical region of consolidation.  No definite superimposed acute process
 noting limitation of plain film for detection of subtle change.
