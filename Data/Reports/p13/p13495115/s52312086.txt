                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, chest CT from ___ and concurrent chest CT from the same day.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Complete evaluation is limited due to
 significant patient rotation.  Evaluation of the lung apices is also limited
 due to overlying patient's chin.  There are bibasilar consolidations which
 have increased since the prior chest radiograph since ___ and are better
 characterized on concurrent chest CT.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are difficult to evaluate due to
 bibasilar opacities and patient rotation.  Deformity of the thoracic cage due
 to old healed rib fractures is noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing bibasilar opacities better characterized on concurrent
 CT and likely due to progression of interstitial lung disease.  Please see
 concurrent chest CT report for details.
