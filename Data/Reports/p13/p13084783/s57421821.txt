                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with left lateral rib pain over
 a month ago.  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None listed.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest.   There is vague opacity projecting over
 the right lung apex.  In addition, there is thickening along the right pleura
 at the anterior junction line.  Overall this is suggestive of pleural-based
 disease.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable without visualized displaced
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Vague opacity projecting over the right upper lung, likely pleural-based, for
 which CT scan should be performed unless old films become available to
 document stability.
