                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and hemoptysis with history of sarcoidosis.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The previously described right
 upper lobe and lingular nodules continue to decrease in prominence.  There is
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  An equivocal nodule
 is seen overlying the left upper lobe on the frontal view.  The heart is
 normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Continued decrease in conspicuity of the
 right upper lobe and lingular nodules.  
 
 Equivocal left upper lobe nodule can be assessed by shallow oblique
 radiographs on a non-emergent basis.
