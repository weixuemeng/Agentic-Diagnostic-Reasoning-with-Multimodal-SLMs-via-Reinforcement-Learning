                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, dyspnea,
 recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Patchy right
 upper lobe opacity is seen.  No priors available for comparison to assess for
 interval change in this patient with reported recent history of pneumonia. 
 The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable, albeit the hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right upper lobe opacity in a patient of this age is more
 worrisome for pneumonia as opposed to underlying lesion.  No prior is
 available for comparison to assess for interval change.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, tuberculosis is not excluded.
