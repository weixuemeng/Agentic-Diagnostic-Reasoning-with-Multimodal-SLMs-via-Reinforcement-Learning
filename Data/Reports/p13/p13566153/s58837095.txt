                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Significant hemoptysis status post CT-guided biopsy of
 right upper lobe lesion.
 
 CHEST:  There are low lung volumes, particularly on the right, which is
 associated with a right pleural effusion.  The right upper nodule is now
 hazier, consistent with post-biopsy state.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Allowing for the differences in lung expansion, the left lung remains
 unchanged.
