                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and central pulmonary
 arteries remain prominent, in keeping with the history of sickle cell disease.
 Chronic linear scarring is present at the lung bases, and new subtle areas of
 reticulation are identified in the periphery of the upper-to-mid lung regions
 bilaterally.  Additionally, on the lateral radiograph, there is apparent lower
 lobe bronchial wall thickening as well as subtle increased opacity overlying
 the lower thoracic spine.  There is also suggestion of small bilateral pleural
 effusions with slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 bilaterally, new from the prior study. Skeletal structures appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar bronchial wall thickening and subtle lung opacities, which could
 potentially represent a developing bronchopneumonia.  Followup chest
 radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
 2.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
