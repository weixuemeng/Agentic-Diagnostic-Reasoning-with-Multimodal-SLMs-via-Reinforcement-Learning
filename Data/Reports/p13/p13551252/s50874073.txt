                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with distended abdomen,  nausea, vomiting , no bowel
 movement, history of aspiration pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:07
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and the patient's head and chin
 obscuring assessment of the lung apices, more so on the right.  Heart size
 appears unchanged, and top-normal.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 chronic with streaky opacity in the right lung base compatible with
 atelectasis.  No gross focal consolidation, pleural effusion or large
 pneumothorax is identified, but assessment again is limited.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is seen in the left upper
 abdomen.  Diffuse gaseous distension of bowel loops are seen in the upper
 abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited assessment due to patient positioning, particularly of the lung
 apices, more so on the right.  Right basilar atelectasis with chronic right
 hemidiaphragmatic elevation.  No other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 grossly identified.  Diffuse gaseous distention of bowel loops in the upper
 abdomen.
