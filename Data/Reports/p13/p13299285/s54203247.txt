                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup cardiac surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been removed.  Patient has taken a slightly better inspiration.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests pleural fluid, and
 opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with some residual
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
