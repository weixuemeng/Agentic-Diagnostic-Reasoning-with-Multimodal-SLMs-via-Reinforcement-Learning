                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man now postoperative day 2 status post right
 hepatectomy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires intact and aligned.  Right Port-A-Cath ends at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Interval extubation.  New opacity at the right base may
 reflect aspiration pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Left lung is
 clear.  Possible mediastinal widening may reflect venous distension and volume
 overload.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacity at the right base may reflect aspiration pneumonia or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema and warrants radiographic follow-up to ensure clearance.
 Possible, mild volume overload.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest radiograph to ensure clearance of new,
 right basilar opacity.
