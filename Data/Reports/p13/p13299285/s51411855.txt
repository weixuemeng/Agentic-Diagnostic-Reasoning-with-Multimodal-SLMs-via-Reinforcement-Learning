                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath after ERCP.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___
 obtained earlier. 
 
 There is interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema as well as more
 focused opacity in the left mid and lower lung, highly concerning for
 aspiration.  Developing infection would be less likely given the rapidity of
 the changes.  Assessment of the patient after diuresis is recommended.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Apical thickening
 involving left apex more than right is corresponding to an area of scarring
 bilaterally and potentially might reflect even post-radiation changes, please
 correlate clinically.
