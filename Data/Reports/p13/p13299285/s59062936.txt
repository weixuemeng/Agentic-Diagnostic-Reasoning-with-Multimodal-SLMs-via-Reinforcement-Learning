                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilat pleural effusions, R chest pigtail. 
 Please eval for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasoenteric tube is coiled in the stomach.  Right pigtail catheter is
 unchanged in position.  Small right apical pneumothorax appears similar. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged, although better delineation of the left
 hemidiaphragm suggests interval re-expansion of the left lung.  A left
 internal jugular central venous catheter is at the level of the lower SVC. 
 Right Port-A-Cath catheter is in the proximal right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Grossly unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Better delineation of the left hemidiaphragm suggests interval
 re-expansion of the left lung.
