                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient status post ERCP with leukocytosis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT chest, ___.
 
 There is new vascular congestion.  Left lower lobe opacities are likely
 atelectases, though superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.  Biapical fibrosis is better seen in
 prior CT.  Subpleural peripheral opacity in the right mid lung could be due to
 atelectasis or aspiration.  There are multiple areas of linear atelectases in
 bilateral lungs.
