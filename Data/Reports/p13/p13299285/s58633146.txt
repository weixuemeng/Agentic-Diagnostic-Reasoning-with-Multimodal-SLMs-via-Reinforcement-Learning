                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post right-sided thoracentesis.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternotomy wires are unchanged.  A left-sided PICC tip terminates
 at the lower SVC.  The course of the PICC projects over the aortic knob and
 has a slightly atypical course as it extends more centrally.  Otherwise, the
 heart size is normal.  The lungs are clear of consolidation.  The previously
 described pulmonary edema has improved.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of pneumothorax and improving pulmonary edema.
 2. Left PICC course likely within normal limits; if clinical concern for an
 intra-arterial line exists, correlate with pulsatility of flow or an ABG.
