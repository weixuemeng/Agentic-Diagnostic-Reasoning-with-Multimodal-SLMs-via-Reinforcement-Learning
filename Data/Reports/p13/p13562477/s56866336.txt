                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status with history of seizures, evaluate for
 infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable frontal chest x-ray demonstrates no acute
 intrathoracic process.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles with fluid seen in
 the minor fissure represents trace bilateral pleural effusions which are
 unchanged from prior study.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with stable
 left ventricular predominance.  Calcifications are again noted within the
 aortic arch, as are clips within the left neck.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable tiny bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged from prior. 
 No acute intrathoracic process.
