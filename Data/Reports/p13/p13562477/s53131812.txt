                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with crackles at the bases, question fluid
 overload.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with a left
 ventricular prominence suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy.  Lungs are
 clear without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, left greater
 than right, which likely reflects a combination of pleural thickening and/or
 fluid.  This is essentially stable.  Clips in the left lateral neck are again
 seen.  Interval removal of the Dobbhoff feeding tube.  Calcification of the
 aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  Stable thoracolumbar curvature with
 associated degenerative changes.  No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
