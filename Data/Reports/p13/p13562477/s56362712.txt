                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Seizure disorder, pulmonary edema, assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 6 hours earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm likely in the stomach.  ET tube
 tip is in the standard position 3.9 cm above the carina.  Left PICC tip is in
 the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate-to-large right and
 small-to- moderate left pleural effusion are grossly unchanged allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged and there is mild vascular congestion.
