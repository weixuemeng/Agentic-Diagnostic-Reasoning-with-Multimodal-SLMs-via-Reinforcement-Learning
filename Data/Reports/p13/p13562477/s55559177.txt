                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To evaluate placement and position of the Dobhoff tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable chest view was read in comparison with the
 most recent radiograph done on the same day approximately 8 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A Dobhoff tube is coiled in the hypopharynx and its distal end is looped in
 the stomach.  Consider repositioning the Dobhoff tube.  Mild pleural effusion
 on the right side and mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. 
 Given the low lung volumes, presence of mild pulmonary edema may be
 exaggerated.  Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart size and widened mediastinal
 contour is unchanged since at least ___.  There is retrocardiac
 density in the left lower lung reflecting  atelectasis is similar. There is a
 left-sided PICC line, with its tip in the subclavian vein, unchanged since at
 least ___.
