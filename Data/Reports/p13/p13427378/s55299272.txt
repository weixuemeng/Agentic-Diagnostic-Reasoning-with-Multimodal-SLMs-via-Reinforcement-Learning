                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINIDNGS:  The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal size.  Hilar
 fullness and indistinctness of vasculature suggest mild venous hypertension or
 congestion, but otherwise the lungs appear clear within the limitations of
 technique.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary congestion.
