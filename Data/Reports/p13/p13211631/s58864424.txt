                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Lung volumes are slightly low which accentuates
 the bronchovascular markings.  Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases
 could reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting
 atelectasis.
