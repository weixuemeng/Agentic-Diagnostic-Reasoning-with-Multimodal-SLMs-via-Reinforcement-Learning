                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Apparent
 concavity of the inferior aspect of the left mainstem bronchus may represent
 superimposed structures, but cannot exclude an endobronchial lesion. Lungs are
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.  Incidental note is
 made of bifid right eighth rib fused with the seventh rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia. Question of left mainstem endobronchial
 lesion versus superimposed structures. Could be further evaluated with
 slightly overpenetrated shallow obliques. Please have radiologist review prior
 to discharging patient.
