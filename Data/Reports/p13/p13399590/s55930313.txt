                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 heart and mediastinal contours are normal.  An area of calcification
 projecting over the lower thoracic spine likely is a intervertebral body disc
 at this level.  Bony structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings in the chest.
