 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and seizure. 
 Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained.  The lung
 apices are excluded on this study and overlying trauma board prevents detailed
 evaluation of the chest.  The heart size and bronchovascular markings are
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation is present.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The endotracheal tube terminates 7 mm from
 the carina.  NG tube terminates with side port in the stomach and its tip to
 the right of the midline.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates 7 mm from the carina.  NG tube is in
 appropriate position.  Low lung volumes.
