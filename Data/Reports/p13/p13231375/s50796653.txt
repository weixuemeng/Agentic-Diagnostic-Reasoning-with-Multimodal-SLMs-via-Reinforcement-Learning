                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history of blunt trauma and sternal fracture. 
 Other rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes exaggerate mild cardiomegaly and crowding of lower lobe
 vasculature.  Lungs are grossly clear.  I see no displaced rib fractures. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Sternal assessment would
 require dedicated sternal imaging either with conventional radiography or
 chest CT scanning.
