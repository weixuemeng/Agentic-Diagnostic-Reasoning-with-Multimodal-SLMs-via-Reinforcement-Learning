                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement with sternal drainage, assessment for broken wires.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest were reviewed.
 
 The post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable in appearance.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, grossly
 unchanged.  Post-radiation changes in the right upper lobe are redemonstrated
 as well as multiple surgical clips in the left axilla.  The left clavicle
 hardware, degenerative changes in the left shoulder are noted.  Overall, no
 substantial abnormality within the limitations of the chest radiograph is seen
 to explain the described drainage.
