  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are likely similar in size compared to
  the study from 4 hr ago, allowing for differences in patient positioning.  The
  right apical opacity is not significantly changed, likely related to pleural
  fluid.  No pneumothorax.  Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position.
