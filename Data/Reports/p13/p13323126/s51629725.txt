                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valvular
 surgery.  Interval slight decrease in size of cardiomediastinal contours and
 improved pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Abnormalities at the right lung apex
 are present including a poorly defined nodule adjacent to fiducial seeds
 corresponding to the patient's known lung cancer site, as well as apicolateral
 pleural thickening.  Adjacent post-treatment changes are present as well as
 mild associated right upper lobe volume loss.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions appear similar to the recent chest radiograph, and there is no
 visible pneumothorax.
