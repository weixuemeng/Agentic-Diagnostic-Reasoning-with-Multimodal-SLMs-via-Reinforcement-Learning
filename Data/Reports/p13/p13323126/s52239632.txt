                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart failure status post AV valve replacement.  Evaluate ET tube in
 position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs 11:00 today and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina.  A right-sided PICC
 terminates in the mid to lower SVC.  Left clavicular hardware, sternotomy
 wires and left axillary clips are constant.  Fiducial markers demarcate the
 known right upper lobe mass.  
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged with overlying atelectasis.
 Distal airways are still difficult to visualize which raises the concern for
 mucous impaction.  If the patient is still not improving, bronchoscopy should
 be considered.
 
 There is slight increase in mild pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess but top normal.  There is a postoperative appearance to the
 mediastinum.  Opacity of the right lung apex is likely pleural fluid and
 attention on follow up will suffice.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ ___ by Dr. ___ at 16:15 on
 ___ by telephone at time of discovery.
