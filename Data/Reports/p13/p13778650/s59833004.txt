                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post fall, right leg swelling, left knee
 pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by the AP technique and low
 lung volumes, but is proabaly mildly enlarged.  Increased bibasilar
 opacification is most compatible with atelectasis.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic sulci on the lateral view likely represents small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Old right rib fracture and
 tracheostomy tube noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes resulting in pulmonary vascular crowding and basilar
 atelectasis.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Mild cardiomegaly.
