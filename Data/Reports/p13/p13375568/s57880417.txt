                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening cirrhosis.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Bilateral, right more than left, pleural effusion is demonstrated,
 moderate-to-large on the right and most likely small on the left, increased
 since the prior study.  The elevated right hemidiaphragm most likely reflects
 a combination of pleural effusion and ascites.  Right middle lobe atelectasis
 is noted.  Lungs are otherwise essentially clear.  No change in the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrated.
