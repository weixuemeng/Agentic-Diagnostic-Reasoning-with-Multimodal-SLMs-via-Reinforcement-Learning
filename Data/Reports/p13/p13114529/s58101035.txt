                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The contour of
 the main pulmonary artery is moderately prominent.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Borderline cardiomegaly and enlarged main pulmonary artery
 contour, although with little if any change.  Sometimes this appearance can
 represent a normal variant but the possibility of pathology including
 pulmonary arterial hypertension cannot be excluded.
