                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock of unknown source, worsening
 respiratory status after fluid resuscitation  // Evaluate for edema/congestion
 vs. blooming PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  Background hyperinflation/COPD again noted.
 
 The right IJ central line is similar in configuration.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions, which are new compared with
 earlier the same day.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Increased retrocardiac
 density has progressed slightly the possibility of left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.
 
 There is mild prominence of the lower zone vessels, but no upper zone
 redistribution or mid zone peripheral vascular plethora.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small bilateral effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.  Increased
 retrocardiac density could reflect left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 Mild vascular prominence the lower zones is similar to prior.  No upper zone
 or peripheral vascular plethora is seen.
