  Interval placement of a central venous catheter which likely terminates in the
  proximal ascending aorta.  If confirmation is desired, repeat PA and lateral
  radiographs could be obtained.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever and hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AP and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter. 
 This catheter courses more midline than would be expected for the superior
 vena cava and projects over the ascending aorta straightening question of
 arterial placement.
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded, but grossly clear.  Biapical scarring and right
 hilar retraction are again noted, with together with slight tenting of the
 right hemidiaphragm.  No gross pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  The left
 lung base lies at the edge of the film is not well visualized.  The
 possibility of a small effusion and atelectasis at the left base would be
 difficult to exclude on this view.  The heart is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter.  The atypical
 course raises the possibility that this terminates in the proximal ascending
 aorta.  The differential could be that the line lies in the SVC and the
 patient is rotated, creating an artifactual appearance of an arterial line. 
 If confirmation is desired, repeat PA and lateral radiographs could be
 obtained.
 
 Limited visualization of the extreme left lung base.  Possibility of a small
 effusion and atelectasis at the left lung base would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Findings consistent with background COPD.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:11 AM, less than 5
 minutes after discovery of the findings.  Findings were later discussed by Dr.
 ___ with ___, the covering resident, by phone, at 09:26 a.m. on ___.  He indicated that pressures on the line and blood gases have
 subsequently been obtained and are thought to be more concordant with SVC
 location of the line. If any clinical question remains, then a lateral view of
 the chest and, if indicated, targeted CT could help to definitively confirm
 line placement.
