                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain  // evaluation for etiology of
 chest pain and interval evaluation of central line
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from earlier the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation consistent of background COPD.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  Also again seen is
 upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 At the left base, there is subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring, but no
 frank consolidation.  There is a small amount of left pleural fluid and/or
 thickening.  The appearance is probably not significantly from earlier the
 same day, changed allowing for technical differences.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  Biapical pleural scarring is is unchanged.
 
 Mild thoracic -spine degenerative changes noted.  No displaced rib fracture or
 obvious thoracic compression fracture identified.
 
 Appearance of the right IJ central line is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. COPD.
 2. Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF.
 3. Subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring at the left base and possible
 small amount of pleural fluid versus thickening, unchanged.
 4. No focal pneumonic infiltrate detected.  No pneumothorax.
 5. Right IJ line unchanged in configuration.  As noted, the course of the line
 raises the possibility of an arterial position, but this appearance could also
 be artifactual due to patient rotation and possible left-sided volume loss. 
 As before, if there is ongoing clinical concern for the course of the central
 line, then a lateral chest x-ray and/or targeted CT images could help to
 confirm position.
