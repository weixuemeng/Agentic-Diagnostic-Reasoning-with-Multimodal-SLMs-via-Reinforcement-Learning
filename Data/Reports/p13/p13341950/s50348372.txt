                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.  History of COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a patchy linear opacity projecting along the lingula, as before,
 suggesting persistent minor atelectasis or scarring.  Streaky right upper lobe
 opacities suggest scarring with post-operative suture material that is
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The patient is
 status post partly visualized posterior upper lumbar fusion.  Volume loss and
 sclerosis along thoracolumbar vertebral bodies at the site of fusion and
 immediately above appear probably unchanged.  The patient is also status post
 anterior neck fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic opacities suggesting minor scarring without definite
 evidence for acute disease.
