                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC  // r/o trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the torso dated ___, performed prior to this
 radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are well-expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. 
 No rib fractures.  A bullet-shaped metallic density fragment projects over the
 left scapula.  Several additional small and punctate foci of metallic density
 material project over the upper left chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute sequela of trauma.
 2. Bullet-shaped metallic density fragment projects over the left scapula,
 with several additional metallic density fragments projecting over the upper
 left chest.  Recommend correlation with history.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Bullet-shaped metallic density fragment projects over the
 left scapula, with several additional metallic density fragments projecting
 over the upper left chest.  Recommend correlation with history.
 
  Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
