 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L knee septic arthritis, with wheezing and
 crackles on exam, evidence of volume overload on exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An 8 mm right upper lung nodule is again identified.  A rounded 3.8 cm opacity

 pleural/parenchymal nodule.  Right PICC line remains unchanged in the mid SVC.
 Lung parenchyma is unchanged from prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Left costophrenic angle
 blunting stable since ___, likely represents pleural thickening rather
 than pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. 8 mm right upper lung nodule and nodular opacity at the left hemidiaphragm
 would be better assessed by dedicated chest CT.
 2. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT for characterization of right upper lung nodule
 and left peridiaphragmatic opacity.
