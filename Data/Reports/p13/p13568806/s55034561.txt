                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post PEG placement, symptoms concerning
 for aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is low lung volumes bilaterally with areas of linear
 opacification inferiorly, most likely representing bibasilar atelectasis;
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting, there could be superimposed
 aspiration.  Otherwise, there are no other areas of focal consolidation. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged and within normal limits.  The pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 aspiration cannot be ruled out.
