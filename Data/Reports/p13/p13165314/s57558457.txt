                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Productive cough. Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is redemonstration of an opacity in the lingula, which is better
 evaluated on prior chest CT examination and is suggestive of primary lung
 cancer.  There has been interval increase of left lower lobe opacity, which
 could be due to increasing lingular mass or postobstructive pneumonia.  Mild
 atelectasis is noted at the right lung base. The right lung is otherwise
 clear. There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter terminates in the distal SVC. 
 There is dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular pulmonary mass suggestive of primary lung cancer, better assessed on
 prior chest CT examination.  Increased opacity at the left lung base could be
 due to increasing lingular mass or postobstructive pneumonia. Short interval
 follow up is recommended after treatment.
