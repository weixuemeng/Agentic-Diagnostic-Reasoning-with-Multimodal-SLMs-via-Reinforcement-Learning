                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is an opacity in the lingula, better evaluated on
 dedicated chest CT on ___ and suggestive of a primary lung
 cancer.  However, there is new opacity overlying the left lower lobe which is
 likely a small pleural effusion. Additionally, there is a new right lower lobe
 opacity suggestive of pneumonia.  Previously noted multiple other nodules
 involving the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and right
 lower lobe are better delineated on the dedicated chest CT.  Severe emphysema
 is again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Dextroscoliosis
 of the thoracic spine appears stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Again noted the lingular pulmonary mass suggestive of a primary lung
 cancer as well.  Multiple other lung nodules are better delineated in
 dedicated chest CT from ___.
 2.  New right lower lobe opacity suggestive of pneumonia and new left lower
 lobe opacity suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
