 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic RCC, productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  The image is compared to ___.  The patient now
 carries a right Port-A-Cath.  The lung volumes have substantially decreased
 and the size of the cardiac silhouette has also increased.  As a consequence,
 there is increased vascular crowding with minimal diameter of the vascular
 structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  No hilar or
 mediastinal adenopathy.
