                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent cough for two weeks,
 now low-grade temperatures, severe reactions to antibiotic, evaluate for
 infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is a moderate degree of right-sided convex scoliosis in the
 lower half of the thoracic spine which accounts for its slightly asymmetric
 appearance of the chest on the frontal view.  No other significant skeletal
 abnormalities are seen.  The heart size is normal.  No configurational
 abnormality is present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs
 of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical
 area.
 
 There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate scoliosis in lower thoracic spine but otherwise
 chest findings within normal limits.  Thus, no evidence of acute infiltrates.
