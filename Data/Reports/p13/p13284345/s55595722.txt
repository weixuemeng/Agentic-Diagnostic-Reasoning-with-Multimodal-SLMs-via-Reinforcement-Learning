                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is mild-to-moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is mildly ectatic.  There is mild fullness
 of the hila, and mild perihilar and bibasilar hazy opacities are most
 suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable mild pulmonary edema, though, an atypical infection
 cannot be excluded.
