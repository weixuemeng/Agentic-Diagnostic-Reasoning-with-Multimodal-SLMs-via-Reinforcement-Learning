 known history of lymphadenopathy.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.

 Similar-appearing chest radiograph with persistent bibasilar hazy opacities
 and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Prominence of the hila is stable,
 previously seen hilar lymphadenopathy.
