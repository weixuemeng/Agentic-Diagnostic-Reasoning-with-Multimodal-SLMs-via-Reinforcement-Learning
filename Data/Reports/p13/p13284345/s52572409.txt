                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.  Compared to prior, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again seen are increased interstitial markings
 throughout the lungs.  There is no focal consolidation or effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Diffusely increased
 interstitial markings throughout the lungs similar to multiple prior exams,
 which raise the possibility of chronic underlying lung disease.  Clinical
 correlation suggested regarding need for non-urgent chest CT to further
 characterize.
