                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ronchi, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiology and CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists.  Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged, and enlargement of the hila bilaterally is compatible with
 lymphadenopathy as seen on the prior CT. Mild perihilar haziness suggests mild
 pulmonary edema, slightly improved from prior.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine with bridging anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the previous exam.
