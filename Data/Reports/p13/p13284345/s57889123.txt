 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CTA.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is again demonstrated
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  There is mild perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, similar compared to the prior exam.
