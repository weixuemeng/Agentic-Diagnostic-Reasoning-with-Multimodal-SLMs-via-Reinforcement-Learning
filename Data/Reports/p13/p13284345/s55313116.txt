                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation, nausea, vomiting.  Assess for acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___. CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate well expanded lungs. Mild
 interstital prominance likely represents underlying chronic underlying disease
 as seen on patient's prior studies without an acute superimposed process. The
 pleural surfaces are normal without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart
 size is minimally enlarged however has improved from prior study.  Mediastinal
 contour is normal.  Slight hilar prominence is unchanged and is compatible
 with lymphadenopathy seen on CT from ___.  Limited assessment of the
 upper abdomen is unremarkable without evidence of intraperitoneal air.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process to explain patient's symptoms.
