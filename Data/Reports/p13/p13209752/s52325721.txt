                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG with pleural effusion, has it increased in size?
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Opacification at the left base is again consistent with pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  It may have slightly increased, though this is
 difficult to determine since the degree of patient elevation may be different
 between the two images.
 
 Remainder of the study is unchanged and essentially within normal limits.
