                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  High fever and productive cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  Patchy but fairly extensive
 opacity in the right lower lobe is compatible with pneumonia.  There are also
 patchy right middle lobe opacities, fairly streaky, but an additional
 potential focus of pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Elsewhere the lungs appear clear.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, most prominent at
 the latter site, suggesting pneumonia.
