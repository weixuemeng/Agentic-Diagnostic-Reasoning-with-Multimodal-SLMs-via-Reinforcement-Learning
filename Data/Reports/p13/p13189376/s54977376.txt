 Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC.  Status post median
 sternotomy with stably enlarged postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours.  Lung volumes are lower with crowding of the vasculature and there
 is worsening superimposed pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities with
 associated effusions are again seen consistent with partial lower lobe
 compressive atelectasis.  Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 pneumothorax.
