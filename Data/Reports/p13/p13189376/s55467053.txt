                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG  // eval postop changes      eval
 postop changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Allowing for that, there is probably little change in the degree
 of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient with intact midline
 sternal wires.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure and there is mild blunting of the
 costophrenic angles.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
 Right subclavian PICC line again extends to the mid to lower portion of the
 SVC.
