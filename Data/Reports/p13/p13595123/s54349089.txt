                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Asthma with central chest discomfort and difficulty
 breathing.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum demonstrated on the current
 examination.  Bibasal opacities are noted and might reflect small areas of
 atelectasis, new since the prior study that might also reflect compromised
 aeration through compromised airways or fatigue of inspiration musculature,
 please correlate clinically.
