                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is top normal. 
 The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The hilar contours and mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There may
 be subtle reticulation within the lung bases, but no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are minimal degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Minimal
 reticulation of the lung bases may be due to chronic changes.
