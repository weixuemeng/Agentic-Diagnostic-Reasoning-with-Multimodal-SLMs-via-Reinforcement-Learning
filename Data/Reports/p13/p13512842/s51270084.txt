                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  The lungs are clear of focal consolidation or
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  There is a lobulated soft
 tissue density projecting over the lateral aspect of the descending aorta,
 potentially arising from it and should be further characterized with CT scan. 
 This had been seen on prior, but is more conspicuous on today's exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Lobulated soft tissue
 density projecting over the lateral aspect of the descending thoracic aorta
 presumable an aneurysm versus less likley adjacent mass.  Further
 characterization is suggested by CT scan.
