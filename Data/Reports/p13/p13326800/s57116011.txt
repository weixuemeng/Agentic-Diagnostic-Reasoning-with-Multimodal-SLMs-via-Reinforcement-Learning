                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent, perhaps somewhat increased opacification in the posterior
 left lower lobe indicating atelectasis superimposed on a large rounded mass in
 the left posterior costophrenic sulcus which is similar in size although hard
 to compare to the prior CT for small possible changes. Elsewhere, the lungs
 remain clear. Additional known nodules are not well seen on radiography for
 the most part. There is no definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild increase in opacification in the left lower lobe, probably associated
 with atelectasis in the vicinity of a large known metastasis.
