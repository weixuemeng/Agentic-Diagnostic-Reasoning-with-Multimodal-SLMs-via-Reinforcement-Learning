 INDICATION:  ___F with back pain  // eval for consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Scarring and fiducial marker in the right upper lobe is from prior resection
 and treatment.  There is increased interstitial opacities bilaterally, which
 may represent a combination of chronic scarring and/or pulmonary edema.  Heart
 size is enlarged but stable.  Mediastinal contours are enlarged representing
 venous congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial markings potentially due to chronic changes and/or
 mild pulmonary edema.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia.
 3. Chronic scarring in the right upper lobe from prior treatment.
