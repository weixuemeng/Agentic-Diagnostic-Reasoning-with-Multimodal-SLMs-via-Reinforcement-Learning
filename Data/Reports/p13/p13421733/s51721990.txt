                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube
 extends at least to the stomach. A right IJ catheter terminates at the mid
 SVC.  A left cardiac pacemaker projects a lead into the right atrium, however
 the defibrillation and  ventricular pacer wires deviate at the level of the
 tricuspid valve, the latter possibly taking a left ventricular course.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Numerous predominantly right-sided
 nodular opacities are minimally changed since the prior two chest radiographs
 performed on the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Widespread right nodular opacities may reflect multifocal pneumonia. 
 Following resolution of acute symptoms, CT is recommended as these opacities
 could represent pulmonary nodules or masses.
 2.  Possible left ventricular course of a pacemaker lead .  Correlate with any
 available lateral radiographs, otherwise, one could be obtained here at ___.
