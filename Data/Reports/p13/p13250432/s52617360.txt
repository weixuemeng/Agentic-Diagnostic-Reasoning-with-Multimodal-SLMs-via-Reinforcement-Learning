                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Near syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with a left ventricular predominance, unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable with aortic knob calcifications present.  Streaky
 opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacities at the lung bases most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
