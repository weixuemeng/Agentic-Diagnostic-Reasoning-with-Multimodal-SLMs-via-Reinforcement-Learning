 INDICATION:  Reintubation, evaluation for ETT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:05.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is 2 cm above the carina.  It
 should be retracted by approximately 2 cm.  The pre-existing opacities at the
 lung bases, likely to be caused by atelectasis, are unchanged.  Unchanged
 course of the nasogastric tube with coiling of the tube tip in the stomach. 
 No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.  No evidence of complications.
