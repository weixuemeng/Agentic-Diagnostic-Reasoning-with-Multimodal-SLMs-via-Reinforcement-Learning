                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post dissection repair with desaturation, question effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 8:02 a.m., I doubt significant interval change. 
 
 Again seen is sternotomy, with AVR, mild cardiomegaly, left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation, possibly with a small left effusion.  There is
 background COPD.  Doubt significant CHF.  Minimal patchy opacity in the left
 midzone is unchanged.  The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from
 the film, but no focal infiltrate or significant right effusion is identified.
 Minimal patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is unchanged.  
 
 A Dobbhoff-type tube is present.  The radiopaque tip appears more proximal
 than on the previous film, now overlying the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared with ___.
