                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with an aortic dissection repair, evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A feeding tube remains coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Interval extubation and removal of the right internal jugular
 introducer.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with overall stable
 post-operative cardiac enlargement and stable mediastinal contours.  There
 continues to be retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting a combination of
 compressive atelectasis and layering effusion.  Linear opacities at the right
 base are again seen and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema on the current examination.  No
 pneumothorax.
