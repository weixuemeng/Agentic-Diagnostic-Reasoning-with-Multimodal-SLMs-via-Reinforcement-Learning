                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with low-grade temperature.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vascularity is much less prominent,
 consistent with some improved vascular congestion, though some of this could
 be a manifestation of the erect position of the patient.  No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
