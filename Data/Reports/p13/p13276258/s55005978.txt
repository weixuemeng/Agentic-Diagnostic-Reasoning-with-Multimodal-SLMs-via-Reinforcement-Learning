                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right internal jugular line placement,
 evaluate for placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show diffuse multifocal airspace opacities.  A
 right IJ catheter is noted in appropriate position.  No definite pneumothorax
 is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The hilar contours
 are not well evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal airspace opacities are mildly progressed and likely represent a
 combination of known metastatic disease and mild to moderate pulmonary edema
 although super-infection, particularly in the right upper lobe, cannot be
 excluded.  Appropriate position of right IJ line.
