                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, UTI, new O2 requirement  // please
 evaluate for e/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs appear hyperinflated.
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the
 posterior CP angle on the lateral projection suggests possible tiny effusion
 versus pleural thickening. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with a
 tortuous thoracic aorta. Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs without definite signs of pneumonia. Possible small
 basilar pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.
