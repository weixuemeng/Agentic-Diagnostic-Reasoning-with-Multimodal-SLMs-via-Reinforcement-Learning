                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Delirium and cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is generalized faint
 interstitial abnormality bilaterally.  Apparent mediastinal widening may be
 artifactual due to lordotic positioning.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Generalized interstitial abnormality bilaterally may reflect history of
 COPD. There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely artifactual due to lordotic
 positioning.
