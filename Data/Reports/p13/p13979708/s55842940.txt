                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after VATS biopsy of the left lung 2 weeks previously.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 appearing mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Left lower lateral
 pleural thickening appears relatively unchanged.  Hazy opacification within
 the left lung base could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Right lung is grossly clear.    No pneumothorax is seen. There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Unchanged degree of left inferior lateral pleural thickening.
