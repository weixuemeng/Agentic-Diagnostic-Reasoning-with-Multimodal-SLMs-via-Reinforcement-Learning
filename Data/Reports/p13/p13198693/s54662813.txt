                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Elevated white blood count.  Comparison is made with prior
 study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There are lower lung volumes.  Worsening
 bibasilar opacities are consistent with worsening atelectasis.  Right central
 catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.  There is mild vascular congestion. 
 A catheter projects over the left hemithorax, unclear if it is outside the
 patient.
