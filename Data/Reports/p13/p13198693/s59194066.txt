                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new NG tube, check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest with patient in semi-erect position
 demonstrates an NG tube that reaches the fundus of the stomach.  In this
 location, the line reverses and its tip is directed back into the esophagus
 pointing in retrograde fashion.  This line requires positional adjustment.  No
 pneumothorax or any other placement-related complications identified.
