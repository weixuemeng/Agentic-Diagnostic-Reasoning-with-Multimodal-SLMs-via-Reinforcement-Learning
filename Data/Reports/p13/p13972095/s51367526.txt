 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer status post
 ET tube placement, presents for evaluation of ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 1.8 cm above the carina.  The slight interval
 increase in hazy opacity projecting over the left lower lobe is probably from
 a layering pleural effusion which also has a fissural component.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Again seen is a dual-lead pacemaker ICD device with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively, unchanged
 compared to prior exam.  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 ET tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina. Increased left pleural effusion
 
 These findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 3:40 a.m. via
