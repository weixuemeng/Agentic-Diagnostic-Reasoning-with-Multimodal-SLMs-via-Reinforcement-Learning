 the interstitial markings; however, no focal consolidation is present. 
 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.

 1. Right internal jugular catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes, but, otherwise, clear lungs.
