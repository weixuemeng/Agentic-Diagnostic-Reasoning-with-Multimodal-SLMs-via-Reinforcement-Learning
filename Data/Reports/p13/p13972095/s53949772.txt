                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New ET tube and OG tube in, evaluate placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 00:43.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 6.7 cm above the carina. New OG tube tip is below the diaphragm;
 however, side port above the diaphragm.  Compared with the 30 minutes prior,
 lung volumes have increased, but the pulmonary vasculature is now indistinct
 compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube in satisfactory position.
 
 2. OG tube with the side port above the GE junction, should be repositioned
 (this radiograph was read after the subsequent radiograph at 6:40 in which the
 OG tube has been removed so no call was made).
 
 3. Mild pulmonary edema.  No sufficient pulmonary abnormality to support a
 diagnosis of ARDS.
