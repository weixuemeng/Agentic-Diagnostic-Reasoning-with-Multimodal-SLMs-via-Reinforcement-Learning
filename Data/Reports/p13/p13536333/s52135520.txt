 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is moderate unfolding along
 the descending thoracic aorta.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic
 spine.

 in the lower lobes are most consistent with atelectasis.
