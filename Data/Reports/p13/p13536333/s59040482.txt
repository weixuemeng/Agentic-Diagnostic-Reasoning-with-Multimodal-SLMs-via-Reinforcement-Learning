 ___; no localizing findings on today's exam  // please assess for recurrent
 pneumonia     please assess for recurrent pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation due to pronounced emphysema is chronic.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly has been worse, in ___, when there was also pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pulmonary edema currently.
 
 Overlying breast soft tissue accounts for some of the radiodensity projecting
 over the lower lungs, but on the lateral view in either the middle lobe or the
 lingula, there is new opacification.  I suspect there is a small middle lobe
 pneumonia.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
