                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, suggesting COPD.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly, overall similar to the prior film.  Slight focal
 prominence of the left heart border superiorly is similar to ___,
 allowing for differences in technique, and is consistent with a left atrial
 appendage.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous and could be ectatic, but
 appears unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora as well as
 atelectasis at the right base, new compared with ___.  No focal
 consolidation and no joint effusion is identified.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, with right base atelectasis,
 consistent with CHF.  No focal consolidation is identified, though, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, an early infiltrate would be difficult to
 exclude.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Probable background COPD.
