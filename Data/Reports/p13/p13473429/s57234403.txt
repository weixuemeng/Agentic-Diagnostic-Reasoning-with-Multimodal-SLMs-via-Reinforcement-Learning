                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest/back discomfort, asthma, hx tb?  //
 any worrisome lesion?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There remains marked left upper lobe volume loss in association with traction
 bronchiectasis, parenchymal scarring, architectural distortion and
 asymmetrical left apical thickening.  In the setting of scattered calcified
 granulomas in both lungs, this is most likely the sequela of the provided
 history of previous granulomatous infection.  Appearance of the lungs is
 otherwise similar to the prior exam except for a 1 cm well-circumscribed
 rounded opacity in the right upper lung at the level of the fifth posterior
 rib, not clearly seen on the prior exam.  Heart size remains normal.  There is
 no evidence of pleural effusion.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with sequelae of previous granulomatous infection.
 
 Apparently new 1 cm nodular opacity in right upper lung.
 
 RECOMMENDATION:  Initial further evaluation with 15 degree shallow oblique
 radiographs is recommended for confirmation of apparently new right upper lung
 nodular opacity.  If confirmed, CT would be recommended for further
 characterization.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:19 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
