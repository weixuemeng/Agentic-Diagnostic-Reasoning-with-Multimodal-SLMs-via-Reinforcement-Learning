                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with left lower lobe crackles.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is patchy opacification with apical thickening and fibrotic
 change in the left apex with apparent retraction of the trachea to this side. 
 This is consistent with old granulomatous disease.  Scattered granulomas are
 seen in the right lung as well.  The information has been discussed with Dr.
 ___.  In discussion with the patient, the patient has had some previous
 known evidence of old granulomatous disease.
 
 Specifically, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Minimal
 streaking most likely fibrosis or atelectasis is seen at the left base.
