 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 12:33 are
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian central line unchanged in position. The heart remains enlarged
 which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Patchy opacity at
 both bases, left greater than right, likely reflect compressive atelectasis. 
 Surgical clips overlie the right axillary region. There is also deformity of
 the right humeral head which is incompletely visualized suggestive of an old
 fracture. Mild vascular prominent with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
