 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 04:44
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube now has its tip 3.8 cm above the carina. The left subclavian
 central line is unchanged in position. Improved aeration at the left base with
 patchy residual bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis.  Interval
 resolution of mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely unchanged. Probable layering effusions, left greater than
 right. Surgical clips in the right axilla consistent with prior axillary node
 dissection.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax
 is diminished given supine technique.
