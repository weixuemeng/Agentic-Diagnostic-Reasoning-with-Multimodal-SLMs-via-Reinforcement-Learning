                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known cancer with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There
 is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  The
 known right lower lobe nodule is not well assessed by this modality.  This and
 the extensive blastic metastatic disease are better characterized on the prior
 CT.
