                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of lung cancer with hypotension, nausea, vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Right paratracheal mediastinal
 widening is compatible with known underlying lymphadenopathy.  Hilar contours
 are unchanged and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Emphysematous
 changes are again noted.  A right lower lobe lesion posteriorly abutting the
 pleura appears unchanged compared to the recent chest CT.  Ill-defined
 spiculated area within the left mid lung field appears unchanged compared to
 the prior chest radiograph, and does not appear to have a correlate on the CT.
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Innumerable sclerotic
 metastases are better observed on the prior CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Persistent mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy and right lower lobe lesion compatible with malignancy.
