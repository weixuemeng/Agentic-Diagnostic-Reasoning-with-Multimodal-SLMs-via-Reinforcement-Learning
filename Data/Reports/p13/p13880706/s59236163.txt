                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with small cell lung cancer.  Question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small faint lung nodules in the periphery of the right lung could represent
 early pneumonia, particularly viral, but I see no sufficient consolidation to
 raise concern for a bacterial infection.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are normal.  Emphysema is reflected in hyperinflation.
