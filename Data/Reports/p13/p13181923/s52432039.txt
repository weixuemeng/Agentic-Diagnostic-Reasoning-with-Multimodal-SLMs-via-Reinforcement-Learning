                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain, fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar appearing hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms
 representing COPD-related changes.  Emphysematous changes in the bilateral
 apices again noted.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with
 similar-appearing clips in the right hilum and atherosclerotic calcification
 of the aorta.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe likely represents
 area of chronic fibrosis or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  Limited assessment of the bones is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Chronic changes related to COPD including hyperinflation, flattening of
 the diaphragms and emphysema in the lung apices. 
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe likely represents fibrosis
 or atelectasis. No definite lobar pneumonia. 
 
 Results were conveyed via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 9:05
