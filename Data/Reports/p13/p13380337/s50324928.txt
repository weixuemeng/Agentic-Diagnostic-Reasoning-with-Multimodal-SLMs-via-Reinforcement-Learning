                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 slight prominence of the hila which may be due to pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, although underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded, particularly
 on the left.  The patient's chin partially overlying the left lung apex. 
 Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity is seen, which while could relate to
 atelectasis or aspiration, underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta remains tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 Surgical clips are seen in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight prominence of the hila, particularly of the left hilum
 which while could relate to vascular engorgement, underlying lymphadenopathy
 is not excluded.  Findings could be further evaluated on chest CT.  Subtle
 left base retrocardiac opacity is seen, which while could relate to
 atelectasis or aspiration, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
