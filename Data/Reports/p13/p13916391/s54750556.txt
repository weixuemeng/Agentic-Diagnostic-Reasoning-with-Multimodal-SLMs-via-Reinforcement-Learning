                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with past medical history of alcoholic
 cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Study requested for evaluation of
 pleural effusions and/or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is somewhat rotated.  There is a right retrocardiac opacity
 that corresponds to opacification along the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Patchy and linear opacities are seen within the left lung base
 and are likely due to atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right retrocardiac opacity, representing either atelectasis or pneumonia.
 Short term followup CXR is recommended for evaluation of interval resolution.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
