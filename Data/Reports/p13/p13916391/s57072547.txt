                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  Given
 differences in positioning and technique, the lungs are clear, noting that the
 retrocardiac region is relatively dense which could be technical and
 positional.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity, potentially technical in nature; however,
 if concern, repeat exam with frontal and lateral views may help further
 characterize.
