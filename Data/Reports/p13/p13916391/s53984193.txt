                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  A small right
 pneumothorax is present.  Within the lungs, right retrocardiac opacity has
 improved, but patchy opacity persists at the left lung base, and could relate
 to either atelectasis or pneumonia.  Pigtail catheter overlies the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen and has been re-positioned since the previous study.
