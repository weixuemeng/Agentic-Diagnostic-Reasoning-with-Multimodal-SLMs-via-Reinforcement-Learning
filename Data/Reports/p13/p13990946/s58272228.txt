                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___m tachycardia please obtain standing   lateral xr  // ___m
 tachycardia please obtain standing   lateral xr
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, but somewhat improved compared to the previous study.
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature
 is not engorged.  There is improved aeration of the lung bases with residual
 patchy opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistently low lung volumes, but slight interval improvement in degree of
 aeration of the lungs.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective
 of atelectasis.
