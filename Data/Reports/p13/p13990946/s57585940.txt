                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears mildly enlarged.  Widening of the mediastinum is due to the
 presence of low lung volumes.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is
 present without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis.  No
 pulmonary edema.
