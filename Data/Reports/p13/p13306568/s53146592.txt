                                 FINAL REPORT

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated, but clear.  No evidence of pneumonia,
 pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  No gross osseous
 acute deformity of the ribs or significant compression deformity of the
 thoracic spine, although chest radiographs provided limited assessment for
 such.  Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament throughout the
 majority of the thoracic spine is indicative of diffuse idiopathic skeletal
 hyperostosis.
