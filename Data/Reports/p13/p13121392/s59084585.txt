                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with L shoulder pain, chest pain  // eval for consolidation,
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left pleural catheter is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Persistent left
 basilar pleural effusion has not significantly changed since most recent
 examination.  Underlying parenchymal opacities with some distortion of the
 underlying parenchyma laterally is compatible with patient's known neoplasm
 and associated possible lymphangitic spread or edema.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to accurately assess.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change noting persistent left pleural effusion with
 pleural catheter in place and similar underlying parenchymal changes
 compatible with underlying lesion with associated parenchymal changes as
 above.
