                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to radiograph from ___, there has been interval
 resolution of pneumothorax and substantial decreased left pleural fluid. 
 There is left pleural fluid, which probably has redistributed, and persistent
 compressive atelectasis.  Opacity along the left lateral aspect and the lower
 lung are consistent with patient's known lung cancer and is better appreciated
 on the PET-CT from ___.  Again seen is bilateral increased
 interstitial opacities, likely reflecting lymphangitic spread.  Heart size is
 difficult to assess but likely upper limits of normal.Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. There is no evidence for pneumothorax.Left PleurX
 catheter tip projects over the left mid hemithorax.  Aortic knob calcification
 appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumothorax.
 2. Left pleural effusion, likely unchanged given differences in technique. 
 Left lower lung opacities, likely patient's known cancer which is better
 appreciated on prior CT.
