                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube.
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the Dobbhoff tube has been
 advanced so that it coils within the upper stomach.  Oral contrast material is
 seen in non-dilated loops of small bowel.  Little overall change in the
 appearance of the heart and lungs.
