 detected.  The azygos vein is at the upper limits of normal in diameter, but
 may be slightly accentuated by lordotic technique.  Minimal atelectasis at the
 left base medially.No free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.  No pneumothorax
 detected. Mild degenerative changes in the upper lumbar spine, incompletely
 evaluated.
