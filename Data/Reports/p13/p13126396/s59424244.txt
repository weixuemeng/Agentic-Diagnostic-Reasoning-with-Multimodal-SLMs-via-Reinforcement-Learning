                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and new lower extremity swelling, evaluate for volume
 overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the prior examination from ___, there has been
 interval development of moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions,
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, and apparent mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 focal consolidation or pneumothorax identified.  The medistinal contours are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and interstitial
 pulmonary edema highly suggestive of fluid overload. However, as the true
 acuity of these findings cannot be established, other causes of acute cardiac
 enlargement such as a pericardial effusion cannot be definitively excluded.
 
 Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 5:03pm on ___. at
 the time of discovery.
