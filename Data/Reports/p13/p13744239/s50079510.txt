                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with HIV, AIDS, and pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, now
 complains of wheezing, localized to left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is present, but the distribution
 has changed.  There has been clearing of a relatively discrete segment
 previously in the right upper lobe and considerable improvement in lower lobe
 involvement.  There is, however, more discrete nodulation scattered throughout
 both lungs.  Overall, the findings suggest patient had pneumocystis pneumonia
 which improved, although it may not have cleared and now has more extensive
 metastatic Kaposi sarcoma.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart size is
 normal.
