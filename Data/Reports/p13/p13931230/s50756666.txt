                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain associated with  shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation and oblique positioning.
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  Aorta is tortuous
 and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema and small left pleural effusion are demonstrated. Retrocardiac patchy
 opacity is most likely atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine which is diffusely
 demineralized with findings suggestive of a severe compression deformity
 within the upper/mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion. Retrocardiac patchy
 opacity, likely atelectasis.
