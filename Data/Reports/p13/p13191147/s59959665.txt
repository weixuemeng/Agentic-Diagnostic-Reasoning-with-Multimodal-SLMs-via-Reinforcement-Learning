 INDICATION:  ___-year-old lady with left posterior chest pain and history of
 ulcerative colitis with subtotal colectomy and severe kyphosis, ? new chest
 lesion left posterior.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.

 aorta appears to be tortuous, but cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  The lung volumes are reduced, and there is increased AP
 diameter of the chest secondary to known severe kyphosis of the thoracic spine
 with evidence of old compression fractures at multiple levels.  There is also
 evidence of old rib fractures on the left.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural
 effusions and no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant changes compared to the prior study.
