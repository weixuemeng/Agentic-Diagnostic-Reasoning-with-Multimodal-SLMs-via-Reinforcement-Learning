                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CP  // C/f PNA, possible extension of mets
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Probable background hyperinflation/COPD, though inspiratory volumes on the
 frontal view are slightly low.
 
 Again seen are sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips, with linear
 radiodensities seen adjacent to the right mainstem bronchus, similar to the
 prior study.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 No CHF or effusion.  Subsegmental atelectasis is present at both lung bases. 
 However, no focal consolidation is identified.
 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary
 nodules are identified.  (Subtle abnormalities might not be apparent
 radiographically.) biapical pleural thickening is similar to the prior study.
 
 Again seen is slight accentuation of thoracic kyphosis, with minimal
 degenerative changes and slight nonacute wedging of multiple mid thoracic
 vertebral bodies.  Relative increased density of the T12 vertebral body is
 compatible with previously described findings.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar atelectasis.  Probable background COPD.
 2. No CHF or focal consolidation identified.
 3. No obvious pulmonary metastasis, though small nodules could be
 radiographically occult.
 4. Sclerotic T12 vertebral body again noted, not fully evaluated.
