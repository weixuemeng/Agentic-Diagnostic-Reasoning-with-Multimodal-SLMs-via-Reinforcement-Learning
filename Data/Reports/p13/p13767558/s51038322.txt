                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, ESRD s/p renal transplant here with
 chest pain, r/o PE  // eval for pneumonia, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  DEXA x-ray dated ___ at 17:31.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Inspiratory volumes are at the lower limits of normal or minimally diminished.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with sternotomy wires and multiple
 mediastinal clips noted.  Again seen is curvilinear density adjacent to the
 right heart border question related to prior surgery.  No CHF. Minimal
 atelectasis at both lung bases is probably slightly improved.  The possibility
 of minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles cannot be excluded, but no
 gross pleural effusion is identified.  Biapical pleural thickening is again
 noted, similar to the prior film.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Status post sternotomy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 2. No CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion.
 3. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis appears slightly improved.
