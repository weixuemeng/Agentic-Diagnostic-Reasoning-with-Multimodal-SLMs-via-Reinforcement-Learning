                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, was
 similar enlargement of the hilar regions bilaterally. Lung volumes are low
 with patchy opacity in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. There
 may be mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Widening of the right AC
 joint is unchanged, and may be postsurgical.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities the lung bases, potentially
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  Probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
