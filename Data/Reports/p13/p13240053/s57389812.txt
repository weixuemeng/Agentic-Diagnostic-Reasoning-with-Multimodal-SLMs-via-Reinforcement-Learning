                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Leg swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is obscuration of the bilateral diaphragms worrisome for pleural effusions
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded.
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  No definite evidence
 of pneumothorax is seen.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 The cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed due to the bibasilar
 opacities, although appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinum is not widened. 
 The aortic knob calcification is seen.  Chronic deformity at the right
 shoulder/proximal humerus is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mediastinum is not widened.
 2.  Obscuration of the diaphragms, raising concern for pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  Mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.
