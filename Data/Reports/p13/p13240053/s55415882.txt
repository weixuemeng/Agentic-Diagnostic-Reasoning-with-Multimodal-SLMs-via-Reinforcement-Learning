                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Significant coronary history having an acute chest discomfort and
 reproducible on the left side.  Evaluate for a fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi erect portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is rotated and the lung volumes are low which limits
 evaluation.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
 atelectasis which have increased in size from prior.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged. There certainly isn't evidence of severe pulmonary
 edema. No pneumothorax. 
 
 There is no displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increase in moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  No displaced rib fracture.  If further concern for a fracture persists, a
 dedicated rib series with markers would be useful.
