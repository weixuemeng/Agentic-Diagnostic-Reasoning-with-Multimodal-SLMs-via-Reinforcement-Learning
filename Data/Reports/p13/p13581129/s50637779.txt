 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal,
 likely exaggerated by AP technique.  The patient is rotated slightly to the
 right.  There aorta is somewhat tortuous.  No large pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Old right-sided posterior 7th rib deformity
 is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  Consider dedicated
 PA and lateral views for further and better evaluation.
