                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with presumed TRALI,
 assessment of the ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is
 in the stomach.  Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is stable. 
 Widespread parenchymal opacities might be consistent with edema, moderate in
 severity, with slightly more asymmetric involvement of the left lung as
 compared to the right, thus underlying additional process such as for example
 infection cannot be excluded.
