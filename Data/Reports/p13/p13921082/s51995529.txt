 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Inability to walk.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A medial right basilar opacity has fully resolved.  A left
 retrocardiac opacity has mostly resolved, leaving slight patchy residual
 opacity with volume loss at the left lung base.  There is a possible residual
 pleural effusion on the left side, probably small.  There may also be a trace
 right-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for increased
 leftward rotation on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in lower lung opacities with patchy residual
 left basilar opacification.
