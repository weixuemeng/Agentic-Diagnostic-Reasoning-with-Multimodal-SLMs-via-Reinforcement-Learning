                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a diffuse interstitial abnormality that is likely chronic
 in nature, not significantly changed compared to the prior chest radiograph
 from ___.  Increased left retrocardiac consolidation is at least
 partially attributable to worsening atelectasis, although infection at the
 left base is certainly possible.  Heterogeneous right lower lung opacities
 have also increased, possibly secondary to increased atelectasis or new
 aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 possibly increased, not well assessed on the single portable radiograph from
 ___.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracolumbar spine are noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased left retrocardiac consolidation, likely at least partially
 attributable to increased atelectasis, although infection or aspiration
 pneumonitis in this region is certainly possible.
 
 2.  Increased right lower lung heterogeneous opacities, likely secondary to a
 combination of atelectasis and aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
 
 3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, possibly slightly increased in size
 compared to the prior study from ___.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:03 p.m.
 via telephone on the day of the study.
