                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is apparent increased opacity in the retrocardiac
 region.  This is likely partially attributed to mitral annular calcifications;
 however, underlying consolidation is also possible.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Hypertrophic
 change is seen in the spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Hyperinflation with possible retrocardiac opacity, for which
 dedicated two-view chest x-ray is suggested to further characterize if patient
 is amenable.
