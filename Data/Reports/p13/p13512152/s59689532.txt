  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs more conspicuous on today's exam.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are appropriate. Increased interstitial markings are seen in the
 lungs with a predominantly peripheral distribution, more prominent on the
 right than on the left.  These may also have been faintly visualized on prior.
 There is no confluent consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires are again noted. Old left
 lateral rib fracture is again noted. No acute osseous abnormality is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings in the lungs more conspicuous on today's exam.
 This may be due to a chronic interstitial process, or alternatively atypical
 infection.  Based on history, nonurgent CT scan could be considered for
 further assessment. No confluent consolidation.
