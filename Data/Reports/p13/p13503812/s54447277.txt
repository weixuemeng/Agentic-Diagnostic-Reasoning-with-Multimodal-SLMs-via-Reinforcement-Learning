                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly low.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  Mild pulmonary vascular prominence may be
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Heart and mediastinal contours are also
 exaggerated by low lung volumes.  An enteric catheter terminates in the
 epigastric region likely within the distal stomach.  An endotracheal tube tip
 terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.
 
 There is right acromioclavicular separation, incompletely imaged.  A small
 ossified fragment superior to the left distal clavicle is likely chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate endotracheal tube positioning.
 2.  Right acromioclavicular separation, incompletely imaged.  Shoulder
 radiographs are recommended. 
 3.  Small bony fragment adjacent to the left distal clavicle, which may be
 chronic in nature.  But given history of recent trauma, correlation for pain
 at this site is recommended.
