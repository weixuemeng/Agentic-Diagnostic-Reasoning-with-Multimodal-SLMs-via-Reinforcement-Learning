                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral views of chest demonstrate an extensive left -sided pleural
 effusion with compressive atelectasis; an underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded. A tiny right pleural effusion may also be present. The cardiac
 silhouette also appears enlarged, but it is difficult to completely assess the
 left border given the large pleural effusion.  The right lung is clear of
 focal opacities worrisome for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Large left-sided pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded. 
 
 2. Difficult to assess, but possibly enlarging cardiac silhouette; query
 underlying pericardial effusion
