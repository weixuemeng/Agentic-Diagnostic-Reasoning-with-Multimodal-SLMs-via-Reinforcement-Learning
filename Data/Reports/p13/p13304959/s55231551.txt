                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for body swelling, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Increased interstitial prominence,
 particularly in the lung bases associated with mild bronchial cuffing, may
 relate to atypical pneumonia with bronchitis or fluid overload.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax present.  No osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchial cuffing with bibasilar reticular opacifications may
 reflect fluid overload versus atypical bronchopneumonia. Correlate clinically.
