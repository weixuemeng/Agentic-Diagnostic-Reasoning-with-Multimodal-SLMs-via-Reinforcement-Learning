                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F T3N0 gastric adenocarcinoma s/p neoadjuvant therapy s/p
 robotic/lap total gastrectomy and J-tube placement  // aspiration    
 aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.  Uniform
 opacification at the base of the left lung is probably atelectasis,
 accompanied by small left pleural effusion.  Atelectasis is also seen in the
 right middle lobe.  Aspiration is not excluded, but is not suggested by these
 findings.  Upper lungs clear.  Heart size top-normal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
