                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman intubated, spinal injury  // ? effusions,
 consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs dated ___, there has been interval
 removal of bilateral chest tubes.  No pneumothoraces.  Lung volumes remain
 low.  Opacification at the bilateral lung bases, somewhat improved on right,
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No appreciable effusions.  No new focal
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Multiple bilateral
 displaced rib fractures are unchanged and better assessed on prior chest CT
 from ___.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina,
 unchanged.  Esophageal drainage tube extends below the diaphragm and
 terminates in the distal stomach, with side ports either at or slightly beyond
 the esophagogastric junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of bilateral chest tubes.  No pneumothorax.  No appreciable
 effusions.  Improving opacification of the bilateral lung bases, predominantly
 on the right, reflecting improved aeration.
