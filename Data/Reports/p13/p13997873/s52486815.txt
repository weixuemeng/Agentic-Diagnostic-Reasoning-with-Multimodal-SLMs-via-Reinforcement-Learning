                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Single chamber ICD placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 The single-chamber pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of the
 left ventricle.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Dextroscoliosis is
 redemonstrated, substantial.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Small nodular opacity at the mid portion of the right lung is noted,
 projecting over posterior aspect of the right sixth rib, most likely
 representing bronchial impaction but followup of the patient in three months
 with chest radiograph for documentation of stability/resolution is required.
