                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:06 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  Assess single
 chamber ICD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, but the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged
 and there is no edema or pleural effusion.  A ___-mm long mildly irregular
 nodular opacity projecting over the upper aspect of the right third anterior
 rib on one view occupies a slightly different position with respect to that
 rib on the second.  Therefore, I cannot attribute this to region of benign
 sclerosis in the rib.  I would recommend shallow oblique views to see if there
 is a lung nodule instead.  A second similar lesion projects over the
 intersection of the left second anterior and fourth posterior ribs just medial
 to the left axillary pacemaker.  If the nature of these radiographic findings
 is not clarified by conventional radiographs and CT scan should be obtained. 
 Lower lungs are clear.  There is no pleural abnormality or evidence of central
 adenopathy.
 
 The left subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead follows the
 expected course to the anticipated location of the right ventricular apex. 
 Thoracic scoliosis is mild.
 
 There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
