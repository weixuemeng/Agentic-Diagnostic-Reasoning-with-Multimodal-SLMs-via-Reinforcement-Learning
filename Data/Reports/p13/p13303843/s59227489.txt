                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax after fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest radiograph.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in stable
 position.  Left upper lobe collapse and small left pneumothorax persists.  The
 left lower lobe is partially opacified but also obscured by the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Mild leftward shift of the trachea is
 consistent with volume loss.  The right lung is hyperexpanded.  Spiculated
 mass seen on CT is partially obscured by the right first rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small left pneumothorax.
 2.  Left upper lobe collapse.  Left lower opacities better charachterized on
 subsequent CT.
 3.  Spiculated right upper lobe mass, better charachterized on subsequent CT.
