                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumohemothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change in the appearance of the extensive upper lobe collapse on the
 left with areas of apparent pleural fluid as well as what appears to be a
 rectangular collection of pneumothorax.  Substantial shift of the trachea to
 the left is consistent with volume loss.  In the right lung, there is an
 ill-defined area of opacification, consistent with a spiculated mass that is
 better characterized on subsequent CT scan.
