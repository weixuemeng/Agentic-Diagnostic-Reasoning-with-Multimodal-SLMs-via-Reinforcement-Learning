                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  There remains complete collapse of the left upper lobe, known to be
 post-obstructive in this patient with history of central left lung cancer. 
 Left lower lobe consolidation may represent an infectious pneumonia given
 appearance on recent CT of two days earlier.  Within the right lung,
 interstitial edema is present as well as a known cavitary mass in the right
 upper lobe.
