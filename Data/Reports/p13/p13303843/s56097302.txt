                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with multiple rib fractures with elevated white
 count.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained of the patient in
 the upright position. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.  CT chest with
 contrast on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Persistent left upper lobe opacity consistent with left upper lobe collapse. 
 Increasing left lower lobe opacities suggestive of possible aspiration,
 atelectasis or new pneumonia.  Known right upper lobe mass is more fully
 characterized on CT. Persistent left pleural effusion.  Left pneumothorax no
 longer detected.  Port-A-Cath remains in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Left upper lobe collapse. See recent CT report which described an
 obstructing mass.  
 
 2. Increasing left lower lower lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia. 
 
 3. Right upper lobe mass, more fully characterized on recent CT.
