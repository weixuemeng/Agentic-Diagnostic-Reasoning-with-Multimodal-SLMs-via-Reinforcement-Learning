                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with dyspnea, elevated white blood
 count, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  Similar as on the preceding
 examination, there is almost a complete left-sided pulmonary whiteout in this
 patient who on recent chest CT showed large mass in left upper lobe area and
 almost complete atelectasis of left lower lobe.  The right hemithorax
 demonstrates mostly well aerated pulmonary structures; however, in the apical
 area there is again evidence of a mass which also has been shown by CT.  There
 is no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrate in comparison with yesterday's
 portable chest examination.  For detail of pulmonary pathology, see CT chest
 report of ___.
