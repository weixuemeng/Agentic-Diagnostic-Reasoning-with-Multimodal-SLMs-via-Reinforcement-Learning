                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall and syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Slight
 prominence of the hila most likely relates to pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 There are degenerative changes along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.
