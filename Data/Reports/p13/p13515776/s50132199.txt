                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent COPD exacerbation p/w worsening SOB  //
 eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.
 
 Heart size at the upper limits of normal.  There is subsegmental atelectasis
 and/or scarring at both lung bases.  This likely accounts for the small focal
 patchy opacity seen at the left lung base laterally, which is similar to the
 ___ radiograph.  Again noted is curvilinear scarring, possibly a
 bulla, posterior to the heart on the lateral view.
 
 No CHF, focal consolidation, gross effusion, or pneumothorax detected.  Mild
 anterior wedging of an upper thoracic vertebral body, question T4, is
 unchanged compared with ___.  Mild anterior wedging of several lower
 thoracic vertebral bodies is better visualized on targeted review of a ___ CT scan.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD, when bibasilar atelectasis and/or scarring.
 
 No focal infiltrate identified to suggest pneumonia.  Otherwise, no acute
 pulmonary process identified.
