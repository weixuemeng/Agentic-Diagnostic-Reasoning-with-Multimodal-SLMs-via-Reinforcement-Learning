                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Exam is limited by respiratory motion and low lung volumes.  The
 heart size appears mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.  Mild
 atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Focal opacity projecting over the
 medial aspect of the right lung base is noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Marked
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity projecting over the right medial lung base, for which
 dedicated PA and lateral views are recommended when the patient is able to
 ascertain if this reflects a focal consolidation in the lung.
