 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Temporal lobe stroke, fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 both lung bases.  No pulmonary edema.  Minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus might be caused by a small pleural effusion.
