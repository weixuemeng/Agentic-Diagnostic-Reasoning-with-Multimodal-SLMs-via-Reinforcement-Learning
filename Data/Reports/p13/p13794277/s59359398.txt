                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except for minimal
 patchy and linear opacities at the bases, most likely due to atelectasis,
 although aspiration could have a similar radiographic appearance.
