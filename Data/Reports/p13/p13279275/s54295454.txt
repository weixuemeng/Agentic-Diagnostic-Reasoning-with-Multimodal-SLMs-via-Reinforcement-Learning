  Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which are likely representative
  of atelectasis. However, an overlying early infectious process cannot be
  excluded. Continued followup recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cholecystectomy, productive cough, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Better seen on the lateral than on
 the frontal radiograph are bilateral lower lobe parenchymal opacities,
 predominating in the peribronchial components of the lung parenchyma.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, these changes are suspicious for pneumonia.  No
 evidence of complications, notably no pleural effusions.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.  Status
 post healed right clavicular fracture.
 
 At the time of image acquisition, a wet read was delivered.
