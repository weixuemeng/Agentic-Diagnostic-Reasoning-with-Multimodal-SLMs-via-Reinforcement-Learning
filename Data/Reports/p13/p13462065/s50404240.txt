                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
 re-intubation  // re-intubation; s/p bronch with mucous plugging     
 re-intubation; s/p bronch with mucous plugging
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 19:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright chest radiograph ___ at 13:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema.  The left
 basilar pigtail pleural catheter remains in place.  Overall, loculated left
 apical, medial and basilar pneumothorax has decreased in overall size.  The
 previously seen linear lucency at the right base is no longer apparent
 although there may be a very tiny right apical pneumothorax.  There is
 improved aeration at the left base with residual patchy atelectasis.  Right
 lung is grossly clear.  Stable linear lucency adjacent to the descending aorta
 is suggestive of pneumomediastinum.
 
 Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately
 4.5 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular central line and
 nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  A biliary stent is incompletely
 visualized.
