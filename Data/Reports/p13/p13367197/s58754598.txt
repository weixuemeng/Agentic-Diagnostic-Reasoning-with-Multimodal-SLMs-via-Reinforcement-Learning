                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after liver transplantation
 with dry irritative cough and night sweats.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Fullness of pulmonary arteries
 is noted, unchanged.  Questionable retrocardiac opacity is seen that
 potentially may reflect atelectasis, though given patient's symptoms,
 infectious process in the lower lobe (unclear right or left) is noted.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
