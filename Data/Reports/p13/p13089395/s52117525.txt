 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever on POD#0 from evacuation of
 hemoperitoneum on POD#2 from abdominal myomectomy. Now temp ___.2, of note pt

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe bibasilar consolidation is probably accompanied by small to moderate
 pleural effusion. Whether the pulmonary abnormality is atelectasis,
 atelectasis due to aspiration, or early developing pneumonia is
 radiographically indeterminate, particularly without information concern the
 interval since recent surgery. Interstitial pulmonary edema is also present.
 Heart is normal size and mediastinal drains are not dilated, suggesting that
 it is within volume overload had been responsible for edema, it is no longer
 present, or patient is now hypotensive.
