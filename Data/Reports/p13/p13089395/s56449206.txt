                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased oxygen requirement and chest pain.After 8 units PRBC in
 last three days, question pulmonary edema and ARDS.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 18:10 p.m.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is minimally unfolded.  There are small
 bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation of both lung
 bases.  Allowing for differences in positioning, the effusions are better
 defined.  There has been considerable interval improvement in CHF findings,
 with essentially no residual CHF identified at this time.  Minor thickening of
 the minor fissure is noted, but no significant upper zone redistribution or
 vascular plethora is detected.  There is asymmetry of the breast shadows on
 this exam, but this may be an artifact of positioning.  This was not present
 on the earlier film. 
 
 Unusual linear lucency adjacent to left aortic knob appears non-physiologic
 and likely represents artifact.  No suggestion of pneumothorax on the lateral
 view.
 
 IMPRESION:
 1) No CHF.    
 2) Small-to-moderate effusions with underlying collapse or consolidation at
 both bases.  The effusions are probably slightly larger.  Bibasilar changes
 are different in configuration but overall similar.  Possibility of underlying
 pneumonic infiltrate, however, cannot be excluded.
