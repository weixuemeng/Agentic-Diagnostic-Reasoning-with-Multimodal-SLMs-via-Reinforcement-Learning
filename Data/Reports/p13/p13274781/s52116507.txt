                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain  // ? chf
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. 
 Nonvisualization of the cardiac apex most likely reflects the presence of a
 cardiac fat pad.  Aorta is minimally unfolded.  Right paratracheal soft tissue
 density is noted, but likely reflects vascular structures. There is equivocal
 minimal upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  There mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or effusion is identified. 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Small focus of hydroxyapatite it is seen adjacent to the left shoulder,
 consistent with calcific tendinitis, of indeterminate acuity.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Heart size at upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.
 2. Minimal basilar atelectasis.
 3. Possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF, frank
 consolidation, or effusion detected.
 4. If clinically indicated, PA and lateral radiographs could help to further
 assess the left base atelectasis and mediastinal contours.
