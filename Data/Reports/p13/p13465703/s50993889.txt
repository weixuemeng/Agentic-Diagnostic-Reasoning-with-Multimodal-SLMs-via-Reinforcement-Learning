                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is top normal. The lung
 volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is mild.  What looks like a 2.5cm oval lung nodule or calcification on the
 lateral view, could be a pulmonary vein; oblique views would clarify that.
 There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 Moderate degenerative changes are seen within the glenohumeral joints
 bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Very low lung volumes.  No large consolidation or effusion
 detected. Oblique views would be required to exclude a pulmonary nodule.
