                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman who underwent routine cxr for work TB
 screening, had a positive ppd, and a cxr which noted "mild left CP angle
 blunting which may be chronic"  // Confirm findings, and next steps
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Both lungs are well inflated.  The blunt left costophrenic angle previously
 described in prior study is again seen and unchanged.  This likely reflects
 left lower lung subpleural parenchymal scarring seen on ___ chest CT.
 There is no effusion seen on lateral view. There are no consolidation, 
 masses, nor pneumothorax.   The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 silhouettes are normal.. There is no acute bony abnormality nor evidence of
 acute fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  When compared to ___ chest radiograph, the blunt left
 costophrenic angle is again seen. This likely reflects left lower lung
 subpleural parenchymal scarring seen on ___ chest CT.
 2. No pleural effusions seen on lateral view.  This is a normal chest
