                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 grossly clear.  Minimal blunting of left lateral costophrenic sulcus appears
 unchanged and probably reflects pleural thickening, although a small pleural
 effusion could produce a similar radiographic appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Lateral left costophrenic angle blunting, which likely represents pleural
 thickening and less likely a small pleural effusion.
