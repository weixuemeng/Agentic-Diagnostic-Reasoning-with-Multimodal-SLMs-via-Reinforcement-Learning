                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough and blood-tinged sputum, recent rib
 fractures, SPO2 ___% on RA  // eval for pna vs. hemothorax, please complete in
 AM     eval for pna vs. hemothorax, please complete in AM
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 02:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest ___ at 08:18 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain markedly diminished with crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature.  There are bibasilar opacities, left greater than right,
 suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.  The lateral view raises the
 possibility of bilateral layering effusions, although this is somewhat
 difficult to ascertain with certainty given the body habitus and patient
 positioning.  If of clinical concern, CT may be more helpful to delineate the
 degree of pleural fluid versus parenchymal consolidation.  No pneumothorax. 
 No evidence of pulmonary edema.
