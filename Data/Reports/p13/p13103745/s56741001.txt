                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Previously noted right basilar opacification has markedly improved, with near
 complete resolution of the right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar streaky
 opacities could reflect atelectasis with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement
 noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Near-complete resolution of the previously noted right basilar opacity and
 pleural effusion.
 
 2. Streaky and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
