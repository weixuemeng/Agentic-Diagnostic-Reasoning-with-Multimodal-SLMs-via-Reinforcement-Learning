                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hepatic hydrothorax status post cirrhosis and abnormal right lung
 findings, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes are near normal.  On the right, a relatively large
 and partly loculated pleural effusion is seen.  Effusion has a ventral and
 dorsal component at the bases of the lungs and an intrafissural component at
 the level of the minor fissure.  Adjacent to the effusion are areas of
 atelectasis.  
 
 The well ventilated lung parenchyma, however, is unremarkable.  The heart
 appears to be normal in size.  There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
