                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath, history of cirrhosis,
 ascites, and pleural effusion.  Assess for hydrothorax, pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently portable AP radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is now increased
 partial collapse of the right middle lobe and worsening atelectasis/collapse
 of the right lower lobe.  Hazy opacity in the right middle lung zone and
 prominence of the fissures suggest increased pleural fluid; however, it is
 difficult to quantify due to the atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to evaluate also due to atelectasis.  The left lung is clear.  There
 is no pneumothorax or acute skeletal abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased partial collapse of right middle lobe and worsening
 atelectasis/collapse of the right lower lobe.  
 Likely increased right pleural effusion; however, difficult to quantify due to
 the atelectasis.
