                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits normal in
 size accounting for this factor.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are present with some associated volume loss,
 particularly in the right lower lobe with inferior displacement of right hilum
 and right major fissure.  These findings have slightly progressed since the
 prior radiograph.  No definite pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
