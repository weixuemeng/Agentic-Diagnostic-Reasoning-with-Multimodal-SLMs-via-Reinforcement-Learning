                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:37 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hepatic encephalopathy requiring tube
 feedings.  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to earlier on ___:
 
 Feeding tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced at
 least 10 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are engorged, all suggesting
 volume overload, though I doubt that pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural
 effusion is present.  Right jugular line ends in the upper mid SVC.
