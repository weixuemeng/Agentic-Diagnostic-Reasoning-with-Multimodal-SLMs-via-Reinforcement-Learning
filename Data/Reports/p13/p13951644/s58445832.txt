                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:53 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 5:04 p.m.:
 
 Feeding tube with the wire stylet withdrawn several centimeters from the tip
 ends in the upper stomach, after repositioning.  I cannot tell whether there
 is still a loop of tubing in the hypopharynx.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  Heart is mildly enlarged and
 mediastinal veins are engorged.  Pulmonary vasculature is also engorged and
 with lung volumes so low, it is difficult to say whether the patient is on the
 verge of pulmonary edema.
