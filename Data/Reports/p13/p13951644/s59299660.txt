                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post Dobbhoff tube placement.  Assess for positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid
 SVC.  A Dobbhoff tube is seen ending within the upper portion of the stomach,
 although the proximal portion of its floppy end is in the distal esophagus. 
 Previously, the entirety of the Dobbhoff tube ended within the lower
 esophagus.  Lung volumes remain very low, although slightly improved compared
 to the prior study from ___.  There is minimal bilateral lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely at
 least partially attributable to low lung volumes.  The mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dobbhoff tube has been slightly advanced, although a portion of its floppy
 tip continues to end in the distal esophagus.  Recommend advancing.
 
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes with subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 4:52 p.m. via
 telephone on the day of the study, immediately after discovery of the finding.
