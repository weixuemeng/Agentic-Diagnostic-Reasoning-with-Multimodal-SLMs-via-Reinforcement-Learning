                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:39 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has increased and there is new bibasilar alveolar
 opacities that are more prominent in the left lower lobe.  Part of this is
 explained by pulmonary edema; however, aspiration and pneumonia could be
 considered.  Pleural effusion is hard to assess. Patient with prior
 sternotomy.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  ET tube is in adequate
 position.  The end of the NG tube is hard to see.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema has increased.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities have also increased mostly in left lower lobe where
 pneumonia and aspiration have to be considered.  
 
 This has been discussed with Dr. ___.  Suspicious secretion for pneumonia was
 found during bronchoscopy.
