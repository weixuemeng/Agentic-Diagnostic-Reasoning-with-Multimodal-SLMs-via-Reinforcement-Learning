                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with chest pain  // eval for infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   A nodular opacity projecting
 over the right upper lung appears bilobed and measures approximately ___.5 mm
 in maximal dimension.  In the absence of prior imaging studies, a nonemergent
 chest CT may be obtained to exclude underlying nodule.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear without signs of pneumonia or edema.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No signs of pneumonia or edema.  Nodular opacity projecting over the right
 upper lung measuring up to ___.5 mm, indeterminate, requires further evaluation
 with nonemergent chest CT.
