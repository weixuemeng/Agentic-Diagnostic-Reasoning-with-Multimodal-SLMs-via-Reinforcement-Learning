                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with hip pain.  Infectious workup.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is calcified.  There is an eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, which
 is elevated anteriorly, similar to prior findings.  Right basilar opacities
 associated with the large hiatal hernia appear increased, but were already
 present to some extent before and are typical for atelectasis associated with
 a large hiatal hernia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Moderate reverse S-shaped curvature to the
 visualized thoracolumbar spine appear similar to the prior examination,
 including suspected but incompletely characterized degenerative changes,
 probably at least moderate in severity.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Large hiatal
 hernia.
