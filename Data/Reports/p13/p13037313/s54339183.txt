                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pleural effusion, hypoxia, please evaluate for size of
 the effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large left-sided pleural effusion obscuring the left
 heart border. There is a lucency which projects over the density, which could
 be suggestive of a loculated effusion, however another source of air cannot be
 excluded. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  No focal consolidations
 concerning for infection are otherwise seen. The lungs bilaterally demonstrate
 nodular densities, likely secondary to granulomas.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.  There is slight contralateral deviation of the
 carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left-sided pleural effusion with areas of lucency
 projecting over the density. This could be suggestive of a loculated effusion,
 however another source of air cannot be excluded. A PA and lateral radiograph
 would be helpful for further evaluation.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:___p by telephone by Dr. ___
 ___ on the day of the exam.
