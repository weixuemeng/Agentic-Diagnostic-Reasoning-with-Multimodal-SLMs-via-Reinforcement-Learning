                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size since the
 post-thoracentesis radiograph of ___ is now similar in appearance
 to the pre-thoracentesis radiograph from that date.  Hiatal hernia with
 intrathoracic stomach is again demonstrated as well as elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm with adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Within the
 right lung, a confluent ground-glass opacity has developed just above the
 minor fissure level, and could reflect either aspiration or early focus of
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Reaccumulation of moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis
 and/or consolidation.
 2.  New peripheral ground-glass opacity in right upper lobe, which could be
 due to aspiration or developing infection.
 3.  Decreased small right pleural effusion.
