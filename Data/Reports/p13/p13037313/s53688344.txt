                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower extremity redness and bilateral lower extremity swelling
 left greater than right.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again noted is a intrathoracic stomach on the left side with a small left
 pleural effusion and adjacent opacification of the left lung base likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to assess given
 the presence of this intrathoracic stomach.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 There is mild pulmonary edema.  Trace right pleural effusion is also noted,
 which appears new compared to the prior radiograph.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  A left-sided
 intrathoracic stomach with adjacent atelectasis, similar appearance compared
 to the prior exam.
