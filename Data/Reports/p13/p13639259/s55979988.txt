                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Diffuse interstitial opacities with
 bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening more prominent in the lung bases
 appear similar to prior examination.  Additionally, lungs remain severely
 hyperinflated likely related to underlying obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Previously seen opacification in the retrocardiac region appears improved from
 prior.  However, there is a persistent opacity and a small left pleural
 effusion.  Septal thickening is re-demonstrated, however, appears similar to
 multiple prior examinations and may be due to chronic edema or chronic
 parenchymal lung disease.  No definite new opacity is identified to suggest
 acute pneumonia or aspiration.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Cervical spinal
 hardware is partially imaged and appears within normal limits. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening with underlying emphysematous
 changes, similar to prior.
 2.  Prominent interstitial opacities and septal thickening which may be due to
 chronic superimposed mild edema or related to underlying chronic lung disease.
 3.  Improved aeration of the left lung base though with a persistent opacity
 and a small left pleural effusion.
 4.  No convincing evidence of new consolidation to suggest interval aspiration
 or pneumonia.
