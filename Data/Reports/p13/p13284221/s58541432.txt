                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old smoker with COPD and cough for a month.  Right lower
 lobe expiratory rhonchi.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe hyperinflation is chronic.  There are no focal pulmonary abnormalities.
 Mild eventration of the left hemidiaphragm posteriorly is also chronic.  Heart
 size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 A slight increase in the attenuation of obliquely oriented tissue crossing the
 medial right clavicle could be due to greater prominence of the head and neck
 vessels, but given the patient's clinical history and risk factors, deserves
 CT scanning to exclude a subtle lung mass.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Thoracic aorta is prominent only because of the
 hyperlucency of the lungs and relatively mild calcification.  Findings were
 posted to the online record of critical radiology findings for purposes of
 direct notification of the referring physician, at the time of this dictation.
