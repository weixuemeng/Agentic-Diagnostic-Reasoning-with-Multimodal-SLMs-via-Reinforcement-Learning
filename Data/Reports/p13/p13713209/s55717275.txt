                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Enlargement of
 the pulmonary artery is again noted bilaterally compatible with pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflects small bilateral pleural
 effusions, decreased from the previous study.  No pneumothorax is present. 
 Deformity of the right seventh anterolateral rib appears new in the interval,
 but potentially subacute.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased from the previous exam.
 2. Enlargement of the pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 3. Mild deformity of the right seventh anterolateral rib appears new in the
 interval, but may be subacute in nature.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
