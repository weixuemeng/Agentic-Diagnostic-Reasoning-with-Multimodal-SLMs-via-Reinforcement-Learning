                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  History of small cell lung cancer involving the left
 suprahilar region, now with low-grade temp and previous history of pneumonia,
 question infection.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at ___ are submitted and
 compared to a prior study of ___ at 929.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.  Lungs are well inflated. 
 There is a subtle patchy opacity in the left base which is somewhat linear in
 configuration which favors partial lobar atelectasis rather than pneumonia. 
 However, clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be
 performed based on the clinical assessment.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces are seen.  The left hilum superiorly remains mildly prominent
 but is stable and this is known to correspond to the area of a previous
 malignancy first imaged in ___.  No acute bony abnormality is
 appreciated.
