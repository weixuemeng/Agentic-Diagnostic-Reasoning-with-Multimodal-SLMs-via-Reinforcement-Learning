                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer with fevers.  Possible opacity seen on
 portable film.  Reevaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right lung is clear without consolidation.  The previously seen
 equivocal opacity was likely from superimposed normal vessels in the setting
 of low lung volumes.  The left hilum remains mildly prominent due to patient's
 known tumor, but is much improved from the previous chest radiograph on
 ___.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The size of
 the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
