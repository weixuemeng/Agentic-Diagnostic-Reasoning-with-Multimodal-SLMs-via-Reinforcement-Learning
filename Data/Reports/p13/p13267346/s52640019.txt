                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with lupus, interstitial lung disease, and
 esophageal dysmotility presenting with ___ chest pain radiating to the back
 as well as shortness of breath.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process causing
 the patient's chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Persistent basilar predominant interstitial lung disease as evaluated on
 recent chest CT.  No focal consolidation, effusion, edema, or pneumothorax. 
 The heart remains mildly enlarged.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on the
 recent chest CT are not as well appreciated on this radiograph.  A hiatal
 hernia is small. No acute osseous abnormality.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes in the thoracic spine are mild.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar interstitial lung disease has been more fully characterized by a
 recent CT.  No definite superimposed secondary process such as pneumonia,
 although subtle new abnormalities may be difficult to detect in the setting of
 chronic lung disease.
