 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 3:19 PM
  
  1. Bibasilar interstitial lung disease, better characterized on prior CT chest
  ___.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
  3. Minimal apparent angulation of the left lateral seventh rib may reflect a
  fracture dislocation.  Correlate with focal pain on physical exam at this
  location.
  4. Otherwise, no displaced rib fracture noted.  Note that chest radiography is
  not sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib fractures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year female with epigastric pain following a motor vehicle
 accident, evaluate for free air or rib fractures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:
 1. Chest x-ray ___.
 2. CT Chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There may be mild unchanged cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects
 basilar atelectasis.  Bibasilar interstitial abnormality was better
 characterized on prior CT chest from ___.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear without new focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Minimal angulation of a left lateral rib, likely the
 seventh rib, is noted without a discrete fracture line.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bibasilar interstitial lung disease, better characterized on prior CT chest
 ___.  No superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 3. Minimal apparent angulation of the left lateral seventh rib may reflect a
 fracture dislocation.  Correlate with focal pain on physical exam at this
 location.
 4. Otherwise, no displaced rib fracture noted.  Note that chest radiography is
 not sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib fractures.
