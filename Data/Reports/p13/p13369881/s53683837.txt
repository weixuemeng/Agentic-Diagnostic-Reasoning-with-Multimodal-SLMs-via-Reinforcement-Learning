                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen throughout the chest wall bilaterally
 and extending into the neck and abdominal wall bilaterally.  Right-sided chest
 tube is noted with tip terminating near the right lung base.  The heart size
 is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pneumomediastinum is noted.  Hilar
 contours are unremarkable. No shift of mediastinal structures is noted.  There
 is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Assessment of the lung parenchyma is
 limited due to the extensive subcutaneous emphysema.  There is a suggestion of
 a right basilar patchy opacity peripherally, which is nonspecific.  Small
 right apical pneumothorax is likely present.  Assessment for left-sided
 pneumothorax is limited, though a small left apical pneumothorax may be
 present.  Displaced right ___ posterior rib fracture is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the chest and neck. 
 Pneumomediastinum with likely small right pneumothorax.  A left apical
 pneumothorax may be present, though assessment is limited.  Patchy opacity in
 the right lung base is non-specific, possibly an area of contusion.  Displaced
 right 7th rib fracture.
