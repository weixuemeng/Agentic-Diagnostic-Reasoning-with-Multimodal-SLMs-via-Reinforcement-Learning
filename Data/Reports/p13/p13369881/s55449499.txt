                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with right rib fracture and pneumothorax after
 chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  The small right pneumothorax
 unchanged despite right pleural tube, crossing the right mid chest laterally
 and terminating along the posterior costal surface.  Large pneumomediastinum
 and extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the thoracoabdominal wall and
 neck is all stable.  It would be very important to evaluate any chest imaging
 done prior to the only two studies we have here ___ and today, to see
 where the subcutaneous emphysema originated, and whether predated insertion of
 the right pleural tube.
 
 There are multiple right lower rib fractures, none severely displaced.  There
 is no good evidence for intrathoracic bleeding, specifically no pleural
 effusion or particular consolidation in the lung.
