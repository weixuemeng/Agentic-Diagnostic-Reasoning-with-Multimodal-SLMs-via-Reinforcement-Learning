                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the right
 chest tube has been removed.  The degree of pneumothorax is either stable or
 slightly improved.  The subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall,
 across the right thorax, and into the right neck is unchanged.  The
 subcutaneous gas in the left supraclavicular region appears to have improved.
