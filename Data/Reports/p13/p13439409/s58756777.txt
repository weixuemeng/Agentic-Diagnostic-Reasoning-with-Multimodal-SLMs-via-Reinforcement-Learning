 AP portable upright view of the chest.   The patient's chin obscures the lung
 apices in the superior mediastinum.  A left chest wall AICD is seen with leads
 extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The heart

 due to obscuration limit assessment of the lungs.  Allowing for this, there is
 no overt evidence for pneumonia or edema.
