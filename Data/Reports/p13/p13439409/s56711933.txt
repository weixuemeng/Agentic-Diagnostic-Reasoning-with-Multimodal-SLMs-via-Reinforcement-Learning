                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/pmh sCHF (EF ___% per echo ___), AF on Coumadin, ICD
 for h/o VT/VF (___) p/w lethargy, waxing/waning mental status and
 tachypnea, ultimately requiring intubation and admission to the CCU.
 Diuresing, remains intubated.  // eval for interval change in pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, there is now near complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax with mild leftward shift of the
 cardiomediastinal contours, even allowing for patient rotation.  This appears
 to be due to a combination of enlarging left pleural effusion and substantial
 atelectasis of the left lung.  Interval repositioning of endotracheal tube,
 now terminating 3.2 cm above the carina.  Apparent decrease in size of right
 pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar opacity.  Pulmonary edema is
 unchanged allowing for differences in lung volumes.  At the time of this
 dictation, a subsequent chest radiograph has been performed demonstrating
 improvement of the left lung abnormality, thus precluding the need for
 notification.
