                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated  // tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 14:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval intubation has occurred with tip of the endotracheal tube low lying,
 terminating approximately 1.7 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube courses
 into the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Left-sided
 AICD device is again noted with leads in unchanged positions.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is again noted.  Lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion re- demonstrated.  More focal retrocardiac and right
 perihilar opacities could reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lying endotracheal tube with tip approximately 1.7 cm from the carina. 
 Recommend slight interval withdrawal by approximately 2 cm.
 2. Enteric tube in standard position.
 3. Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 4. Right perihilar and left retrocardiac patchy opacities may reflect
 atelectasis.
