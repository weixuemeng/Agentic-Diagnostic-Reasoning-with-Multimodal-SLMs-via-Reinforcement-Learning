 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of earlier the same date, the left lung demonstrates
 markedly improved aeration, likely due to resolution of the mucous plug. 
 Residual partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe is demonstrated.  Stable
 cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and persistent
 pulmonary edema.  Small to moderate right and small left pleural effusions are
 also noted.  No visible pneumothorax.
