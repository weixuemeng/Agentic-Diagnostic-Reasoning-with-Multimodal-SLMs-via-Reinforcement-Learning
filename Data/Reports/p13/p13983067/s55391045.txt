 of which demonstrate areas of central lucency and are compatible with the
 patient's known multifocal septic pulmonary emboli.  More confluent
 consolidation in the right lung base has partially improved, and a right
 pleural effusion has decreased in size. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
