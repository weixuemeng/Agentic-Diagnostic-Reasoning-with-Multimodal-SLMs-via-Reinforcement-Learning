                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from ___ and a chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The heart is top
 normal in size.  Subtle opacity in the right lung base medially on the frontal
 projection could represent vascular crowding, less likely pneumonia.  The left
 lung is clear.  Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable.  No pneumothorax
 or effusion.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal heart size with vague opacity at the right medial lung
 base which could represent bronchovascular crowding, less likely pneumonia.
