 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs appear hyperinflated and
 lucent with a linear opacity in the left lower lung which is most compatible
 with scarring.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No congestion or edema.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour unremarkable.  Degenerative changes are notable at the
 left glenohumeral joint.  Otherwise the bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable scarring in the left lower lung with emphysema/COPD.
 No convincing evidence for pneumonia.
