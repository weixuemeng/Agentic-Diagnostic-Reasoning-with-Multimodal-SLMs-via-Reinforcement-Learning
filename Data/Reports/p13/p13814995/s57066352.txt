 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 evidence for dilatation.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs appear clear.  Minimal marginal osteophyte formation is seen along the
 thoracic spine.
