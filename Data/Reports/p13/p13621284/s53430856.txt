                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension status post intubation access or worsening pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 substantially better inspiration.  Cardiac size is within normal limits.  No
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  The areas of opacification in the
 infrahilar regions, especially on the left, are not appreciated, most likely
 reflecting the better inspiration.  
 
 There is still some prominence in the azygos region, though no definite
 engorgement of pulmonary vessels in the central or peripheral areas.
