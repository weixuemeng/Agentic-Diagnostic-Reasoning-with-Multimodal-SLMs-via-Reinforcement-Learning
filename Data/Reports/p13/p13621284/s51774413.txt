                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, intubated.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Meanwhile, the patient was extubated.  Heart size and mediastinal silhouettes
 are stable.  Left lower lobe opacity appears to be increased in the interim
 and might reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or progression of pneumonia
 cannot be excluded in this location.  No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.
 No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
