                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed electively intubated for EGD.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  An ET tube is present.  The tip lies
 approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  There is patchy infrahilar opacity,
 left greater than right, of uncertain etiology or significance, particularly
 in light of low lung volumes.  The possibility of a focal infiltrate or focus
 of aspiration cannot be excluded.  Remainder of both lungs is grossly clear. 
 No effusion or CHF.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Patchy infrahilar opacities, particularly about the left hilum,
 which are new compared with ___.  They were not apparent on a ___ CT
 scan, so, in the absence of intervening pathology, may very well represent
 atelectasis related to low lung volumes. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 the ddx would include aspiration or infectious infiltrate.
