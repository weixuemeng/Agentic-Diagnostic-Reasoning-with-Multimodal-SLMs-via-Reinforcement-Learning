                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp distress  // acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary vascular congestion is
 accompanied by new asymmetrical perihilar opacities, left greater than right,
 most likely due to asymmetrical edema although aspiration is an additional
 consideration.  Bibasilar opacities are again demonstrated with some
 improvement in the right lower lobe and persistence in the left retrocardiac
 region. Small pleural effusions appear slightly larger than on the prior exam
 but positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.
