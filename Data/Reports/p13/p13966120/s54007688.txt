                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal. Aortic knob calcifications are identified. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of COPD. No
 pulmonary vascular engorgement is demonstrated. Streaky opacity in the right
 lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are noted in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggestive of COPD. Streaky right basilar opacity, likely
 atelectasis.
