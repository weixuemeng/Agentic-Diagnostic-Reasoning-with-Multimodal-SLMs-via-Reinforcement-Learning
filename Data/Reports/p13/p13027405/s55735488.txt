                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB, episode of Near syncope.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with right lower lobe
 opacity most consistent with atelectasis.  Left lung is clear.  No left
 pleural effusion.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 No pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures demonstrates a sclerotic focus
 along the anterolateral right eighth rib, unchanged since prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to increased,
 chronic right subpulmonic effusion.
 2.  Right lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Sclerotic focus along anterolateral right eighth rib is unchanged in
 appearance since ___ and likely sequelae of prior rib fracture.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation for superimposed infection is
 recommended.
