                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 Altered mental status. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes resulting
 in bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. However, even given low lung volumes, the heart size appears to be
 mildly increased.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, without a focal
 consolidation.  Emphysematous changes are noted bilaterally. There is no
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, without focal consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
