 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:13 PM
  swan-___ catheter from inferior approach projects in distal right pa, likely
  beyond branches to upper lobe. new ETT approximately 2.7 cm above carina. new
  esophageal catheter with normal course, tip out of view below diaphragm.  the
  transseptal catheter via inferior approach has tip projecting over expected
  region of left atrium. left pacermaker and right CVL unchanged.  diffuse
  opacification of right hemithorax could represent asymmetric edema with areas
  of atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cardiac arrest, now status post Tandem heart
 transplant, intubation, multiple line placement.  Chest x-ray to evaluate for
 lines and tubes.
 
 CHEST PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to prior examination of ___.  The lung
 volumes are low.  The heart size is therefore likely adequate.  There is some
 widening of the mediastinum although again this is likely due to poor
 inspiratory effort.  There is hazy opacity and vascular haziness in both lungs
 consistent with interstitial edema.  An ET tube is identified 3.2 cm from the
 carina in correct position.  A pacemaker lead in the right ventricle and a
 second lead in the right atrium.  There is a subclavian line with its tip in
 the distal SVC.  An NG tube is noted coursing through the esophagus into the
 stomach.  The tip of the NG tube is not identified on this film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tubes and lines in adequate position as described above. 
 2.  Pulmonary edema involving both lungs.
 3.  Widening of the mediastinum and possible cardiomegaly are likely due to
 low lung volumes.
