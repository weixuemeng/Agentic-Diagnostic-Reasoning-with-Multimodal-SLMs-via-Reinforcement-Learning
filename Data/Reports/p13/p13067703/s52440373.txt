                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral crackles and cough in a patient with congestive heart
 failure and advanced lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___; PET CT from ___; and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest once again demonstrate a
 right upper lobe mass with a fiducial marker in place as well as a right
 perihilar mass.  This is consistent with the patient's known malignancy.  Once
 again seen are a small right and moderate left pleural effusion, with
 considerable left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation, which is stable
 from both the prior radiographs and the cross-sectional imaging.  The
 remainder of the lung fields are clear.  The pacemaker/ICD device and its two
 leads are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or decompensated congestive heart
 failure.  Stable findings associated with the patient's known lung malignancy.
