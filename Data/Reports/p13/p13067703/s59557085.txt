                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recurrent chest pain.  Question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CTA dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral
 cardiac pacer with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 The heart is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  There are increased perihilar streaky opacities, which
 suggests pulmonary edema.  Right suprahilar pulmonary mass is redemonstrated,
 better correlated on cross-sectional imaging.  There is dense retrocardiac
 probable atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  Small left effusion.
