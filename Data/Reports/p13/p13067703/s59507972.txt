                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of lung carcinoma and left
 pleural effusion with decreased breath sounds and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker terminates with leads in the proper
 position.  Chain sutures along the right lung base are again noted and appear
 stable.
 
 Again visualized is a loculated small left pleural effusion as well as a small
 right pleural effusion, appearing stable in comparison to prior study.  There
 is a new confluent patchy opacity in left lower lobe in comparison to the
 prior study, which may be representative of developing pneumonia.  Otherwise,
 the remainder of the lungs is clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains
 stable.  The visualized osseous structures are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable small loculated left and small right pleural effusions.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in the left lower lobe may be representative of
 developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
