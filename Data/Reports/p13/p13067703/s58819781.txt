 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Previously
 described heart size, mediastinal structures, and permanent pacer with dual
 electrode system remain unchanged.  The same holds also with the previously
 described loculated pleural effusion that blunts the left-sided lateral
 pleural sinus.  Parenchymal densities in the posterior portion of the left
 lower lobe remain unchanged as they present on the lateral view.  The only
 significant difference is the appearance of substantial amount of
 subdiaphragmatic air which was not found on the preceding chest examination. 
 Telephone contact with referring physician, ___. ___, explained this
 finding as the patient is daily abdominal dialysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  Persistent loculated pleural density on
 the left base and parenchymal density occupying posterior portions of the left
 lower lobe.
