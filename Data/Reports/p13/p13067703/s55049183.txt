                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer and acute congestive heart failure
 exacerbation.  Patient complains of dyspnea and also has end-stage renal
 disease, on peritoneal dialysis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A pacemaker/ICD device with two leads appears unchanged.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The pacer device
 overlaps persistent opacification of the left costophrenic angle that is
 probably unchanged, however, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis
 and a small loculated pleural effusion.  There is persistent thickening of the
 minor fissure with possible fluid and atelectasis with a small right-sided
 pleural effusion.  Nodular suprahilar opacification on the right is associated
 with treated malignancy with an associated fiducial seed and appears stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Free air is no longer apparent on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild fluid overload including pleural
 effusions, but no definite superimposed process.
