                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A dual-lead
 left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The right costophrenic angle is not
 fully included on the image.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, which may
 be at least partially loculated.
 
 Right upper lobe/suprahilar opacity underlying fiducial seed has increased
 since the prior study, raising concern for progression of malignancy.  Streaky
 right infrahilar opacity underlying chain sutures, may relate to chronic
 changes, although appears to have increased since the prior study.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased nodular opacity in the medial right apex/right suprahilar region
 underlying fiducial seeds, worrisome for progression of malignancy.
 2.  Bilateral left greater than right pleural effusion, which is likely
 loculated at least on the left.
 3.  Right infrahilar streaky opacity may relate to prior surgery/chronic
 changes but more acute component not excluded.
