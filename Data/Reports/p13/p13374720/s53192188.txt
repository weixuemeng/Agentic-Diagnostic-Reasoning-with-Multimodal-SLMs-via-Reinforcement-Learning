 of liver transplant with question of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal

 lung base.  The lungs are otherwise well aerated, without evidence of
 pneumothorax, confluent consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Mild deformity along the lateral posterior aspect of the right
 ninth rib is compatible with a healed fracture.
