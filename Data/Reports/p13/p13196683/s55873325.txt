                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough x 1 week.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are hyperexpanded suggesting
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top normal with tortuous
 intrathoracic aorta.  Fullness of the right paratracheal stripe is unchanged
 over multiple prior studies and likely reflects prominent vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
