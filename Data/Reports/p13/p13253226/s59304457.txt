                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status, on Coumadin.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Right chest wall dual-lead pacing device is again seen.  There
 is retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the descending thoracic aorta.  This
 could potentially be due to atelectasis given lower lung volumes; however,
 consolidation is not excluded.  Elsewhere, lungs are grossly clear noting
 lower lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes on the current exam.  Left lower lobe opacity
 seen medially, potentially due to atelectasis; however, infiltrate is not
 completely excluded.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
