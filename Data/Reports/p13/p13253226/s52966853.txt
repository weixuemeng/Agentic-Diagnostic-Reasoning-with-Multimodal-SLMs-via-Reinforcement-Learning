                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with AMS, tenderness over L spine, hx of prostate Ca.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Two views of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable and unchanged since the prior
 examination.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly indistinct with
 cephalization.  The bilateral hila are mildly prominent, though no definite
 consolidation is identified.  Midline sternal wires are well aligned and
 intact.  A cardiac stent is noted.  There has been prior valve replacement. 
 Right-sided pacemaker leads are unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Linear atelectasis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization is
 suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  No definite osseous metastases identified.
