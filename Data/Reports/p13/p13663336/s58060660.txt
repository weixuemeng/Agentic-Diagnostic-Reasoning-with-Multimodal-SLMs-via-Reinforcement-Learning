                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia, confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size appears mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Hilar contours are not enlarged. 
 Linear opacities within the right middle lobe are compatible with subsegmental
 atelectasis.  While there is a suggestion of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, no frank pulmonary edema is seen.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine with osteophyte formation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no evidence for
 pneumonia.
