                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pneumonia, hypoxia now  // ? appearance of
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is new complete opacification of the right hemi thorax with rightward
 shift of mediastinal structures, findings compatible with right lung collapse.
 There is likely a right-sided pleural effusion as well, but not well
 delineated from the right lung collapse.  Previously demonstrated right
 basilar pneumonia is not well assessed.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate
 but likely unchanged.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Left lung is hyperinflated with emphysematous
 changes again noted.  A small left pleural effusion is not substantially
 changed.  No left-sided focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium right ventricle.  Right PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Complete opacification of the right hemithorax with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures compatible with right lung collapse.  Right pleural
 effusion and right basilar pneumonia likely persist, but cannot be assessed on
 the current exam.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
