                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, concern for pna and effusion on OSH
 xray  // eval for pna and effusion      eval for pna and effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is substantial opacification in the right
 hemithorax with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm and a relatively small amount
 of aerated lung in the upper zone.  No definite displacement of mediastinal
 contents, suggesting that this represents large pleural effusion with
 compensatory volume loss.  In the appropriate clinical setting, however, it
 would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia.
 No evidence of appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion.  Mild atelectatic
 changes at the left base.
 Left subclavian pacer is in place with leads extending to the right atrium and
 apex of the right ventricle.
