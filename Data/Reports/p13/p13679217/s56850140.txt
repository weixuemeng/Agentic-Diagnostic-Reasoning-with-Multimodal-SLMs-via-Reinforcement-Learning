                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with fever and pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs with the most recent from ___, CTA
 chest from ___, and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear with no evidence of a consolidation, effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  A circular density is noted at the right hilum and
 nonspecific but possibly representative of confluence of vessels. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median sternotomy wires appear
 intact.  There is no free air noted under the hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Rounded opacity in the right hilum and possibly representative of a
 confluence of pulmonary vascular markings.  However, dedicated PA and lateral
 chest radiographs are recommended for further evaluation.
