                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female post total colectomy, leukocytosis.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  A right internal jugular catheter again
 terminates in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube has been removed.  New streaky
 opacities in the left lower lobe, with adjacent small pleural effusion.  Again
 seen are mild cardiomegaly and highly tortuous aorta.  Prosthetic aortic valve
 is in place.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacities and small effusion.  This is suggestive
 of early pneumonia.
