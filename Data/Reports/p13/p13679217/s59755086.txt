                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  The patient is status post total abdominal colectomy with
 tachycardia.  Assess fluid status.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the
 mid-to-lower SVC.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
 allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Mild vascular
 congestion is new .  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, have
 increased.  This could be due to atelectasis.  A superimposed infection cannot
 be totally excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
