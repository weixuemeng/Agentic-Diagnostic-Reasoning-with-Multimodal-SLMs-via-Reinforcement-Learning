                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A calcification projecting over the lateral
 right mid lung may be due to a bone island in the adjacent seventh rib or a
 parenchymal granuloma but in any case appears as a benign finding and
 unchanged.  Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
