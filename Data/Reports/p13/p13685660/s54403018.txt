                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Again seen
 projecting over the lateral right hemithorax is a 5-mm ovoid ossific/calcific
 structure projecting over the right seventh rib, most likely representing a
 calcified granuloma.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is minimal
 blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle which may be due to low
 lung volumes, although a very trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.  Minimal interstitial edema has improved in the
 interval.  There are partially imaged degenerative changes at the right
 greater than left shoulder joints and also along the spine.
