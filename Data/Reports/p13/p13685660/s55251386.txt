                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess cough or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A calcified
 nodular structure in the right mid lung is stable and likely represents a
 calcified granuloma.  There is mild diffuse increase in reticular interstitial
 markings which could reflect the presence of interstitial edema.  There is no
 lobar consolidation.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild interstitial edema.
