 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior studies dating between ___ and ___
 chest x-ray as well as CT abdomen of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs remain hyperexpanded with attenuation of upper lobe vessels. 
 Cardiomediastinal structures appear relatively diminutive in the setting of
 hyperexpanded lungs, but appear similar to the prior studies.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Hyperexpanded lungs with attenuation of upper lobe vessels, suggesting the
 possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumonia.
