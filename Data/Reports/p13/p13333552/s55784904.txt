                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear relatively hyperexpanded, with increased lucency
 and attenuation of vessels in the upper lobes.  No focal areas of
 consolidation are evident in either lung, and there are no pleural effusions. 
 The heart is not enlarged, and mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs with attenuation of upper lobe vessels, a finding that
 can be seen in the setting of emphysema. These imaging findings overlap with
 other disorders such as asthma.  If the diagnosis is in doubt clinically,
 consider high-resolution chest CT and pulmonary function testing for more
 complete evaluation.
