                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously reported basilar opacities have rapidly improved, with
 minimal residual predominantly linear opacities remaining.  Remainder of lungs
 are clear.  Apparent small bilateral pleural effusions are noted on the
 lateral view.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing
 for patient rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapidly improving bibasilar opacities favor either aspiration or
 atelectasis.
