                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  On coumadin status post MVC.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There are low
 lung volumes.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There
 is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally, which may be due to
 mild pulmonary edema.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
 The lateral ribs are not well assessed due to underpenetration.  If there is
 concern for rib fracture, suggest repeat.
