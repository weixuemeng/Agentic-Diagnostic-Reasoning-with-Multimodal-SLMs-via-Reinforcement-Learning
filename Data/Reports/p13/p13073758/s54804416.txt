                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with worsening abdominal distention.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Heart size
 and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Retrocardiac density is most
 compatible with a hiatal hernia.  Right lung base opacity is small and could
 represent pneumonia or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right lung base opacity, consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac density, most compatible with a hiatal hernia.
