                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleuritic chest pain, severe COPD, L coiling
 for COPD 1 week ago, R coiling remotely, now with L pleuritic chest pain and
 fevers.  Evaluate for PNA, pneumothorax, other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, compatible
 with severe emphysema.  Bilateral endobronchial coils are intact and unchanged
 in position.  Interval increase in infrahilar opacities, particularly in the
 left, as well as lingula may suggest hemorrhage or developing pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinum
 is not widened.
 No pneumothorax or effusion.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is
 likely pleural thickening/scarring. Bilateral apical pleural thickening is
 unchanged.  Slight levoconvex scoliosis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe emphysema
