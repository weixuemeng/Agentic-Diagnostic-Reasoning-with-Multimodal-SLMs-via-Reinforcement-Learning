                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Esophageal cancer presenting with dysphasia possible aspiration
 and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and recent more recent
 PET-CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Vague persistent
 posterior opacification in the right lower lobe suggests residual atelectasis
 or scarring. A consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe appears very
 similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right upper lobe opacity.  Characteristics are not typical for
 metastatic esophageal cancer.  However, persistence of the opacity may suggest
 consideration of diagnoses alternative to infectious pneumonia including
 inflammatory forms of pneumonitis or primary adenocarcinoma.  Short-term
 follow-up chest CT may be helpful for more detailed comparison to the prior CT
 results.
