                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dysphasia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  There is no
 pneumomediastinum.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest
 is hyperinflated.  A focal area of opacification is noted in the right upper
 lobe as well as streaky retrocardiac opacification and vague opacity effacing
 the right lateral costophrenic angle.  Air beneath the right hemidiaphragm is
 consistent with intraluminal air in colon interposed immediately below the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumomediastinum.  Right upper lobe opacity; differential
 considerations pneumonia in the appropriate setting or perhaps a more chronic
 opacity.  Correlation with prior radiographs is recommended in follow-up, if
 available, or alternatively follow-up radiographs within three months to
 reassess.
