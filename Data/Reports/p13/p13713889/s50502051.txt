                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mild asthma presenting with cough for 10 days and acute worsening
 now with fever, body aches, and chest tightness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen. 
 Slight aspiration of the left costophrenic angle on the frontal view is likely
 due to overlying soft tissue as the posterior costophrenic angle is sharp on
 the lateral view.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
