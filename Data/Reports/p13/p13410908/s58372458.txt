                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening shortness of breath and history of COPD
 with oxygen saturation decreased.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is prominence of main pulmonary arteries that
 might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Lung volumes are well
 preserved.  In the left upper lung, there is ill-defined opacity projecting
 over the left upper lobe, grossly unchanged since the prior study and might
 represent potentially calcified plaque.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Hyperinflation is better appreciated on the lateral view.
