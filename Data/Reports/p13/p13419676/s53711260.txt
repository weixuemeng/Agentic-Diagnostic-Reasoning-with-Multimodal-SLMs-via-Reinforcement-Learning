                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated transfer status post hotdog
 aspiration
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating approximately 3 cm from
 the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the
 stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film.  Lung volumes are low.
 Heart size is top normal, accentuated by the low inspiratory lung volumes.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bronchovascular crowding is
 demonstrated without pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis though aspiration cannot be
 excluded. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is
 identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis or
 aspiration.
