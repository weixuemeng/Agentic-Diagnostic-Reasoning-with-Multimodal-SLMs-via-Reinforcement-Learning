 atelectasis or consolidation medially.  Conventional radiographs would be very
 helpful in making that assessment.  The right lung is clear.  Right pleural
 effusion is minimal if any.  Heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.  A right
 subclavian line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
