 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs bilaterally but
 appear most severe overlying the upper lobes.  Lung volumes are relatively
 low.  There is no definite superimposed focal consolidation and the pattern
 appears grossly similar compared to prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Known adenopathy is better seen on prior CT scan.  Posterior left
 rib fractures are noted.  Left breast prosthesis is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic fibrotic changes in the lungs without definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process noting that subtle changes could easily be obscured.
