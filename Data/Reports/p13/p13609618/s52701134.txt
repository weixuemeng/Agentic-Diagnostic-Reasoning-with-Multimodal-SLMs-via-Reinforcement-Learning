  New opacities projecting over the lateral lower left lung may reflect a
  tracking pleural effusion, consolidation, or, given the peripheral location,
  pulmonary infarction from pulmonary embolus.  To evaluate for effusion,
  lateral radiograph would be helpful.  To evaluate for pulmonary embolus, chest
  CTA would be recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Again noted are diffuse, bilateral, coarse,
 interstitial opacities overall not significantly changed compared to the prior
 examination.  However, there is increased opacification over lateral left
 lower lung, possibly parenchymal or related to tracking pleural effusion. 
 Possible trace right pleural effusion.  The heart is not well evaluated given
 the overall parenchymal opacification.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes
 are grossly unchanged.  Multiple bilateral rib deformities are not essentially
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacities projecting over the lateral lower left lung may reflect a
 tracking pleural effusion, consolidation, or, given the peripheral location,
 pulmonary infarction from pulmonary embolus.  To evaluate for effusion,
 lateral radiograph would be helpful.  To evaluate for pulmonary embolus, chest
 CTA would be recommended.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  New opacities projecting over the lateral lower left lung
 may reflect a tracking pleural effusion, consolidation, or, given the
 peripheral location, pulmonary infarction from pulmonary embolus.  To evaluate
 for effusion, lateral radiograph would be helpful.  To evaluate for pulmonary
 embolus, chest CTA would be recommended.
