                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with sarcoid, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Upright AP view the chest ___, CT chest ___
 and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Diffuse coarse interstitial opacities bilaterally with
 superior hilar retraction and upper lobe architectural distortion appear
 similar, compatible with known sarcoidosis.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours appear unchanged.  Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph
 nodes are re- demonstrated.  Bilateral hilar enlargement suggests underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  No new
 gross focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Multiple
 chronic bilateral rib deformities are re- demonstrated.  Additionally, mild
 height loss of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction is unchanged. 
 Bilateral breast implants are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No gross interval change in fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease likely
 due to sarcoidosis.  Bilateral hilar enlargement suggestive of pulmonary
 arterial hypertension.
