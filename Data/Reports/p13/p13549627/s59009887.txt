                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement appears similar compared to
 the prior study.  Linear and streaky atelectasis is noted in the lung bases
 without focal consolidation.  Small pleural effusions are similar.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Right PICC tip appears somewhat withdrawn in the
 interval, terminating within the proximal right subclavian vein.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PICC tip has been withdrawn in the interval, now terminating within
 the proximal right subclavian vein.
 2. Similar mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
