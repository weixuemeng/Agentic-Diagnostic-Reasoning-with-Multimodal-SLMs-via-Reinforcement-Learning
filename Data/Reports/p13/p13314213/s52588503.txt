                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension and PVD, status post
 ileostomy takedown, now with acute renal failure, evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Feeding tube is noted extending below the
 diaphragm with the tip not clearly visualized within the field of view
 provided.  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings.  Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  There is stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is
 right basal opacification consistent with atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacification appears consistent with atelectasis.  Small amount of pleural
 effusion at the left lung base cannot be excluded.  Left-sided pleural
 effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis appears relatively similar to
 the most recent prior examination.  Underlying infectious process cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
