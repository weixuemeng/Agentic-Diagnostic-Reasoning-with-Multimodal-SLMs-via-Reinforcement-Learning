                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of maligant pleural effusion, with
 prior drainage
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely
 within the aorta.  A moderate size right pleural effusion which appears to be
 partially loculated laterally appears similar in size compared to most recent
 prior exam.  Right basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis. Left lung is
 clear with the exception of minimal atelectasis at the base. No left-sided
 pleural effusion is noted, and no pneumothorax is identified. Calcified
 granuloma in the right upper lobe appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate size right pleural effusion which appears partially loculated
 laterally, with right basilar atelectasis.  Findings appear similar compared
 to the prior chest radiograph.
