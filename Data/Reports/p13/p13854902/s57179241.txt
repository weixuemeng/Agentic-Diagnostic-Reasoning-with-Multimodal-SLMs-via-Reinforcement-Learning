 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and hemoptysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patchy prominence of
 opacifications involving both lungs has substantially decreased.  Mild
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some residual elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  No evidence of pleural effusion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
