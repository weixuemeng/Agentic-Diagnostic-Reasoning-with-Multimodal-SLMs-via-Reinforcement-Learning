                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HCV cirrhosis and new abdominal swelling.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate mildly low
 lung volumes, accentuating the cardiac contour and pulmonary vasculature.
 Right basilar opacity is noted and likely corresponds to ateletasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild right basilar atelectasis. Follow up radiograph is
 recommended for evaluation of resolution.
