                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough x3 weeks.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Cardiac silhouette appears prominent but could
 be exaggerated by shallow inspiration.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is increased peribronchial density in the lower lobes on
 the lateral view.  On the PA view, it is not clear whether it is more
 prominent on the right than left.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax, and no evidence for pulmonary edema.  There is mild anterior
 wedging of ___ mid to lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Prominence of peribronchial markings in the lower lobes, possibly greater
 on the right than left, is compatible with atypical pneumonia, given the
 patient's history.
 2. Cardiac silhouette is abnormally prominent for age, but this could be
 secondary to shallow inspiration.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinically warranted, repeated radiographs or
 echocardiography could be obtained.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were discussed over the telephone by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ at 16:45 on ___.
