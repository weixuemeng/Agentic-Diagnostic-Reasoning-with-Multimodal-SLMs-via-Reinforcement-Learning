  An ET tube terminates approximately 5.6 cm above the carina.  New since prior
  exam is an additional left chest tube.  Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema
  is consistent with chest tube placement.  Hazy opacification of left lung
  field likely reflects posterior layering of pleural fluid on this supine
  radiograph.  There is no new parenchymal opacity.  There is no right pleural
  effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemothorax eval for ct placement  // eval
 new ct placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph from earlier the same date, a second
 chest tube has been placed in the left hemi thorax with no definite
 pneumothorax.  Worsening opacification in the left retrocardiac region is
 likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  No other relevant
 changes.
