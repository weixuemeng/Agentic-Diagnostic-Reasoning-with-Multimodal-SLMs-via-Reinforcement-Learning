                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough ,abnormal lung exam  // r/o PNA     
 r/o PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the previous study of ___, there is little overall
 change there.  Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with extensive
 interstitial thickening at the bases bilaterally.  On the lateral view, there
 is substantial interstitial changes in the middle lobe, consistent with the
 fibrosis and bronchiectasis seen on a prior CT scan in ___.
 No definite acute focal consolidation, though the development of superimposed
 pneumonia in an area of interstitial change would be impossible to exclude in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr.  ___, at her request.
