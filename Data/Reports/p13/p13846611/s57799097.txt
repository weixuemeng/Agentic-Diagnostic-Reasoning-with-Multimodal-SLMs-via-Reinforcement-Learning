 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Lungs are hyperinflated with
 lower lung streaky reticular opacities again noted, likely chronic and
 representing the sequelae of aspiration or atypical infection.  However, there
 is subtle increase in streaky opacity in the right lung base as compared with
 recent prior chest radiograph suggesting an acute pneumonic component.  Also
 noted, is a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with streaky opacities in the lower lungs slightly
 increased on the right concerning for acute on chronic infection.  Tiny right
 pleural effusion.
