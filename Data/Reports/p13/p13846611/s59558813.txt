                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chronic changes on X-ray  and b/l
 bibasilar rales  // f/u ?R sided PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interstitial thickening at the bases bilaterally, and of the right
 middle lobe seen on the lateral, which are largely unchanged in comparison to
 the prior chest radiograph.  The lungs are hyperinflated, but otherwise clear.
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged interstitial thickening of bilateral bases and right middle lobe due
 to fibrosis and bronchiectasis seen on prior chest CT.  With these changes, it
 is difficult to exclude underlying pneumonia.  No new areas of opacification.
