                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with fever  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Subtle opacity projecting over
 the right lung base is not confirmed on the lateral projection. Therefore,
 this may represent overlying breast tissue though pneumonia difficult to
 entirely exclude. Otherwise lungs are clear. No effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity overlying the right lung base on frontal view could represent
 superimposed breast tissue though difficult to exclude underlying pneumonia.
 Please correlate clinically.
