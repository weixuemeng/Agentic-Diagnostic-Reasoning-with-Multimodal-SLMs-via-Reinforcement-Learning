                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, probable MRSA pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  The patient is status post sternotomy.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is similar to the prior film.  Right paratracheal soft tissues
 are consistent with vascular ectasia in someone of this age.  There is
 borderline upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is some patchy
 opacity at left greater than right lung bases.  Findings on the left are
 similar to the prior film.   No other focal infiltrate is identified.  No
 gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Probable bibasilar atelectasis. An early infiltrate at the left base is
 considered less likely, but remains in the differential. Attention to opacity
 at the left base is recommended to confirm resolution.  
 
 2) Compared with ___, the overall appearance is similar, except for slight
 clearing of changes at the right base.
