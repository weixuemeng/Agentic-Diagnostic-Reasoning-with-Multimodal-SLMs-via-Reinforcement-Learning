                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p Cabg  // eval effusions      eval effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly better lung
 volumes. Prominence of the cardio mediastinal silhouette has decreased, much
 of which probably reflects the upright PA rather than supine AP position. 
 Opacification at the left base is again seen, consistent with pleural effusion
 and compressive atelectasis, along with Ace streak of atelectasis in the left
 mid-zone. Pulmonary vascular congestion has essentially cleared.
