                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with h/o CKD, CHF, CAD s/p CABGx3 in ___ presents
 with CHF exacerbation. Now s/p chest tube placement  // please eval for
 interval change, pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, low lying left pleural
 catheter is present, with near complete resolution of left pleural effusion
 and development of a small left apical pneumothorax. Airspace opacities in
 left lower lobe could potentially be due to localized re-expansion edema. 
 Exam is also remarkable for interstitial edema, improving aeration at the
 right lung base and a persistent small right pleural effusion.
