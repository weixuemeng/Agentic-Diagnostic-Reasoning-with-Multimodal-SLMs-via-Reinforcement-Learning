                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  : ___F with dyspnea  // CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires are demonstrated and appear intact.  The heart is
 enlarged but stable in size from ___.  There is a moderate left
 pleural effusion as well as mild bilateral opacities, suggestive of edema. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is a small right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion and moderate left pleural effusion with bilateral
 pulmonary opacities suggestive of edema.  Recommend repeat imaging after
 diuresis to evaluate for underlying infection.  Another possible etiology of
 these constellation of findings (given recent cardiac surgery) is post
 pericardiotomy syndrome.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
