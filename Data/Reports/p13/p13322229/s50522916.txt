                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is an opacity in the posterior lower medial left lower lobe silhouetting the
 hemidiaphragm and also visible as a retrocardiac opacity on the frontal view,
 most suggestive of pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  It is
 difficult to exclude the coinciding presence of a very small pleural effusion
 on the right, although a substantial one is doubted.  The posterior right
 costophrenic sulcus is sharp.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia. 
 Substantial pleural effusion is doubtful.
