                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with anterior right sternal rib pain for six
 months.  History of rib 7 through 9 fracture in the medial axillary line in
 ___.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well
 inflated.  Apparent blunting of the left costophrenic angle is associated with
 stable appearance to mediastinal fat.  No new consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax is present.  Right upper lobe scattered granulomas are stable. 
 The fractures of the posterior right fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs are old. 
 An anterior right fifth rib fracture may be new or artifactual.  No new
 displaced fractures are identified.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Several old right posterior, anterior, and lateral rib fractures.
 Potential right anterior fifth rib fracture.  A rib series with a radiopaque
 marker placed at the site of pain would be more sensitive.
