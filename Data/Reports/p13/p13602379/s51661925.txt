                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 x-ray from ___ and CTA chest from ___.  Large
 right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.  Large hiatal hernia is better
 characterized on the current exam due to air within the stomach.  Left-sided
 pleural calcification is again noted.  Superiorly, the lungs remain clear
 without focal consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to
 assess but grossly unchanged.  Multiple old bilateral rib fractures are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in large right pleural effusion
 and left calcified pleural plaques.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
