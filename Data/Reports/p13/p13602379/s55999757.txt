                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 4:49
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with Pleurx catheter placed on ___ with
 concern for pneumothorax versus trapped lung, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 15:47.
 
 A portable semi-upright chest film, ___ at 4:49  is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There continues to be a right apical lateral and likely basilar
 pneumothorax with a right pleural catheter remaining in place.  Overall, there
 is increasing opacification at the right mid and lower thorax.  If trapped
 lung remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT would be
 helpful.  There is persistent opacity at the left base, particularly
 retrocardiac, which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis in the
 setting of a layering effusion.  There is increased fullness of the perihilar
 vasculature and indistinctness of the interstitium, which suggest a
 superimposed component of pulmonary edema at the present time.  Left pleural
 calcifications are again seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable, although difficult to assess due to the airspace process.
