                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left lateral and basilar calcified pleural
 plaque is redemonstrated, which limits assessment of the underlying lung
 parenchyma.  There is a large hiatal hernia redemonstrated, and this obscures
 the size of the cardiac silhouette, which is likely mildly enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Since
 the prior study, there is a new right basilar opacity which llikely reflects a
 combination of a moderate pleural effusion and atelectasis, though infection
 or aspiration is not excluded.  Patchy opacity in left lung base may also be
 present, but again this area is not well assessed given the presence of
 overlying pleural plaques.  There is biapical pleural thickening and scarring.
 Old rib deformities are noted bilaterally.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New opacity within the right lung base which likely represents a
 combination of a moderate sized pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
 though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Calcified pleural plaque
 in the left lung base somewhat limits evaluation of the underlying lung
 parenchyma, and a left basilar process cannot be completely excluded.  Large
 hiatal hernia.
