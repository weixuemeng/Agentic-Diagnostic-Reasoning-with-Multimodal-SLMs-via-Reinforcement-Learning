 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has
 been interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, particularly on the
 right, which may be partially loculated, with overlying atelectasis. 
 Bibasilar consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given the bibasilar opacities.  Left calcified
 pleural plaques are again seen.  Old bilateral rib fractures are again noted
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, particularly on
