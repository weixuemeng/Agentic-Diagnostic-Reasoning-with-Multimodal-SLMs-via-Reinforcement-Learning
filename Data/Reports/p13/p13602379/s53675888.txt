                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with known pneumonia.  Re-evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Since prior, there has been slight
 interval increase of the large right-sided pleural effusion.  Underlying
 consolidation would be difficult to assess.  Pleural-based calcifications
 projecting over the left hemithorax are unchanged.  Superiorly the lungs are
 grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged and
 difficult to assess.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected, old left
 lateral rib fractures again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion.  No definite other
 changed noting that subtle underlying parenchymal changes would be difficult
 to assess given changes mentioned above.
