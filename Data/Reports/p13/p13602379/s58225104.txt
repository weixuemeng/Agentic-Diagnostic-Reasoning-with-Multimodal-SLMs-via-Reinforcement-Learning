                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dyspnea on exertion,
 question effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There has
 been interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis.  Left base pleural calcification and atelectasis/scarring is
 without significant interval change.  Multiple prior right-sided rib fractures
 are again seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed given the
 right-sided pleural effusion, although grossly the cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in moderate-to-large right pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis.
