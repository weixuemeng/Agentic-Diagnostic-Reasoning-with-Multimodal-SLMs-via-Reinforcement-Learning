                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased left-sided weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly tortuous. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary edema.  Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
