                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Coronary CTA of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single frontal view of the chest demonstrates slightly increased lung
 volumes.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The ascending aorta
 appears tortuous.  Aortic valve calcifications are noted.  Heart size is
 mildly enlarged.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Opacity at the cardiophrenic
 angle likely corresponds to pericardial fat pad better seen on prior CT. 
 Pacemaker leads project over right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
