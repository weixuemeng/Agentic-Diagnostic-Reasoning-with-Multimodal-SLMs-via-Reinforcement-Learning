 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pacemaker overlies the left chest wall, leads appear unchanged.  Low lung
 volumes, unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Persistent
 opacity of the lung bases likely represents atelectasis, although infection
 can't entirely be excluded.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  Surgical clips
 in the right upper quadrant may be from prior cholecystectomy.

 Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung
 volumes although infection cannot be entirely excluded. Unchanged appearance
 from prior examination.
