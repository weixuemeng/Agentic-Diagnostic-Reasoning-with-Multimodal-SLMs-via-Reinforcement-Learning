                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with nausea, vomiting, confusion, please eval for occult
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  Hilar contours are similar.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted on the lateral view.
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Marked degenerative
 changes are noted involving the right glenohumeral joint with superior
 subluxation of the right humeral head, unchanged
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, mild bibasilar
 atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
