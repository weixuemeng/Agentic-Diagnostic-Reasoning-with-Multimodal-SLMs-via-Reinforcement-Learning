                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fatigue. Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The chest radiograph is limited by suboptimal patient positioning and
 rotation. Lungs are hyperinflated with heterogeneous bibasilar opacities,
 right greater than left. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted with numerous mediastinal surgical clips and intact
 sternal wires.  Linear opacities projecting over the left lung are likely due
 to underlying scarring with suspected deformities of the anterior ribs as
 well, potentially due to remote prior trauma or surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly with heterogeneous bibasilar opacities which may represent
 atelectasis or developing infection. No pleural effusion.
