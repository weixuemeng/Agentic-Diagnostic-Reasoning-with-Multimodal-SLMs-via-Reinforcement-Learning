                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leg swelling, history of diastolic dysfunction.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is
 normal.  The aorta remains tortuous, but the mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  Lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  Degenerative changes of the
 glenohumeral joints are also noted, as well as involving the right
 acromioclavicular joint. A tiny ossific well-corticated density is noted
 superior to the right AC joint, likely the sequela of prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
