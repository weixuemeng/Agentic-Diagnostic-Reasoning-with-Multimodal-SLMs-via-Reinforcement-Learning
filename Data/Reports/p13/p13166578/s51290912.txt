                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:  A diffuse interstitial pattern has improved, with residual
 interstitial opacities predominantly at the lung bases.  There are no
 confluent areas of consolidation.  A few scattered linear areas of atelectasis
 are demonstrated in the left mid and both lower lungs suggestive of linear
 atelectasis.  Additionally, there is apparent bronchial wall thickening in the
 lower lobes.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits, with stable tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving diffuse interstitial abnormality, which may be due to
 an atypical pneumonia.  Differential diagnosis includes drug reaction and
 interstitial edema, although there are no supporting findings to suggest
 volume overload or CHF.
