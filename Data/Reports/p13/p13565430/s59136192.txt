                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fevers/atelectasis  // evaluate for
 interval change, atelectasis/pneumonia      evaluate for interval change,
 atelectasis/pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural
 effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis.  Indistinctness of engorged
 pulmonary vessels again is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
