                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxemia, pulm edema, atelctasis  // any
 improvement in lung volumes, edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette silhouette is enlarged, unchanged compared
 with ___.  Upper zone redistribution and diffuse increased
 interstitial markings are also similar. There is thickening of the minor
 fissure.  The inspiratory volumes are slightly low, with elevated diaphragms. 
 There  is opacity at both bases peripherally, suggestive of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Again seen is increased
 retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with CHF, including extensive interstitial edema and
 probable small areas of alveolar edema, as well small bilateral effusions. 
 This has worsened compared with 05:24 on ___, but is similar to the
 most recent prior chest x-ray from 11:37 ___.  Although note is made
 that PJP (PCP)  pneumonia can appear similar to CHF, the rapid course of
 development is more suggestive of CHF.
 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.
 
 Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
