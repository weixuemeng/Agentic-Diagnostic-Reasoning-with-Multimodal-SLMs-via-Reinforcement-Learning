                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Assessment is limited by markedly low lung volumes and AP
 technique.  The lungs are without focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is exaggerated due to large epicardial fat pad.  No effusions are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to extremely low lung volumes without acute
 intrathoracic process.
