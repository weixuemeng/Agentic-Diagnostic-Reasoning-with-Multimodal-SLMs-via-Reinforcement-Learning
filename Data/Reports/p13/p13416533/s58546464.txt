                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right lung base opacification followup.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is most likely
 consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension in this patient with substantial
 enlargement of the lung volumes, most likely consistent with pulmonary
 hypertension, COPD-related.  Right upper lobe focal nodular area appears to be
 a little bit more prominent than on the prior study and might potentially
 represent small pulmonary nodule.  There is no evidence of right lower lobe
 abnormality seen on the prior radiograph.  No pleural effusion is
 demonstrated.  Evaluation of the patient with chest CT is required for precise
 characterization of the right upper lobe nodular opacity to exclude the
 possibility of spiculated pulmonary nodule.
