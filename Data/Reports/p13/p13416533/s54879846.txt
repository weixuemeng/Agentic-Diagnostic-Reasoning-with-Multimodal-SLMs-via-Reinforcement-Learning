                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with complaint of productive cough and
 shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vessels
 towards the lung apices.  Lucency within the upper lung lobes bilaterally
 appears compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the
 lateral view likely represents pleural scarring.  Opacification at the right
 lung base appears more prominent on today's study compared to ___
 and may represent atelectasis versus infectious process; however, should be
 followed up to document resolution and rule out malignancy.
