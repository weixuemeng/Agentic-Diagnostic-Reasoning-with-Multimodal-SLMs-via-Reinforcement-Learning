                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina with the
 neck apparently in a flexed position.  Nasogastric tube terminates within the
 stomach.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy bibasilar opacities involving the left
 lower lobe to a greater degree than the right, most likely represents patchy
 atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting, but coexisting aspiration is
 possible.  No visible pneumothorax.
