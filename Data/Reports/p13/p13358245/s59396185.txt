                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  Aorta is tortuous and mildly
 calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 Streaky opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis or
 scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Scarring versus atelectasis in the right lung base.  Otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
