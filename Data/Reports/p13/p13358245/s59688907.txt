                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative CABG.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with retrocardiac opacification
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The pneumomediastinum is slowly clearing.  Central catheter
 remains in place.  No evidence of vascular congestion at this time.
