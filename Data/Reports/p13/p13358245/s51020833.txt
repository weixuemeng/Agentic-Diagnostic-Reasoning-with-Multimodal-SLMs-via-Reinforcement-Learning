                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Perihilar opacities correspond with
 mild pulmonary edema.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is
 similar to prior examination and likely reflects chronic pleural thickening. 
 No confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild pulmonary edema
