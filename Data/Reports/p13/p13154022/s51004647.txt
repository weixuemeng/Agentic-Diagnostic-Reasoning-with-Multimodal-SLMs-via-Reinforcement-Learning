                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable and appear not significantly changed allowing for differences
 in technique including low lung volumes.  There are patchy opacifications in
 the lingula and even more extensive within the left lower lobe, where air
 bronchograms can also be seen, most suggestive of pneumonia.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New multifocal opacities in the left lung suggesting pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs are recommended following treatment within eight weeks in
 order to show resolution.
