                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post PEA arrest, pneumonia, on antibiotics, persistent
 oxygen requirement.  Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The previously seen pulmonary
 edema has decreased.  There is a small right pleural effusion which is
 difficult to see on prior studies.  No left pleural effusion.  The right
 middle lobe pneumonia is slightly decreased.  There is no pneumothorax.  Some
 patchy opacities in the right upper lobe anteriorly are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion.  Right middle lobe and right upper
 lobe opacities likely representing pneumonia are slightly decreased compared
 to prior study however this may be due to a better inspiration.
