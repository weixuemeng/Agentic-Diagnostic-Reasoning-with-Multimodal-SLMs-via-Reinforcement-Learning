                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath and hypertension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two AP frontal views of the chest were obtained.  Increased lucency
 at the bilateral apices is likely due to emphysema.  Previously noted
 bibasilar airspace opacities have resolved. There is no consolidation,
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal, and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Mild emphysematous changes.
