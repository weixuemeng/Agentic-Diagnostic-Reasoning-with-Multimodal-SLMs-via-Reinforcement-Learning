                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD now presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest (4 exposures).  Relative
 increase in lucencies within the lung apices is consistent with known
 emphysema.  Bibasilar opacities appear similar to prior and are presumably
 vessels and atelectasis.  There is no focal airspace consolidation that is
 worrisome for pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may reflect scarring and is
 unchanged.  The heart size is normal and there is no evidence for pulmonary
 edema.  The mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
