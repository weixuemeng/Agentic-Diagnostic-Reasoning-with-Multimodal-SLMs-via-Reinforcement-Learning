                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There is, however, new left
 basilar opacities, some of which is due to likely partially loculated
 left-sided pleural effusion, both laterally and posteriorly.  Underlying
 consolidation and/or atelectasis is also seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Old posterior left ninth and lateral left eighth rib
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left base opacities, which in part likely represent loculated
 effusions, both posteriorly and laterally with underlying infection and
 possibly atelectasis.  Consider CT scan for further delineation.
