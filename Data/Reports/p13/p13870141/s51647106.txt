                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral asymmetrically distributed pulmonary opacities show
 interval improvement, particularly in the right mid and lower lung regions. 
 Such rapid change strongly favors pulmonary edema.  Residual opacities could
 reflect asymmetrical edema with or without coexisting pneumonia.  Interval
 removal of left-sided chest tube with persistent small left pleural effusion,
 but no visible pneumothorax.  Partial clearing of left retrocardiac opacity. 
 Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
