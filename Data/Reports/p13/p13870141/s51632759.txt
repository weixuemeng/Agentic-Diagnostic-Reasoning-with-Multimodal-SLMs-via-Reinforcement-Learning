                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, empyema status post decortication with a
 left-sided chest tube.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left-sided chest tubes are unchanged in position.  There may be
 a tiny left apical pneumothorax, which is expected given the presence of a
 chest tube.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are
 persistent.  Increase in opacities at the lung bases bilaterally may be
 concerning for worsening infection.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening opacities at the lung bases bilaterally is concerning for worsening
 infection.
