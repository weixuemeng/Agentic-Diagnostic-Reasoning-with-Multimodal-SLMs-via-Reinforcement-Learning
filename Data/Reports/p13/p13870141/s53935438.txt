                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of recent aspiration, treated for pneumonia, now with
 left-sided loculated pleural effusion.  Please evaluate for left-sided
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS: Radiograph from ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Single AP frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: The right lung demonstrates a small pleural effusion, slightly
 increased compared to the prior exam.  The patient is status post left-sided
 VATS and decortication with interval placement of a left-sided chest tube
 terminating at the left lung apex. A second chest tube is seen terminating at
 the left lung base. Opacity at the mid left lung may be secondary to
 atelectasis with superimposed effusion. There is a small left sided
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New small left pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Opacity in the left lung may be secondary to atelectasis; however,
 assessment of the extent of the left-sided effusions is limited.
 
 3.  Small right pleural effusion has increased compared to the prior exam.
