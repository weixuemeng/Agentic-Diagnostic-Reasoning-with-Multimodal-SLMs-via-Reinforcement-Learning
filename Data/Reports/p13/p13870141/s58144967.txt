                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left-sided chest tube with low hematocrit.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 Right-sided PICC is again seen, now terminating in the low SVC.  There are two
 left-sided chest tubes, one which terminates in the left upper hemithorax, the
 other takes a sharp turn and projects over the left lower hemithorax.  There
 is patchy left mid-to-lower lung opacity with possible slight blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle suggesting a small left pleural effusion with
 continued concern for at least partially loculated pleural effusion
 posteriorly and laterally.  Mild mid lung streaky opacities are again seen in
 the lateral view.  Aside from possible slight blunting of the posterior right
 costophrenic angle, the right lung appears grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Concern for loculated/at least partially loculated left pleural
 effusion.  Adjacent areas of atelectasis could relate to the above; however,
 sites of infection or aspiration are not excluded.
