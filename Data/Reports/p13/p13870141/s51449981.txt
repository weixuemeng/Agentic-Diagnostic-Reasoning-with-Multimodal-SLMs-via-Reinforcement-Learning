                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with altered mental status, fall from standing  // eval for
 trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been continued interval improvement in the bilateral opacities in
 the right upper and left mid to lower lung.  On the lateral, however there is
 a new opacity projecting over the heart potentially localizing to the right
 middle lobe. Effusions have also decreased in size. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits. Healed posterior left rib fractures are
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued interval improvement of the bilateral parenchymal opacities and
 essentially resolved bilateral pleural effusions.  More conspicuous opacity
 projecting over the heart on the lateral view potentially within the right
 middle lobe may be atelectasis although infection is not excluded.
