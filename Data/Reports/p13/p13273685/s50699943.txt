                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension during dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A large bore dialysis catheter terminates in
 the expected location of the mid SVC.  Linear opacities in the retrocardiac
 region better seen on the lateral projection likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  The remainder of the lungs are clear.  There is no vascular
 congestion, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis 
 2.  Dialysis catheter in the mid SVC.  No pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.
