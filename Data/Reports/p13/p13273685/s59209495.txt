                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of congestive heart failure
 presenting status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluation for endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 The endotracheal tube tip terminates 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. 
 Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities are new from prior and  likely reflect
 moderately severe pulmonary edema given the clinical history of heart failure.
 Additionally, baseline cardiomegaly has increased, findings consistent with
 decompensated heart failure.  There are possible small layering bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A linear opacity in the
 medial right lung base is unchanged from multiple priors and may reflect a
 foreign body.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube 5.5 cm above the carina in standard position.
 
 2.  New moderately severe pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Increased cardiomegaly, now moderately severe.
 
 4.  Stable foreign body (uncertain etiology) overlying the right medial lung
 base.
