                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chills and rigors.  PICC line in place.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and scout view for more recent chest CT
 performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: A PICC line appears to have been retracted somewhat and now makes a
 single loop projecting over the medial lung apex before terminating in the
 right brachiocephalic vein, probably shortly below the confluence of the right
 internal jugular and subclavian veins.  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device
 appears unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild retraction of PICC line, which now makes a loop and
 terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
