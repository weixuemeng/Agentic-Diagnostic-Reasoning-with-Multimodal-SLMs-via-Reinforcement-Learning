 1.  Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the
 right interlobar artery.  Lung volumes are diminished, and there continue to
 be patchy opacities at both bases favoring patchy atelectasis, although
 bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  There is likely
 a small left layering effusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
