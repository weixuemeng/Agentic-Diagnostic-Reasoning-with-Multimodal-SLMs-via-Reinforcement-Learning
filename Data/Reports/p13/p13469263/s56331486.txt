                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CAD, ETOH abuse now with worsening SOB,
 rhonchi.  // any pleural effusions? Consolidations?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the patient has taken a poor
 inspiration. There is suggestion of increased opacification at the right base
 medially. Although this could reflect atelectasis or even superimposed
 pneumonia, in view of the poor inspiration the possibility of near crowding of
 vessels would have to be considered.  Otherwise, essentially within normal
 limits.
