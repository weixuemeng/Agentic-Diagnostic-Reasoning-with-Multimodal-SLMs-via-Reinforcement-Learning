 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chest pain  // new admission: SOB, chest
 pain
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a nodular opacity that has
 newly occurred, overlying the posterior right fourth rib.  This opacities
 likely due to overlap of structures. However, oblique views should be obtained
 to rule out another process.
 Otherwise no relevant changes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.
