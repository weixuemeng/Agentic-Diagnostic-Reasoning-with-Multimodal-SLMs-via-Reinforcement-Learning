 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:17 PM
  As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier today, there are persistent
  bilateral interstitial markings, more confluent in the bases.  These findings
  are suggestive of a chronic interstitial disease, however in the absence of
  old prior  studies evaluation for change is limited and superimposed component
  of edema or infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 19:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sudden dyspnea, question pneumothorax,
 pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:24.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 19:10 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight interval improvement in aeration with persistent bilateral
 interstitial abnormality, predominantly involving the lung bases.  Findings
 could reflect underlying interstitial lung disease, superimposed edema or
 infection.  There is a stable 4 cm cystic area at the right lung base
 corresponding to a cyst seen on the outside CT of ___ from___
 ___.  There is persistent slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 which is of uncertain clinical significance.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given patient rotation on the current examination.  No large
 effusions are appreciated.  No pneumothorax.
