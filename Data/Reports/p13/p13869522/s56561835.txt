                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of dementia, now presenting from___ with nausea
 and vomiting, found to have acute on chronic subdural hematomas and also
 bibasilar consolidation on CT.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with OSH chest radiographs from earlier the
 same day, ___, and OSH CT abdomen/pelvis from earlier the same
 day, ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral images of the chest.  
 
 There are low lung volumes.  There are increased interstitial lung markings
 throughout the lungs but more confluent at the bases.  In conjunction with
 prior CT, these finding likely reflect a chronic interstitial process, but the
 lack of old prior studies for comparison precludeds evaluation for change and
 a superimposed component of edema or infection would be possible.  The
 posterior costophrenic angles are excluded from this exam, but there is no
 evidence of large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal is size, accentuated by low lung
 volumes  There are right lateral rib fractures involving right ribs ___, which
 more clearly demonstrate callous formation on recent CT.  A linear calcific
 density is noted in the retrosternal region on the lateral, raising the
 possibility of calcified pleural plaque.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased interstitial lung markings throughout the lungs more confluent
 at the bases, likely reflecting at least some component chronic interstitial
 process.  A superimposed component of edema or infection would be possible. 
 
 2.  Right lateral rib fractures involving ribs ___ which show some callous
 formation on recent CT indicated they are not acute.
