                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:06 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 19:10.
 
 A portable supine chest from ___ at 3:06 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be a bilateral interstitial abnormality that is likely
 not significantly changed and may reflect chronic interstitial lung disease,
 although superimposed infection and edema is difficult to exclude.  However,
 given the absence of peribronchial cuffing, this would favor that this more
 likely is a chronic finding.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No large
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning.  4 cm cystic area
 at the right lung base is again seen corresponding to a cyst seen on the
 outside CT dated ___.
