                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia and subdural
 hematoma.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The widespread parenchymal opacities appear to be progressed and might reflect
 interval worsening of pulmonary edema on the top of pneumonia especially given
 the interval increase in the vascular pedicle.  Reassessment of the patient
 after diuresis is recommended.
