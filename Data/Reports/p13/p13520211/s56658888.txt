                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with likely aspiration, respiratory distress. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs, there is a new focal consolidation in the
 right middle lobe, concerning for pneumonia, likely aspiration given the
 clinical setting.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral pleural
 effusions, and pulmonary edema are slightly increased.  No pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to underlying
 thoracic dextroscoliosis and suboptimal patient positioning.  Long tubular
 structure is noted to run across the entire field of view, presumably outside
 the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right middle lobe consolidation is concerning for pneumonia, likely
 aspiration, given clinical history.
 
 2.  Increased volume loss, pulmonary vascular congestion, and pleural
 effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema.
