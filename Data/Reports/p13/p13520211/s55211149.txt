                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, 3+ edema ___, crackles posteriorly
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Evaluation is somewhat
 limited due to suboptimal patient positioning.  However, allowing for this
 there is hilar congestion and mild interstitial pulmonary edema noted.  There
 are probable small pleural effusions.  No large pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess due to the underlying
 scoliosis and suboptimal positioning though overall appearance appears stable.
 No acute bony injury.  Dextroscoliosis of the T-spine again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
