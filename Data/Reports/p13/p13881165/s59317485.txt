                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF, recently weight gain, and edema.  Evaluate for
 signs of CHF exacerbation on chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mild enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette, stable compared to the prior studies.  Mediastinal
 contour is otherwise unremarkable.  Pacemaker projects over the left anterior
 chest and calcifications are again seen within the aortic arch.  Lungs are
 well expanded.  Linear streaky opacity in the left lower lung is likely due to
 atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions and no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear streaky opacity in the left lower lung is likely due to
 atelectasis.  No definite evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
