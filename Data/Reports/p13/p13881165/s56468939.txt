                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, here to evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased from the most
 recent prior study.  A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with a single lead
 terminating in the right ventricle.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the diaphragm and out of view with the tip terminating in the left upper
 quadrant likely within the gastric fundus.  Mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is unchanged from the most recent prior study.  No significant
 pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected on this
 single frontal view.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are prominent on the right, which is increased from the
 most recent prior study, but likely due in part to patient rotation and lower
 lung volumes.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
 
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
