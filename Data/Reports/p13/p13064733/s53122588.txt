 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough ___  // eval for pna

 COMPARISON:  ___, CTA ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular
 predominance, similar to prior examination.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are largely unchanged, though there is a more prominent opacity in
 the right infrahilar region.  There is streaky atelectasis in both lung bases.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild multilevel degenerative
 changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite consolidation identified, though right middle lobe pneumonia is
 not entirely excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
