                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pre-op for appendectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  No prior chest x-ray for
 comparison.  There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as seen on same day
 abdominal CT. Linear opacity at the left lung base is likely due to
 atelectasis versus scarring.  There is no pleural effusion.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Hilar contours are enlarged, likely due to pulmonary arterial
 enlargement.  Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Enlarged hilar contours which are thought
 to be due to pulmonary artery enlargement, but this can be confirmed by CT.
