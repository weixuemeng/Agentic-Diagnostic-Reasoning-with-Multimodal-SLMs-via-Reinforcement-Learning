                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, history of CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which appears moderately enlarged.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again
 noted.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases which may reflect
 areas of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting low lung
 volumes.  No evidence for congestive heart failure.
