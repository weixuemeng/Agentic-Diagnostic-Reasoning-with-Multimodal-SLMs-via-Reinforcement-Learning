                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with decreased oxygen saturations status
 post surgery, evaluate for widened mediastinum.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 5:17.
 
 A portable AP view ___ at 9:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter and dual-lead left-sided pacer remain
 in place.  A left chest tube is also unchanged in position.  Lung volumes
 remain low.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post
 median sternotomy.  Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with prior
 cholecystectomy.  Streaky linear opacities particularly at the left base
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
