                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Wound
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer  // assess pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a small right pleural effusion tracking superiorly into the minor
 fissure, essentially unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  The
 known right infrahilar lung mass is partially obscured by adjacent
 atelectasis.  Interstitial opacities within the aerated portion of the right
 lower lung could potentially represent lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Severe
 emphysematous changes including right greater than left apical bullae are
 noted.  Heart size is top-normal.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probably unchanged small right pleural effusion.
