                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 3 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AVR, MVR, TVrepair, CABG  // eval for
 dobhoff tube placement R nare   Contact name: ___ , ___: ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:   3 successive AP views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:47, ___ at
 10:57
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Radiopaque tip compatible with a Dobbhoff tube is present on all three views,
 similar in appearance on all three views.  The tube courses across the lower
 portion of the right lung toward the mid right lung base and overlies the
 right mainstem bronchus.  This appearance is highly suggestive of a tube
 extending through the trachea into the lower right sided airway.
 
 Again seen is a separate, second, orogastric type tube with radiopaque tip,
 that is unchanged compared with the film obtained on ___.  The
 radiopaque tip of this second, pre-existing orogastric tube overlies expected
 position of the distal stomach, unchanged compared with ___ and
 ___.
 
 Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the lower right atrium, new similar to
 a film obtained approximately ___ min earlier the same day and should be
 retracted.  Given what appears to be quite kyphotic positioning, attempt to
 retract the PICC line by 2.5 cm could represent a conservative starting point.
 
 Left IJ central line tip also overlies the lower right atrium.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent,, but unchanged compared with earlier the same day.  Prosthetic
 valve again noted.
 
 There is diffuse vascular plethora compatible with CHF, more pronounced than
 earlier the same day.  There is increased retrocardiac density and a small to
 moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  This
 has progressed considerably compared with earlier the same day.  There is
 ill-definition of right hemidiaphragm, also new compared with the prior study
 which may represent a combination of a small amount of atelectasis and pleural
 fluid.
 
 Note is made of a curvilinear tubular density measuring approximately 18 mm
 overlying the mid abdomen this
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 One Dobbhoff tube tip overlies the overlies the right lateral lower lung and
 likely courses through the trachea and right mainstem bronchus. This should be
 addressed as soon as possible.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Enlarged and ill-defined cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 Small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation
 in the left lower lobe, is markedly progressed compared with earlier the same
 day.  Hazy increased opacity at the right lung base is new compared with
 earlier the same day, question small effusion and underlying atelectasis.
 
 Taken together, compared with less than 1 hr earlier, the findings are
 suggestive of worsening of CHF, with new or significantly increased left
 greater right pleural effusions and underlying bibasilar collapse and/or
 consolidation, particularly on the left.
 
 Right subclavian PICC line and left IJ central line both overlie the lower
 right atrium.  Consider retraction by approximately 2.5 cm.  Exact
 measurements are difficult to provide given prominent kyphotic angulation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 3:56 PM, 10 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.  The team was aware of the undesired positioning of
 the new right sided tube at the time they were attempting to place it and both
 the new and pre-existing (clogged) tubes have already been removed.  There
 also aware of the CHF findings.
