                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M PMHx CAD s/p CABG in ___, ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF
 ___% (followed by Dr. ___), critical AS (0.6cm2), complete heart block
 with permanent pacemaker (followed by Dr. ___), Afib s/p cardioversion
 (no longer anticoagulated), CKD (baseline Cr 3.0-3.2) transferred from ___ after initially presenting on ___ with weakness with UTI,
 transferred for acute decompensated CHF now with worsening AMS and WBC ct
 elevation.  // Assess for acute process, infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image there is increasing severity of the
 pulmonary edema, that now has a clear interstitial component.  The moderate
 cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis is
 unchanged.  A coexisting infectious process in the atelectatic lung portion
 cannot be excluded.  Unchanged position of the pacemaker leads.
