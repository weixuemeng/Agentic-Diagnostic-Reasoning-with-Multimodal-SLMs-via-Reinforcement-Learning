                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF, cough, altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  Triple-lead left-sided pacer device is
 again seen with leads in similar position as compared to the prior study.  The
 cardiac silhouette is moderate to severely enlarged, which could be due to
 underlying pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.  There is persistent left
 base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. 
 Trace right pleural effusion is also seen.  There is mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema suggesting fluid overload.  The aortic knob remains calcified.
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be
 due to cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.  Left base opacity, likely
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation
 difficult to exclude.  Trace right pleural effusion.  Vascular
 congestion/edema.
