                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever and productive cough x2 weeks.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild vascular congestion is present.  Localized right infrahilar
 consolidation.  Chain sutures are seen within left upper lobe consistent with
 prior partial left lung resection.
 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild vascular congestion.
 
 2.  Localized right infrahilar consolidation may reflect an early or resolving
 pneumonia.  Followup radiographs in 4 weeks are recommended to document
 resolution after appropriate therapy.
