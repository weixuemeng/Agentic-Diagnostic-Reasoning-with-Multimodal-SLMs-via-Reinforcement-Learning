                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o pneumonia. f/u CXR in ___ did not
 show resolution.  // f/u pneumonia ___      COUGH;F/U PNA ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___. 
 Between those 2 studies a dense area of consolidation at one of the lung bases
 improved, but there was still abnormality consisting of peribronchial
 infiltration seen best on the lateral view slightly posterior to the regional
 finding.  I suspect this is due to re-expansion of atelectasis due to
 bronchiectasis.  And of bronchiectasis persists.  Better documentation would
 require CT scanning.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Between ___ and ___
