                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery, to assess for widened mediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  No
 evidence of increasing widening of the mediastinum.  Huge enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette persists without appreciable vascular congestion, again
 suggesting underlying cardiomyopathy.
