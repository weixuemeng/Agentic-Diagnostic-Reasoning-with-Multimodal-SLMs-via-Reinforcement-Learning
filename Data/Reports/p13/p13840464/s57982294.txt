                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post TV (tricuspid valve?)
 repair. Post-operative.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  The patient is now intubated, the ETT seen to terminate in
 the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina.  A right internal jugular vein
 sheath is noted to reach with its tip 1 cm below the lower edge of the
 clavicle.  This is close to the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins. 
 New row of midline sternal wires indicates recent cardiac surgery.  Multiple
 external wires are overlying the chest.  There is a semi-circular metallic
 structure in the expected area of the tricuspid valve and probably relates to
 an annuloplasty.  Heart size remains enlarged with considerable prominence of
 the right atrial contour to the right.  Pulmonary vasculature is slightly
 increased, but there is no evidence of large pleural effusions and no
 pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory first post-operative chest findings.
