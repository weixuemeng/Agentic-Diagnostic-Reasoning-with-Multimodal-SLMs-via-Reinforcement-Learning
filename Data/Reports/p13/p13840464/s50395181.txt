                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Back surgery with dropping hematocrit.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is a decrease in the
 hazy opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion.  This
 may merely reflect a more upright position of the patient, though some
 decrease in effusion could have occurred.  Mild elevation of pulmonary
 vascularity, though the discordancy with the substantial enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette suggests underlying cardiomyopathy.
 
 Endotracheal tube has been removed.
