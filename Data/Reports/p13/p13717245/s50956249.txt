                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with low-grade fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac silhouette is top normal, and
 the aorta is very tortuous and may be generally large, though not focally
 aneurysmal. Tortuous vessels at the thoracic inlet lend greater radiodensity
 to the tissues projecting through the right first rib and clavicle medially. 
 The lungs are clear and there is no pleural abnormality.
