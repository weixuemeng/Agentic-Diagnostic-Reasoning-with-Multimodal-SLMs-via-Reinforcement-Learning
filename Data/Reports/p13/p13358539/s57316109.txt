                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post left thoracotomy and left upper
 lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate
 post-operative changes related to left upper lobe resection, which are similar
 in appearance to the prior study.  Slight interval improvement in the
 previously described linear opacity at the right lung base, likely
 atelectasis.  Small left-sided pleural effusion versus pleural thickening,
 unchanged from the prior study.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or consolidation.  A tube projects over
 the left upper quadrant and lower left hemithorax, which is likely external to
 the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in linear atelectasis at the right lung base.
 2.  Stable left-sided pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
