                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes related to left upper lobe resection are
 similar.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Worsening opacity at the
 right lung base is predominantly linearly oriented and accompanied by volume
 loss.  However, more subtle areas of opacity in the left mid and lower lung
 are unaccompanied by volume loss and could potentially represent a developing
 infection.  Left-sided pleural thickening and/or effusion is unchanged.  There
 is no visible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left mid and lower lung opacities, which could potentially represent a
 developing pneumonia given the clinical suspicion for infection.
 2.  Right lower lobe opacities favor atelectasis given their predominantly
 linear orientation and accompanying volume loss.
 3.  Small right pleural effusion and moderate left loculated pleural fluid
 and/or thickening.
