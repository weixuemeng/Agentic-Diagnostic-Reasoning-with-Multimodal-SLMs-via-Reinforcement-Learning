                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ at ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are low, resulting in
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures and streaky subsegmental
 atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  The mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  The heart size is normal.  The glenohumeral joints appear
 unchnaged with abnormal morphology of the humeral heads and with apparent
 dislocation.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Low lung volumes without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Chronic bilateral glenohumeral dislocation.
