 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:14 AM
  Low lung volumes with bilateral linear opacities, likely atelectasis.
  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm the tip is probably in the gastric
  fundus.  The left central venous catheter is in unchanged position.  The
  trachea appears slightly more lucent and deviated to the right on today's
  examination, likely positional in nature.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT 23:46
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Check Dobbhoff tube placement, rule out acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 16:14.
 
 Portable AP semi-upright chest film ___ at 23:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  Left internal jugular central line continues to terminate
 in the proximal SVC.  Lung volumes remain low with streaky bilateral opacities
 likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax.  No large effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
