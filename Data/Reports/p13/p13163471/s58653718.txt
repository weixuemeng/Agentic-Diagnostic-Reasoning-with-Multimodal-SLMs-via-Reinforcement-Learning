                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with gram-negative rod bacteremia and hypotension. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___

 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen is prominent right hilum,
 which is unchanged, and likely represents atelectasis versus pneumonia.  A
 left-sided IJ central venous line is seen with the tip terminating in the mid
 SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominent right hilum, unchanged, likely represents atelectasis
 versus pneumonia.
