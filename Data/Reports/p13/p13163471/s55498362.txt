 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of feeding tube with the tip projecting over the
 stomach.  Left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its
 tip in the mid-to-distal SVC.  Lung volumes remain low and there continue to
 be streaky linear opacities in both lungs, likely reflecting subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
