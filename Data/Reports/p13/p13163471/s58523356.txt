                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post NG tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 A portable AP view of the chest including the upper abdomen was obtained on
 ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction.  The left subclavian central line has been removed.  The
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is indistinctness and
 fullness to the pulmonary vascularity which likely represents interval
 development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema.  The heart
 stably enlarged.  There are likely layering bilateral effusions.  No large
 pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is
 diminished given supine technique.
