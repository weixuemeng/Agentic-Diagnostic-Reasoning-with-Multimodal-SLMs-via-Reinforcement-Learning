                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  The patient is again very rotated. 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectases, are unchanged.  Mild vascular
 congestion has improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left central catheter tip
 is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. 
 Cardiomegaly cannot be further assessed due to rotation and low lung volumes. 
 Widened mediastinum due to the projection is unchanged.
