                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tiny left basilar pneumothorax identified
 during CT-guided biopsy morning of ___  ___/ eval for PTX     eval for PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is a small postprocedure
 pneumothorax.  The area of increased opacification in the right mid zone has
 slightly decreased, whereas the opacification at the left base appears more
 prominent than on the earlier study, both of which probably represent
 multifocal pneumonia.  Nodular opacifications were much better seen on the CT
 scan of ___.
