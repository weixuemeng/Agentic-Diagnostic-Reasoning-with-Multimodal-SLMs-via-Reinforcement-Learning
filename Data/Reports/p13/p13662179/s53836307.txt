                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with DOE  // Pulmonary edema or pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral opacities better
 appreciated on recent dedicated chest CT dated ___ consistent
 with lung nodules.  The largest opacity within the left lower lobe is best
 demonstrated on the lateral radiograph which measures approximately 2 cm in
 diameter.  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and result in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures, particularly at the bases. 
 Attenuation of upper lobe vessels corresponds to emphysema on recent CT. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysematous changes with bilateral nodules, better evaluated on CT dated ___.  No convincing evidence of pulmonary edema or consolidation
 worrisome for infectious process.
