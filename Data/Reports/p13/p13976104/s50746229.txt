                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval for effusion      eval for
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the right IJ catheter is been
 removed.  The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen and the hazy opacification
 at the bases is no longer present.  Although this may reflect some improvement
 in pleural effusions and atelectatic changes, much of the difference in
 appearance may be a manifestation of the erect position of the patient.  Mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is seen with atelectatic changes at the
 base.
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
