                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent seizure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Density of the left hemithorax appears diffusely increased compared to the
 right, but this appearance is suspected to represent an artifact associated
 with soft tissue attenuation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lung volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite evidence of acute disease.  Veil-like increased
 opacity over the left hemithorax, probably an artifact.  However, short-term
 radiographs could be considered to follow up, particularly if pulmonary
 symptoms are present or for other concern.
