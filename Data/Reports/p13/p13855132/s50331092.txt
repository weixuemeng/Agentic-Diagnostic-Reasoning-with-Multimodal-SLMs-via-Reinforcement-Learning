  1. Unchanged moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild associated
  interstitial edema.
  2. Ill-defined right lower lung airspace opacities may represent asymmetric
  edema, atelectasis, or focal consolidation.
  3. No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with replaced trach, resp distress, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal semi-upright view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is been advanced compared with the prior study, now
 terminating 5.1 cm from the carina.  Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion
 with mild associated interstitial pulmonary edema is similar to the prior
 study.  Right lower lung airspace opacities may represent asymmetric edema,
 atelectasis, or consolidation, depending upon the clinical setting.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Calcification of the aortic arch is
 noted.  Apparent moderate to severe degenerative changes of the right shoulder
 are partially evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild associated
 interstitial edema.
 2. Ill-defined right lower lung airspace opacities may represent asymmetric
 edema, atelectasis, or focal consolidation.
 3. No pneumothorax.
