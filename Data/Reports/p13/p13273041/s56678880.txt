 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs with
 some cephalization of pulmonary vasculature and haziness about the hilum,

 cardiomegaly.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The aorta is
 somewhat tortuous.  There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
