                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again demonstrated is a large left pleural effusion which is loculated
 laterally, slightly decreased in size when compared to the prior study.  Small
 right pleural effusion appears slightly increased compared to the prior exam. 
 There is continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Left basilar
 lung opacification likely reflects atelectasis, similar when compared to the
 prior study.  No areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated in the right
 lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Loculated large left pleural effusion, perhaps minimally decreased in size
 compared to the prior study, and small right pleural effusion, slightly
 increased compared to the prior exam.  Persistent left basilar atelectasis.
