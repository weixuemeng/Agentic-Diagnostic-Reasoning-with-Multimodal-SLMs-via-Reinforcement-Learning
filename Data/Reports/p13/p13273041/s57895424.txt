                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with recurrent left pleural effusion and concern
 for pneumonia, here to evaluate for underlying consolidation with lateral
 decubitus view.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A large left pleural effusion is again seen obscuring the lung from
 the level of the third intercostal space to the diaphragm, some of which is
 free pleural fluid seen shifting into the left apex on the lateral decubitus
 view.  However, the pleural effusion has an unusual configuration with
 preservation of the left heart border which raises the possibility of a
 partially loculated effusion. 
 
 The left lung apex is well aerated.  The right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. 
 Degenerative changes are again noted in the thoracic spine.  Underlying left
 lower lobe consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large left pleural effusion is partially free pleural fluid, but
 may be partially loculated.  If clinical concern persists, a followup CT could
 be considered for further evaluation.
