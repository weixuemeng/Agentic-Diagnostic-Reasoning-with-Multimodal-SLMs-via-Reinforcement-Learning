                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough for three weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing relatively
 extensive left pleural effusion has completely resolved.  At the level of the
 left and right costophrenic sinus, minimal pleural scarring is still seen,
 slightly more extensive on the left than on the right.  The lateral radiograph
 additionally reveals flattening of the hemidiaphragms, indicative of moderate
 overinflation.  The lung parenchyma appears normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema and no focal area of increased radiodensity, potentially suggestive of
 pneumonia.  No lung nodules or masses.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette with minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.
