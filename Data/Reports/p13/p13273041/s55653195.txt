                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and end-stage renal disease.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased
 opacification of the bilateral bases extending to the mid lungs, consistent
 with pulmonary edema, but underlying infection cannot be excluded.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions which have increased slightly in size as
 compared to the prior study. There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with pulmonary edema, but underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend followup radiographs post-diuresis to evaluate
 for underlying infection.
