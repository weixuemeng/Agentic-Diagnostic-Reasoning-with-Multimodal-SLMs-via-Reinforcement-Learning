                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of rheumatoid arthritis and
 new onset of shortness of breath overnight.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding AP
 and lateral chest examination ___ ___.  The bilateral basal densities
 have increased markedly since the preceding study and indicate reoccurrence of
 advanced CHF.  Pleural effusion are more marked on the left side than the
 right.  Also difficult to identify on the somewhat underexposed single view
 examination, there appears to be marked perivascular haze in the pulmonary
 circulation suggesting beginning pulmonary edema.  Followup examination after
 treatment is recommended.
