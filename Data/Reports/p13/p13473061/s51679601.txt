                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Recent coronary bypass graft surgery, presenting with angina
 equivalent.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 central venous catheter has been removed.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Pleural effusions have resolved.  Basilar opacities have also almost fully
 resolved, although there is still patchy density projecting over the lingula
 and perhaps the left lower lobe.  This could be seen as a residual atelectasis
 or scarring, although an infectious etiology is difficult to completely
 exclude in the appropriate setting.  Mild degenerative changes are present
 along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.  
 
 2.  Patchy basilar opacities, which are probably compatible with residual
 improved atelectasis, which was more extensive on the prior examination,
 although an infectious etiology cannot be completely excluded by this study.
