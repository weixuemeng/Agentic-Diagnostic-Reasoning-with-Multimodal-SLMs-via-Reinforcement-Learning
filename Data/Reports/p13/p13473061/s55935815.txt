                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with shortness of breath and cough,
 basilar crackles, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  There is status post
 sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips mostly in the anterior
 left side mediastinum indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart size
 is at the upper limit of normal variation with a relative prominence of a left
 ventricular contour.  Thoracic aorta is of ordinary dimension but moderately
 elongated.  No local contour abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute parenchymal infiltrates are
 present.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  When comparison
 is made with the next preceding examinations of ___, the
 patient had post-operatively some peripheral pleural scar formations and
 peripheral plate atelectasis at the bases.  All these changes have now
 normalized and there is no evidence of any acute parenchymal infiltrates.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No pneumothorax is seen in the apical
 area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post bypass surgery.  No evidence of remaining pulmonary
 congestion or acute pneumonic infiltrates in this patient with shortness of
 breath and cough.
