                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 6:18.  Multiple chest
 radiographs dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is rotated, somewhat limiting the exam.  The opacity at
 the right base is less obvious than in the prior radiograph, although likely
 unchanged.  No new opacities are identified.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 The stomach is air-filled and distended.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably stable right lower lobe opacity.  Otherwise, no
 significant change from the prior radiograph.
