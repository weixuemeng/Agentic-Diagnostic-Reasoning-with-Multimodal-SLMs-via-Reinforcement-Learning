                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall from standing with pelvic / L hip pain
 // evaluate traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Patchy opacities at the bases bilaterally likely
 reflect atelectasis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot entirely be
 excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  Small left pleural effusion.  No
 pulmonary edema.  There is moderate cardiomegaly with calcifications of the
 aortic knob.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with patchy opacities at the bases bilaterally,
 likely representing atelectasis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.
