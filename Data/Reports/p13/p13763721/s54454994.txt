  Limited evaluation.  Lung volumes are decreased accentuating the cardiac

  definite focal consolidation.  If possible, recommend PA and lateral chest
  radiographs for complete evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with dyspnea and three-vessel disease, on
 catheterization, preop CABG.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can detect
 subtle interval changes.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The image was acquired with a lordotic technique.  Given this limitation, 
 however, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal
 limits.  Lung volumes are low, but no focal airspace consolidation, large
 effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
