                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hilar adenopathy seen in the prior film, to
 assess interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Previously
 noted hilar fullness in the radiograph of ___ is no longer visualized.

 left pleural effusion with compressive left basilar atelectasis has slightly
 worsened since the prior study.  There is improved pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
