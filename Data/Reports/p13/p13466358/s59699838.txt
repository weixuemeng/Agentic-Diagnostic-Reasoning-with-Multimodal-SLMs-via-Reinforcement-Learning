                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible pneumonia, limited on initial AP for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ from 5 hours prior.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is asymmetric prominence of the interstitial markings,
 especially in the lower lung zones which although may be due to pulmonary
 edema, this finding may also be due to infection or another interstitial
 process.  Additionally, there are opacities projecting over the lower portion
 of the spine on the lateral view and thus a mass at the lower pole of either
 hilum cannot be excluded. There is mild cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Asymmetric interstitial abnormality which may be due to pulmonary edema,
 possibly infection or other interstitial process. 
 2. Recommend close follow up to exclude a mass at the lower pole of either
 hilum.
