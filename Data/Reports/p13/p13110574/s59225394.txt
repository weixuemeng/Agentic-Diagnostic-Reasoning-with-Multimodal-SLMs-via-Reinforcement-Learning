                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Top-normal size of the heart is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar.  Previous pattern of interstitial pulmonary edema has slightly
 improved from the previous study.  Aeration within the right lung base has
 also improved, potentially reflective of improving atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are re- demonstrated, decreased in size on the
 right and similar in size on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.  Compression
 deformities of several upper lumbar vertebral bodies are unchanged from CT
 from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved as well as aeration within the
 right lower lobe likely reflective of atelectasis.  Decreased size of small
 right pleural effusion and relatively unchanged small left pleural effusion.
