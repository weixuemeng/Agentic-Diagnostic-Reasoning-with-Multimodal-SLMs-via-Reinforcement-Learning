                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, evaluate for evidence of CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP chest radiograph on ___. PA and lateral chest
 x-ray on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were compared with AP radiograph
 on ___.  Again seen in cardiomegaly with interstitial edema worsened
 compared to ___.  Lateral views demonstrate that a left lung base opacity
 most likely represents a small pleural effusion with associated atelectasis,
 though infection cannot be excluded. Mild patchy opacity is also noted in the
 right lung base, with a small right pleural effusion. Known left apical
 ill-defined opacity is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis, though infection is not
 excluded.
 2.  Mild interstitial edema, new from ___, with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 3.  Unchanged left apical ill-defined opacity.
