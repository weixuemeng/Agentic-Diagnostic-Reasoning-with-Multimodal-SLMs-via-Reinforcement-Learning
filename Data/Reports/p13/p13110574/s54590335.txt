                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R pleural effusion status post tunneled
 pleural catheter placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph, the moderate right pleural effusion has
 decreased, now small in size.  The new pleural catheter tip crosses the
 midline, likely positioned against the mediastinal wall.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
 
 Minimal left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists,
 with persistent vascular engorgement and slightly worsened edema.  The
 tortuous, calcified thoracic aorta and mitral annular calcifications are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right pleural catheter with a decreased, but
 persistent small right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Slightly worsened pulmonary edema.
