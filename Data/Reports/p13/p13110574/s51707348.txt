                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CHF with increasing shortness of breath and chest
 pain.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild interstitial
 edema bilaterally, new from ___.  The left internal jugular catheter has
 been removed.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, unchanged.
 There are patchy opacities in the lung bases with probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  The ;eft apical ill-defined nodular opacity is similar
 compared to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  New mild interstitial pulmonary edema compared to ___ with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 2. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
 3.  Unchanged left apical ill-defined nodular opacity.
