  1.  Mild pulmonary edema.
  
  2.  Bilateral pleural effusion.
  
  3.  Confluent right base opacity may represent pneumonia or asymmetric edema. 
  Recommend follow-up radiographs after diuresis to evaluate for resolution of
  any edema and to assess for any underlying etiology.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp and sob, HD opt. pls eval pna vs edema  //
 History: ___F with cp and sob, HD opt. pls eval pna vs edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial opacities are seen with indistinct pulmonary
 vasculature, consistent mild pulmonary edema.  Confluent right base opacity
 may represent pneumonia or asymmetric edema. There are moderate right and
 small left pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral interstitial opacities may reflect recurrent interstitial edema.  A
 more confluent
 right basilar opacity may represent pneumonia or asymmetric edema.  Recommend
 follow-up radiographs after diuresis to evaluate for resolution.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings from original wet read were communicated to
 Dr. ___ at 3:27 p.m. on ___ by phone.
