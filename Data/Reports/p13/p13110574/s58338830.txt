                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with hypoxia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right basilar opacity is in part due to pleural effusion which may be
 partially loculated and appears larger when compared to prior.  Pleural-based
 catheter is in unchanged position compared to prior.  There may also be a
 small left pleural effusion given blunting of left costophrenic angle.  Left
 upper lung opacity has not significantly changed since priors. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Dense atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted.  Left upper extremity vascular stent is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity likely in part due to right-sided pleural effusion which
 appears partially loculated and slightly larger compared to prior.  Likely
 some component of at adjacent atelectasis.  Infection cannot be excluded.
