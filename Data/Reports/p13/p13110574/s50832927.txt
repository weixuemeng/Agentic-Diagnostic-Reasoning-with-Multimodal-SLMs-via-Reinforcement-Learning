                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and history of CHF. 
 Rule out acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  There is pulmonary
 edema with increased interstitial markings bilaterally.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angels is compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Atelectasis is seen at the right lung base, where there is asymmetric
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No radiopaque
 foreign body.  Wedge deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is similar
 to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
