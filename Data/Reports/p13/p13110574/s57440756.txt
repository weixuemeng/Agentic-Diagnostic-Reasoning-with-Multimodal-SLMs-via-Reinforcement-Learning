 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  A right pleural effusion is moderate in size, increased
 from the prior exam.  A left pleural effusion is small.  There is probably
 adjacent compressive atelectasis that is worse on the right.  The degree of
 atelectasis at the right base has increased since the prior exam.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion is mild.  No overt edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified throughout. No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, slightly
 increased from the prior exam.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion, unchanged.
