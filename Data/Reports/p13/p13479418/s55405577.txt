                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with lung cancer status post chemotherapy and
 radiation therapy, with recent pneumonia versus radiation pneumonitis.  The
 patient is now increasingly short of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including ___ and ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is increasing volume loss in the right hemithorax, with progressive
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Right paramediastinal upper lobe
 opacities are more consolidative, and also decreased in a geographic stent,
 suggesting progression of radiation fibrosis.  Remainder of the lungs
 including the left hemithorax remain well aerated.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased geographic extent and increased density of right upper
 lobe paramediastinal opacities with associated increased volume loss on the
 right, suggesting progression of radiation fibrosis.
