 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing pneumonia
 at the right lung base has almost completely resolved.  Only minimal opacities
 at the right lung bases persist.  No new parenchymal opacities.  The small
 atelectasis at the left lung base is unchanged.  Unchanged are the right AP
 hilar consolidations (area of lung cancer).  Unchanged cardiac silhouette.
