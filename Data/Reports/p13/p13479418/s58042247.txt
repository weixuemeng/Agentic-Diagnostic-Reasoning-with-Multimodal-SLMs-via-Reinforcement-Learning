                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Post-lung cancer, COP.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacity at
 the right lung base has minimally increased in density but decreased in
 extent.  This suggests the presence of a retractile component or a fibrotic
 organization.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged staple lines after
 surgery and unchanged right paramediastinal post-surgical changes.  Unchanged
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged minimal left basal atelectasis.
