                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hemoptysis.  Patient on Coumadin.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Bilateral nipple shadows are visualized.
 There is again a very large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level projecting
 primarily to the right of midline.  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear. 
 Mild loss in vertebral body height among mid to lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies is probably unchanged and chronic, associated with demineralization. 
 Several mid to lower thoracic vertebral bodies have mildly biconcave endplate
 configuration that is typical for compression deformities associated with
 demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Large hiatal hernia.
