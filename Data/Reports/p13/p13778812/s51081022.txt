                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Large hiatal
 hernia is re-demonstrated with interval increase in surrounding right basilar
 opacity which is likely due to effusion and atelectasis, though developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded entirely.  The remainder of the lungs are clear. 
 There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in
 size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours aside from slightly prominent
 ascending aortic contour likely due to tortuosity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Apparent increase in right basilar opacity is likely due to pleural fluid
 and atelectasis, but infectious process or aspiration cannot be entirely
 excluded.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia
