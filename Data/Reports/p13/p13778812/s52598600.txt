 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fall and chest wall pain.  Question fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large hiatal hernia, grossly unchanged in size from the
 prior exam.  No focal opacities concerning for an infectious process are

 degenerative changes makes it difficult to evaluate for rib fractures, though
 there are no obvious rib fractures identified.  Heart size is top normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild loss of height of several
 mid and lower thoracic vertebral bodies is unchanged. No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No obvious rib fracture; if clinical concern is high, a dedicated
 rib series can be obtained.  Large hiatal hernia.  Mild right atelectasis.
