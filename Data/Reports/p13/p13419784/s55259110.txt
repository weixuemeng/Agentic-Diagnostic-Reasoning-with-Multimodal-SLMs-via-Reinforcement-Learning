                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged with a globular water bottle-like
 appearance that may reflect either pericardial effusion, marked cardiomegaly,
 or both.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. 
 There is a perhaps mild upper zone re-distribution of pulmonary vascularity
 but no clear edema.  No focal opacification is identified.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly.  In addition to enlargement of the heart,
 the possibility of a pericardial effusion should be considered.
