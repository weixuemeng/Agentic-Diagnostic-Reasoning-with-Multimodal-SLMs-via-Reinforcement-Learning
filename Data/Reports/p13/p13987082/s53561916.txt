                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar
 with enlargement of the right hilum compatible with granulomatous adenopathy. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe
 is compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. Punctate calcified granulomas in
 the left lung base are unchanged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. Rounded opacity within the medial aspect of the right
 lung base reflects a prominent right inferior pulmonary vein viewed on end.
 Moderate to severe multilevel degenerative changes are again noted in the
 thoracic spine. Multiple clips are again noted in the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
