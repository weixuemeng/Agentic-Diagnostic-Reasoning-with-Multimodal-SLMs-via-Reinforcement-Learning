 basilar hydropneumothorax has slightly decreased since the prior exam.  Right
 chest wall subcutaneous gas is likely related to pleural tube placement. 
 Right lower lobe opacities are unchanged.  The left lung is clear.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  Sternotomy wires are intact.  Numerous
 mediastinal clips are unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval placement of right apical and right base pleural drains with slight
 decrease in right hydropneumothorax.  Right chest wall subcutaneous gas is
 likely related to pleural tube placement.
