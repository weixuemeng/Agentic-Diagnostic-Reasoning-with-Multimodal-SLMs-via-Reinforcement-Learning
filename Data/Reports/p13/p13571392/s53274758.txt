                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 minimal interstitial edema.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 The aorta is calcified.  In the inferior aspect of the lateral view, there
 appears to be cement within the vertebral body, not fully imaged, but presumed
 due to prior vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty.  The bones are osteopenic diffusely.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal interstitial edema.
