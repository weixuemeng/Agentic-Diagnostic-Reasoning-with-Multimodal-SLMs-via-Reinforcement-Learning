                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trauma and rib fractures, eval interval
 change (approx 2 weeks out)  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___ and targeted review of
 chest CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with unfolding of the aorta
 again noted.  The lungs are relatively well expanded.  There is some focal
 opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  Opacity in the right cardiophrenic  region may be
 accounted for by opacities seen abutting the lower chest wall posteriorly.  No
 associated air bronchograms.  Mild deformity of the right chest wall is
 compatible with known fractures.  No CHF, other focal opacity or left-sided
 effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax detected.  The extensive subcutaneous
 is emphysema seen on the ___ radiographs has resolved.  Again seen is the
 fracture of the distal right clavicle, with displacement.  Incidental note
 made of gallstones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Focal opacity in right cardiophrenic region and blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, which may correspond to the opacity seen against the lower
 posterior chest wall.  This is not fully characterized, but could represent
 residua from the effusion and consolidation that was seen at the right lung
 base posteriorly on the ___ CT scan.  In the absence of new or
 worsening symptoms, which would argue for more full or evaluation at this
 time, followup chest x-ray in approximately 4 weeks could help to assess for
 continuing resolution.
 2. Lungs otherwise grossly clear.
 3. Multiple rib fractures again seen.  No pneumothorax detected.
 4. Right clavicle fracture again noted.
