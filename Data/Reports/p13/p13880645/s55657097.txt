                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with on chemotherapy, new fever/tachycardia  //
 pleaseevaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Port-A-Cath placement ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  The catheter tubing
 appears to full on itself in the supraclavicular region, this is likely due to
 the projection, based on the intraprocedural images but correlation with how
 well line is functioning is recommended to exclude a kink.
 
 Similar in appearance compared to the prior study, prominence of the bilateral
 hila and the pulmonary vascular structures is again noted.  Mild cardiomegaly,
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  No definite pleural effusion seen.  No
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Somewhat unusual appearance of the right-sided Port-A-Cath in the
 supraclavicular fossa is likely projectional but correlation with however line
 is functioning is recommended.  This could also be assessed by obtaining
 slightly oblique views of the area.
 
 Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion.
