                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with plasma cell leukemia  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is within normal limits.  Visualization of the lung bases is
 suboptimal due to overlapping soft tissue structures, however there appears to
 be increased opacity with partial silhouetting of the left heart border
 suspicious for lingular consolidation.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the
 mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Assessment of lung bases is somewhat limited due to the overlapping soft
 tissues, nonetheless increased opacity at the left lung base is suspicious for
 lingular consolidation.
