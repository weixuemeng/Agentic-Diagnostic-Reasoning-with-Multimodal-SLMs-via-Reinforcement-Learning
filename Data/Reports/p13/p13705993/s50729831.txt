 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Lung volumes are slightly low
 and there is persistent eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, limiting
 evaluation of the right lower lobe.  There is bibasilar atelectasis without
 large pleural effusions, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation on single AP view.  However, for full evaluation of the
 right lower lobe, recommend lateral chest x-ray, when the patient is able to
 tolerate.
