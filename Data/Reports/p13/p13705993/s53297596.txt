                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD secondary to polycystic kidney
 disease here for initiation of HD.  // Screening CXR prior to initiation of HD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Degree of inspiration is small with results in crowding of bronchovascular
 markings at the bases, however even taking this into account, there is
 probably some streaky left retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis. No
 parenchymal or hilar mass is seen and no pleural fluid is present. No central
 pulmonary vascular congestion or edema is present and cardiac size is within
 normal limits.  Thoracic vertebral bodies appear demineralized from maintained
 in height alignment.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left retrocardiac subsegmental atelectasis, possibly exaggerated due to small
 lung volumes.
