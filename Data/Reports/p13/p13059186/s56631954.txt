                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aplastic anemia c/b neutropenia with left
 chest wall pain, cough  // please assess for infiltrate/consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Right Port-A-Cath ends in the mid
 SVC.
 
 Worsening, interstitial and alveolar opacities primarily in the right lung.
 Moderate bibasilar atelectasis is moderately worsened.
 
 No pneumothorax.  Small, bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Hilar contours are normal.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening subtle opacities in the right lung could be caused by decrease in
 lung volume and the superimposed medial border of the scapula. However, the
 presence of dorsal opacities on the lateral view mixed the presence of
 pneumonia likely.
