  Right subclavian central venous catheter in improved position with tip in the
  low SVC.  Right basilar pleural pigtail catheter without significant
  pneumothorax.  Improved aeration of the right lung base with persistent
  opacification of the left lung base from the most recent prior study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest tube, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 pigtail catheter with its tip at the cardiophrenic angle.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Substantial reduction in the amount of fluid in the right chest
 with concomitant expanded aeration.  Retrocardiac and left basilar
 opacification persist, consistent with atelectasis and effusion.  
 
 The right central catheter has been re-positioned with the tip in the low SVC.
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in good position.
