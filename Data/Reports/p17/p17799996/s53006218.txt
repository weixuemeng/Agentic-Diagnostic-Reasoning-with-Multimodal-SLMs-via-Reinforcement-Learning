                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of CLL and large pleural effusions, now with cough. 
 Please reassess pleural effusions and also evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A left
 PICC ends in the low SVC, not significantly changed.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right, are both decreased compared to the
 prior radiograph from ___.  Consolidation at the left lung base
 is likely compressive atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Decreased moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
 
 2.  Left lower lung consolidation, likely compressive atelectasis.
