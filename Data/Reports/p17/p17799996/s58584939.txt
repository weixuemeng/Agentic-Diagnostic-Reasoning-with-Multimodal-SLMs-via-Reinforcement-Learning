                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube has been placed that terminates approximately
 3 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube has been placed that terminates
 immediately above the stomach, probably in the distal esophagus.  A left-sided
 PICC line remains in place, but with a turn and its tip projecting upward,
 likely terminating in the azygous vein.  There are increasing moderate to
 large pleural effusions, particularly prominent on the right, as well as
 considerable worsening of hazy pulmonary opacification with an interstitial
 abnormality most suggestive of pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.  
 
 2.  New orogastric tube terminating likely in the distal esophagus.  If
 gastric placement is desired, then advancing the tube by approximately 10 cm
 is suggested.  
 
 3.  PICC line in place with tip projecting over the mid superior vena cava,
 possibly with the tip flipped upward or more likely with azygos vein
 placement.  
 
 4.  Findings suggest moderate worsening pulmonary edema, with increasing
 pleural effusions, particularly on the right side.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 2 am on ___ by telephone.
