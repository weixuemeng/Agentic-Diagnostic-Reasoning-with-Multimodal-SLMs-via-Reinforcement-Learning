                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assessment for pneumothorax in a patient with increasing pressor
 requirement, bilateral pleural effusions and a history of CLL.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___, two
 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed and compared to

 upper enteric tube enters the stomach and ends off of the radiograph.  Left
 internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava, and a left
 subclavian line ends in the lower superior vena cava.  Moderate-to-large left
 and moderate right pleural effusions relatively unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite pneumothorax.
 2.  Moderate-to-large left and moderate right pleural effusions are unchanged.
 3.  The supportive lines and tubes are relatively unchanged in position.
