                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post right VATS with empyema.  One of the
 chest tubes has been removed.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study performed 4 hours earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has
 minimally increased.  Right basal chest tube remains in place.  Right apical
 chest tube has been removed.  As mentioned in prior studies, the presence of a
 deep sulcus sign suggests the presence of a right pneumothorax.  This is
 unchanged from prior studies.  There are no acute interval changes from recent
 prior study.
