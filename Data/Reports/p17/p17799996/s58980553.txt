                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:21 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left empyema.  Left VATS decortication and
 chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, left pigtail pleural catheter has been replaced by three
 left thoracostomy tubes.  The extent of loculated left pleural effusion has
 decreased substantially and the previous left basal pneumothorax is smaller. 
 Atelectasis persists in the left lower lobe.  On the right, a moderate-sized
 pleural effusion has changed in distribution but not in overall severity,
 including a substantial fissural component.  The heart is moderately enlarged
 and unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but it is difficult to say
 if very mild interstitial edema is present.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no
 less than 6 cm from the carina and should be advanced 1 to 2 cm for more
 secured seating.  Left internal jugular line ends in the low SVC.  No right
 pneumothorax.
