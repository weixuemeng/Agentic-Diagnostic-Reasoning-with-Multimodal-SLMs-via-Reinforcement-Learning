                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pleural effusion status post
 chest tube, assess pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 4:03.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 13:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube,
 basilar chest tube are unchanged.  There has been interval placement of a
 right basilar pigtail catheter into the right pleural space, with interval
 decrease in size of a small right effusion.  No right-sided pneumothorax is
 appreciated.  There continues to be air loculated medially and laterally at
 the left lung base.  There is streaky patchy opacity at the left base as well,
 likely reflecting residual atelectasis.  Overall, the pulmonary vasculature
 appears somewhat less well defined, raising concern for superimposed
 interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable.
