 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Acute respiratory distress.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier on the same day and also ___.  Also
 history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  The distal part of a left-sided PICC has flipped upward coursing
 retrograde.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Perihilar fullness and hazy prominent pulmonary vascularity have mildly
 decreased.  Small to moderate pleural effusions persist with patchy basilar
 opacities, not specific, although probably due to atelectasis with low lung
 volumes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Improvement in pulmonary edema.  
 
 2.  Suspected pleural effusions and patchy parenchymal densities likely due to
 atelectasis.  
 
 3.  Tip of PICC line flipped upward terminating recurrently in the upper
 superior vena cava.
