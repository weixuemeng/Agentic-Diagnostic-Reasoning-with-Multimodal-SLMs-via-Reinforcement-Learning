                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right chest tube, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison made to prior study of ___ at 452.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet.  The nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Left
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged.
 There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube with
 improvement in aeration of the left lung and some loculated air along the
 lateral and medial basilar aspects of the lower lobe likely representing
 loculated pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion remains.  There is
 increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity which likely represents
 an element of superimposed mild pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
