                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CLL, hypoxic respiratory distress from pneumosepsis
 complicated by empyema.
 
 CHEST:
 
 The positions of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and pigtail catheter
 are unchanged.  Increased opacities are seen in the right lung indicating
 fluid in the greater and lesser fissures.  Left effusion is also present. 
 Increased retrocardiac density is again noted, consistent with atelectasis,
 though pneumonia is not excluded in this region.  Upper zone redistribution is
 still present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing pleural fluid, particularly in the right greater and
 lesser fissures.
