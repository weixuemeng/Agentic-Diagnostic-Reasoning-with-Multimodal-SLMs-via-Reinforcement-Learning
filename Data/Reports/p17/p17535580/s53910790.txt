                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman HLD, HTN, ___'s esophagus, GERD, anemia,
 now hospitalized with obstructive renal failure and UTI with LUL nodule on
 admission CXR; persistent hypotension  // Monitoring for interval changes of
 LUL nodule
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen left upper lobe nodular opacity is not as well seen in this
 exam, but it probably represents focal calcification at the first rib
 costochondral cartilage. There is mild atelectasis at the left lung base,
 similar to prior. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously seen left upper lobe nodular opacity is not as well seen in this
 exam, but it probably represents focal calcification at the first rib
 costochondral cartilage. Lordotic view chest radiograph is recommended to
 better evaluate whether the opacity is parenchymal or skeletal in origin.
