                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Immunosuppression with cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Less
 prominent changes are seen on the left.  Although this could merely reflect
 pleural effusion and bibasilar compressive atelectasis, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
 
 No evidence of vascular congestion.  Bilateral breast implants are seen.
