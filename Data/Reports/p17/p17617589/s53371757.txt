                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sudden unresponsiveness requiring intubation, here to evaluate ET
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates at the orifice of right mainstem
 bronchus.  An enteric tube passes far into the stomach.  Evaluation of the
 chest is limited due to multiple overlying lines and tubes.  Within this
 limitation, there are widespread interstitial opacities throughout the right
 lung with a basilar predominance as well as the left lung base.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and subtle Kerley B lines suggesting
 interstitial edema.  A small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is detected on this semi-erect view.  The cardiac silhouette is
 incompletely visualized in the setting of bibasilar opacities.  The
 mediastinal contours are prominent due to tortuosity of the thoracic aorta
 with partial calcification of the aortic knob. Densities projecting over the
 right humerus and soft tissues of the upper arm are likely external to the
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right mainstem intubation.  Recommend re-positioning.
 2.  Asymmetric pulmonary interstitial edema and vascular congestion on the
 right greater than the left.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical context.
