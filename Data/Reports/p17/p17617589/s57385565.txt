 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Heart failure, evaluation for tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:59 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously
 malpositioned endotracheal tube has been pulled back.  The tip of the tube now
 projects approximately 3.5-4 cm above the carina.  The course of the
 nasogastric tube is unchanged.  Unchanged appearance of the moderately
 enlarged cardiac silhouette and of the preexisting parenchymal opacities. 
 These have not changed in extent and severity.
