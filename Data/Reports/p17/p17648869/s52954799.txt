                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate multiple sternal wires and a
 normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal, and the lungs are fairly well aerated. There is diffuse interstitial
 edema. Slightly more consolidative opacity in the right infrahilar region may
 represent asymmetric edema or an infectious process. There are bilateral small
 pleural effusions, right greater than left. No pneumothorax is seen. The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse interstitial edema. Slightly more consolidative opacity in the
 right infrahilar region may represent asymmetric edema or superimposed
 pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard
 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
