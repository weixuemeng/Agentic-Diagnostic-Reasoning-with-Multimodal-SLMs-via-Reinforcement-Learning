                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with acute nontraumatic left elbow pain for 24
 hours.  Evaluate for acute process or edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy, and multiple surgical clips
 likely reflect prior bypass surgery.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and interstitial edema, slightly improved from prior exam.  The
 right lung base opacity is again noted which could reflect asymmetric edema or
 pneumonia.  The heart is top-normal in size, and calcifications of the aortic
 arch are again seen.  No pneumothorax is seen, and there are small bilateral
 pleural effusions, smaller since prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  Right lung base
 opacity could reflect asymmetric edema or possible pneumonia.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
