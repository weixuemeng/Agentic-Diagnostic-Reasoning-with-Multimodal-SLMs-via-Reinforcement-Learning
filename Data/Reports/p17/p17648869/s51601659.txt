                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact appearing
 wires. The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusion,
 right greater than the left are similar to ___. Opacities at the
 right lung base are slightly increased from the prior study. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with top-normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette and unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Mild calcification of
 the aortic knob is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema with slightly
 increased opacities in the right lung base compared to ___, which
 may represent asymmetric edema or superimposed pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the
 left.
