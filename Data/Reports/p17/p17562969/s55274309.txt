                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up right lower lung opacity.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Bibasilar opacities have markedly improved, still larger on the right.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are small.  The lungs are better inflated.  Patient has emphysema.  Left rib
 fractures are again noted. Increased density of the right scapula is due to an
 old trauma.
