                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dementia and gastroenteritis.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph, the previously seen opacity at the
 right base has returned, suggesting possible aspiration, although infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Again noted is tortuosity of the aorta.  Severe
 degenerative changes of the shoulder are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Reappearance of right basilar opacification suggests ongoing aspiration,
 although infectious process cannot be excluded.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
