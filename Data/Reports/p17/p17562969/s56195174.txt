                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recurrent fevers, evaluation for pneumonia, rule out acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing right
 parenchymal opacities have increased in extent and have a more nodular
 appearance than on the previous image.  These changes support the suspicion of
 pneumonia.
 
 The left lung base is unremarkable.  Unchanged moderate enlargement of the
 left atrium and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Unchanged multiple probably
 non-recent rib fractures.  No pulmonary edema.
