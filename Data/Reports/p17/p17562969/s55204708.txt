                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left internal jugular vascular catheter has been withdrawn
 slightly, and now terminates in the proximal superior vena cava with the
 distal tip directed laterally within the structure.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  New patchy opacities have developed at both lung
 bases, and could reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  Followup radiographs may
 be helpful to exclude developing pneumonia if warranted clinically. 
 Asymmetrical left apical thickening probably corresponds to extrapleural fat
 and parenchymal scarring shown on cervical CT of ___.
