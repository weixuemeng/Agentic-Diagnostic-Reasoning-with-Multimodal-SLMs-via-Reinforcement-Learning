                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with low oxygen saturation, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph was provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Compared to the prior study, there is mild prominence of
 vascular markings likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema.  Opacities at the
 bases are mostly unchanged and are most likely atelectasis.  Again seen is a
 tortuous calcified aorta.  The remainder of the cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  There are severe degenerative changes in the shoulders bilaterally
 and old rib fractures on the left.  There is dextroscoliosis of the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite focal consolidation.  Possible mild pulmonary edema. 
 Opacities at the bases are likely atelectasis.
