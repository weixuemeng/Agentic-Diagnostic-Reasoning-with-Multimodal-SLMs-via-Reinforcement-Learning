                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Unwitnessed fall with tenderness to palpation along the left
 lateral chest wall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT abdomen  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is top
 normal with a left ventricular predominance.  The aorta remains diffusely
 calcified and tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is
 minimal streaky opacity within the lung bases, likely reflecting atelectasis. 
 No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is present.  No definite
 pneumothorax is seen.  No displaced rib fractures are noted.  Extensive
 degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are present.  There appears
 to be retained barium within colonic diverticula in the left upper quadrant of
 the abdomen.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures are noted and were present
 when compared to the prior CT abdomen from ___, but no acute
 fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic traumatic injury definitively noted.  If
 there is continued clinical concern for acute rib fracture, consider a
 dedicated rib series.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
