 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is increased density projecting
 over the left hilum.  This is thought to be due to superimposed atelectasis in
 the left lung given lack of significant change since ___ taking
 into account lower lung volumes and new elevation of left hemidiaphragm. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  No displaced rib fracture identified.  Changes of DISH seen in the
 spine, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  No visualized displaced rib
 fracture.  However, dedicated rib series can be performed if high clinical
 suspicion.
