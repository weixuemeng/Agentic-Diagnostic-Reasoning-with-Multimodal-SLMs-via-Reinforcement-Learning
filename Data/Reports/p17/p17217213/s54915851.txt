                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, dysuria, tachycardia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear opacity within
 the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is chronic.  Right lung is clear.  Previously noted ill-defined
 hazy opacity in the medial right apex appears improved.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.  Previously described hazy opacity within the medial
 right apex appears improved.  Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
