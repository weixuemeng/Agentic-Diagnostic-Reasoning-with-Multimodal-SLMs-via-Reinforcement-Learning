                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness and multiple falls
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Linear
 opacity in the left mid lung field likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring, unchanged. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect
 atelectasis.  Infection, however, cannot be completely excluded. No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities
 visualized. There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 completely excluded
