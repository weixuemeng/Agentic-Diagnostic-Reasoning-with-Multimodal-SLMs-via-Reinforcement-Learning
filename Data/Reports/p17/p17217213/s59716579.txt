                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Heart size
 is mildly enlarged, but potentially accentuated due to low lung volumes.
 Mediastinal contour is similar. There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but without overt
 pulmonary edema. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is identified although the
 right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No pneumothorax
 is clearly seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with exclusion of the right costophrenic angle. Low lung volumes
 with left basilar atelectasis and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
