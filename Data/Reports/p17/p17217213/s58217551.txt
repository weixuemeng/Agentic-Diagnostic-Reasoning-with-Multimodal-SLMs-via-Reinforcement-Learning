                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall and head strike and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours remain
 unchanged. Bronchovascular structures are crowded without overt pulmonary
 edema. Streaky opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are re- demonstrated in the imaged
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacity in the left lung base, likely atelectasis. Infection cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
