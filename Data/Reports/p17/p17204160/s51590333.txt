                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dizziness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Query subtle focal opacity projecting over the right upper lobe medial to the
 EKG lead, may be artifactual from external artifact although an underlying
 focus of infection is not excluded.  Elsewhere, no focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is mild left base atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle focal opacity projecting over the right upper lung, projecting over the
 right anterior 2nd rib which could relate to external artifact, but focus of
 infection not excluded.  Consider repeat with removal of external artifact in
 this region.
