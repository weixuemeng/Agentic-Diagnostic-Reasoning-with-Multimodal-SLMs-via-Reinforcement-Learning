                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier the same date, at 12:19.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There is minimal left apical pleural thickening again seen.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Please note that the
 questionable focus of opacity projecting over the right anterior second rib is
 no longer present and thus likely artifactual on the prior study.
