 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  There is elevation of the left

 configuration.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but similar compared to prior. 
 Orthopedic hardware partially visualized in the proximal right humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity due to any combination of effusion,
 atelectasis or underlying infection.  Massive dilation of the pulmonary
 arterial tree similar to prior.
