                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF COPD // pleural effusions, PNA pleural
 effusions, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The large left pleural effusion and  left lung collapse causing complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax are unchanged. Increasing airspace
 opacity in the right lung is concerning for pneumonia. Cross-sectional imaging
 would be helpful to clarify the relative contributions of effusion, collapse,
 and consolidation and evaluate for possible bronchial obstruction. Right-sided
 pleural effusion is small is present at all. There is a   well-healed proximal
 right humeral fracture with partially imaged stabilizing intramedullary rod.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increasing possible right pneumonia.
 2. Persistent left lung collapse and pleural effusion. Chest CT could  clarify
 the extent of effusion, collapse, and consolidation and evaluate possible
 bronchial obstruction.
