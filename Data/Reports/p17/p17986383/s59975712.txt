                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, hypoxia.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, 9:28 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral upright chest radiographs. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to radiograph 40 minutes prior, no significant interval
 change seen.  Again seen is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 associated left basilar opacity which is a combination of moderate sized left
 pleural effusion, basilar atelectasis, and possible underlying infection.  The
 right lung is clear.  No change in severely dilated pulmonary arteries or
 enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pneumothorax. Vertical rod with
 screws in the right humerus again seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.   No significant change compared to 40 minutes prior.
 
 2.   Left basilar opacity, likely represents a combination of moderate sized
 left pleural effusion, atelectasis and possible underlying infection. 
 Clinical correlation is recommended.  
 
 3.  No change in severely dilated pulmonary arteries.
