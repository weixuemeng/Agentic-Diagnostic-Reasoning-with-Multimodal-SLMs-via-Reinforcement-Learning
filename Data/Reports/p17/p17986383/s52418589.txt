                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  To evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT.
 
 When compared to prior study, a right-sided central line has been removed. 
 Patient's orthopedic hardware is again noted in the right shoulder as is
 modeling deformity here.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged, although this is an AP radiograph.  Unfolding of
 the thoracic aorta is again seen.  Allowing for technique and projection, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  The osseous structures show a dorsal kyphosis.  On
 the lateral view there is a reasonably well identified posterior rounded
 opacity, present on study dated ___ and which likely reflects the
 chronic right-sided nodules known to be present in this patient.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No definitive acute findings.  Extensive chronic changes of pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  No definitive acute findings.
