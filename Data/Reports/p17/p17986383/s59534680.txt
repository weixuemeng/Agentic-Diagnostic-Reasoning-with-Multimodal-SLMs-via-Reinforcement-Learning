                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pulmonary hypertension, now
 presenting with hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory distress with worsening lung
 examination.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position.
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  Cardiac enlargement and configurational changes
 compatible with pulmonary hypertension remain.  The pulmonary congestive
 pattern; however, has markedly improved and so have the previous examination's
 suspected multifocal pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  The lateral pleural
 sinuses remain free, so significant pleural effusion is unlikely.  No
 pneumothorax in the apical area.
 
 The relatively rapid improvement of the previously-described pulmonary
 findings suggests that they were mainly related to CHF and atypical appearance
 of pulmonary edema.  As there are some hazy parenchymal densities persisting
 in the right middle lung field and the left upper lobe area, further followup
 is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Marked improvement of pulmonary congestive pattern and parenchymal densities,
 most likely the result of successful treatment of CHF.
