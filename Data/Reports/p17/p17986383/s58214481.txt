                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 EXAMINATION:  Single frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Asymmetrically distributed multifocal opacification is increased since
 ___, particularly involving the left upper lobe, though also within the
 right upper lobe and right lower lobe.  There is a more nodular opacity
 demonstrated within the right upper lobe which has been previously
 demonstrated since at least ___.  There are no large pleural effusions
 or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable,
 demonstrating borderline cardiomegaly.  There is marked enlargement of the
 main pulmonary artery, indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening multifocal opacification. Recommend clinical correlation for
 infection, and in the absence of concern for infection, CT of the chest is
 recommended to exclude the possibility of malignancy.  
 2.  Pulmonary artery enlargement compatible with pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 2 p.m. on ___ via
 telephone by Dr. ___ ___ telephone.
