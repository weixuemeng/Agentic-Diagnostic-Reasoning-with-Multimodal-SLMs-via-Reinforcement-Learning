                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in
 comparison with prior study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderately enlarged cardiomegaly and massively dilated bilateral pulmonary
 artery, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension, are unchanged in
 severity since prior radiograph.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Ill-defined nodule in the right upper lung measuring 1.3 x 1.4 cm has grown
 since ___ when it was seen as a very inconspicuous opacity.  This
 nodule should be further evaluated with chest CT to rule out a possibility of
 lung malignancy.  Degenerative changes are seen at multiple thoracic vertebral
 levels.  Mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  An irregular spiculated nodule of 1.2 x 1.3 cm in the right upper lung has
 grown since ___ when it was highly inconspicuous.  Chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly and enlarged bilateral pulmonary arteries suggestive
 of pulmonary artery hypertension.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the significance of this
 nodule, and recommendation of chest CT on ___ at 4:36 p.m.
