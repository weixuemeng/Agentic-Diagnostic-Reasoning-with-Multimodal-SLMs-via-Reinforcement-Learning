                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, rule out acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and an
 increase in AP diameter, consistent with chronic lung disease.  Heart remains
 moderately enlarged.  There is prominence of the central vasculature with a
 mild increase in the pulmonary interstitial vasculature, compatible with mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia. Pleural effusions are minimal, if any.
 
 Rounded opacity projecting over the mid thoracic spine, in the right upper
 lobe, is probably unchanged from ___. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries is
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The overall morphology of
 the hilar and mediastinal structures is unchanged.
 
 A right humeral fixation rod is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.
