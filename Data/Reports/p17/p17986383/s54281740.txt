 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF and COPD.  // assess interval change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Clearing of the left lung apex is probably due to improving pulmonary edema.
 Large left pleural effusion is slightly smaller. Both lower lobes are
 consolidated, but whether this is pneumonia or dependent edema and atelectasis
 is radiographically indeterminate. Severe cardiomegaly, distended mediastinal
 veins, and huge pulmonary arteries are chronic.
