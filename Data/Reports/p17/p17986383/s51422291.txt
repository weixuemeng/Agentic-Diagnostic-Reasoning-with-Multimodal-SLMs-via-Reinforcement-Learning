                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF exacerbation requiring BIPAP  // eval
 for worsening pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiographs of ___, there is stable
 moderate cardiomegaly, and a large stable left pleural effusion.  Lung volumes
 are low on the present study causing bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for
 this, the mild pulmonary edema in the left upper lung field is unchanged.
 There is mildly increased density in the right lung field, which may represent
 slight progression of right-sided pulmonary edema, though the interval change
 may be attributable to differences in lung volumes. The right pleural effusion
 has likely grown as it now extends into the horizontal fissure. The pulmonary
 arteries remain enlarged suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased density in the right lung field may represent slight progression
 of pulmonary edema or may be attributable to low lung volumes.
 2. Likely increase in the small to moderate right pleural effusion, which now
 extends into the horizontal fissure.
 3. Stable cardiomegaly, enlarged pulmonary arteries, left pleural effusion,
 and left-sided pulmonary edema.
