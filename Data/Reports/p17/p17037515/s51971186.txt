                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough for one month.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Increased interstitial markings are again noted diffusely bilaterally, which
 is unchanged when compared to the prior exams and may be chronic or suggestive
 of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion is noted,
 with more focal opacity in the right lung base which may represent area of
 developing infection.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are degenerative
 changes in both acromioclavicular joints as well as within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued bilateral diffuse increased interstitial markings,
 which may reflect chronic changes or mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  More
 focal opacity within the right lung base may represent an area of infection,
 with a small right pleural effusion.
