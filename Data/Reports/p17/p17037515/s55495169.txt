                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old gentleman with shortness of breath and abdominal
 pain, assess for pneumonia or edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 slightly lower in volume than on the previous examination with interval
 increase in its interstitial opacity which suggests mild pulmonary edema.  In
 this context, subtle pneumonia could be obscured.  The heart remains mildly
 enlarged with tortuous aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Changes of emphysema with mild superimposed pulmonary edema.  If
 continued concern for pneumonia, consider diuresis and repeat imaging.
