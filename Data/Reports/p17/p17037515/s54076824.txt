                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of interstitial lung disease, on chronic ventilation, now
 with worsening hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiograph dated
 ___ obtained approximately one hour prior and review of chest CT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  In comparison with the most recent radiograph
 obtained one hour prior, there is no significant interval change in widespread
 diffuse parenchymal opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema.  More focal areas
 of opacification are present including at the left base as well as to a lesser
 extent at the right base such that infection cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is likely significant atelectasis at the left base.  A left pleural
 effusion may also be present.
 
 Endotracheal tube is in standard position.  An esophageal catheter courses
 inferior to the diaphragm with tip in the stomach and side port near the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Gaseous distention of several bowel loops is
 partially imaged.  The heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.
