                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right-sided pneumonia, small pleural effusion.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The heart size is within normal limits and mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Coarsened interstitial markings in the lungs raise the
 question of a chronic intersitial lung disease.  There is an improved
 appearance of the right lower lobe consolidation, although a residual
 component remains.  Trace right pleural fluid also remains.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
