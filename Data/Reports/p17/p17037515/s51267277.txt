                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right IJ catheter
 terminates in the low SVC.  NG tube appears to terminate below the diaphragm. 
 Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Heterogeneous bilateral
 widespread opacities are similar to the prior exam, taking into account the
 patient position, and compatible with mild pulmonary edema with superimposed
 multifocal pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal infection superimpose on mild pulmonary edema, similar
 to prior.
