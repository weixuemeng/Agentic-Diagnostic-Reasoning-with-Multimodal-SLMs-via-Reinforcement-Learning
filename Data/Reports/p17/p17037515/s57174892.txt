                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Basilar interstitial opacities appear
 increased from prior.  Findings likely reflect superimposed mild edema on
 underlying interstitial lung disease or possibly simply progression of the
 chronic lung disease.  No confluent opacity is identified to suggest
 pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Cardiac contours remain mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial basilar opacities which likely reflects
 progression of underlying chronic lung disease and some mild superimposed
 pulmonary edema.
