                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:44 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of right-sided weakness and facial droop.  Received TPA.
 Converted to hemorrhagic stroke, ventilatory dependent respiratory failure. 
 Assess lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement reflects cardiac
 decompensation.  Deposition of edema may explain the increase in the extent of
 consolidation in the right lower lobe, but since that consolidation preceded
 edema, it should be considered pneumonia until proved otherwise. 
 Consolidation in the left lower lobe has improved, reflected in better
 definition in the descending thoracic aorta.  This is presumably atelectasis,
 given the interval change.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Left subclavian or PIC line ends low in the
 SVC, and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.  Shunt catheter traverses the right neck, chest, and upper abdomen.  No
 pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.
