 INDICATION:  Hypoxia. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widening of the right mediastinum is likely due to accentuation of tortuous
 vessels by slight rotation based upon review of older CT torso ___.
 There is focal left linear basilar scar without change from the prior CT.
 Opacity projecting over the anterior lower spine on lateral view is likely due
 to a prominent bridging osteophyte.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
