                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal and chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low.  There is a new wedge-shaped opacity within the
 posterior aspect of the left lower lobe, projecting over the spine on the
 lateral radiograph, possibly representing a pulmonary infarction given the
 patient's history of pulmonary embolism (as seen on CT from ___).  Band-like parenchymal opacity extending from the left hilum, at the
 level of the left upper lobe, is not significantly changed in appearance.  A
 nodular right upper lung opacity projecting over the right second intercostal
 space, is slightly decreased in size compared to prior radiograph from
 ___.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  A small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Wedge-shaped left lower lobe opacity, concerning for a pulmonary
 infarction, as seen on prior chest CTA.
 
 2.  Decreased size of right upper lung nodular opacity, possibly
 infectious/inflammatory in nature, although a neoplastic process is certainly
 not excluded.  Unchanged band-like opacities radiating from the left hilum,
 better evaluated on prior CT.
