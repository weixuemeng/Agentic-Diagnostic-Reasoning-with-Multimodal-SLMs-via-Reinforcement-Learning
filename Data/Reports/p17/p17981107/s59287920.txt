                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Metastatic lung cancer, history of bilateral
 pulmonary embolism, chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the same day earlier on ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in contour.  Hilar mass and left
 linear atelectasis are unchanged.  Left lower lung posterior opacity is better
 appreciated on the lateral view projecting over the spine.  Although findings
 may potentially represent cavitating pulmonary infarct, infectious process in
 this patient is a possibility.  This finding corresponds to previously seen
 opacity in this location on the prior scan, but an infarct should be resolved
 within a month's period of time unless the current pulmonary embolism is
 expected.  Correlation with patient's symptoms is recommended.
