 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small-cell lung cancer, abdominal pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Normal lung volumes, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 known left lower lobe pneumonia is barely apparent on the frontal radiograph,
 but is better seen on the lateral radiograph.  The extent of the pneumonia has
 minimally decreased, but is still clearly visible.  Unchanged is a band-like
 parenchymal opacity emanating from the left hilus, at the level of the left
 upper lobe.  In addition, on today's radiograph, a 1 cm rounded opacity has
 newly appeared in the right upper lobe, projecting over the ventral part of
 the second rib.
 
 Overall, notably given the clinical history of the patient, further short-term
 radiographic followup may be considered, as multifocal pneumonia, potentially
 combined with malignancy, as possible.  At the time of observation and
 dictation, 8:05 a.m., the referring physician, ___. ___, was paged for
 notification on ___.
