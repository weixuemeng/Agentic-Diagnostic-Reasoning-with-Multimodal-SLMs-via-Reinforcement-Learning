                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with recent oopherectomy, SOB, wheezing, positive ddimer bnp
 trop, evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse hazy opacification of bilateral lung fields is associated with
 moderate cardiomegaly suggesting moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. 
 Interstitial lung disease can also have this appearance.  More confluent right
 lung base airspace opacification may represent a superimposed infectious
 process or atelectasis, depending on the clinical setting.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate pulmonary interstitial edema.
 2. Possible superimposed infectious process or atelectasis involving the right
 lung base.
