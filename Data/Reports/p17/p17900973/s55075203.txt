 projects leads into the right atrium and ventricle.  The heart size is top
 normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There
 is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.  No acute
 fractures are seen, although this technique is suboptimal for evaluation of
 osseous trauma.
