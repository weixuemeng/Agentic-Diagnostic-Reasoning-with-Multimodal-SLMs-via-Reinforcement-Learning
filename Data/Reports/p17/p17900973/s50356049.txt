                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoglycemia and confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained. Lower lung volumes contribute
 to vascular crowding at the lung bases, making it hard to exclude early edema.
 No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Dual chamber pacing leads project over the
 expected chambers of the heart. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Cannot exclude early pulmonary edema.
