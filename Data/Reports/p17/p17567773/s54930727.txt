                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Mild hyperexpansion of the
 lungs suggests underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no evidence of
 acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
