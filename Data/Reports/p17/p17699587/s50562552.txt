                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again, there is volume loss in the right lung as compared to the left. Right
 cardiophrenic angle haziness is stable. Relative haziness of the right lung as
 compared to the left likely relates to volume loss. No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 Partially imaged left humeral prosthesis is noted.
