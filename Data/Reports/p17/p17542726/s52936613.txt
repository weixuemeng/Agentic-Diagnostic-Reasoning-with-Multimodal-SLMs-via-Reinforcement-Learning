                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is a patchy left basilar opacity obscuring the left cardiac border,
 probably within both the left lower lobe and lingula but not significantly
 changed and accordingly perhaps chronic.  It is difficult to exclude a
 recurrent opacity at the same location, however.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basilar opacities, possibly due to chronic
 scarring or atelectasis noting the lack of change, although it is difficult to
 exclude the possibility of recurring infection at the same location as before.
