 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of dizziness, weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left greater

 aspiration, although underlying pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, more so on the left, could relate to
 atelectasis or/and aspiration, although underlying pneumonia is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
