                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are hyperinflated with
 marked emphysematous changes again demonstrated, most pronounced at the lung
 apices.  Increased interstitial markings are noted diffusely bilaterally,
 likely representing chronic changes with mild superimposed interstitial edema.
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation.  Multiple clips are demonstrated overlying the posterior spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Severe emphysema with increased interstitial markings bilaterally
 suggestive of mild interstitial edema superimposed on chronic changes.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
