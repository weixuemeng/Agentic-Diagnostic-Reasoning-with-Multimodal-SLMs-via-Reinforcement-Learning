                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ogt positioning  // ogt positioning
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated lordotic positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  An OG tube
 is present, tip and side-port overlying the stomach.  A left subclavian PICC
 line tip overlies the region of the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.  Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A small left effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, similar to the
 prior film, without overt CHF.
 
 On the right, no focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.  The previously
 seen dense band at the right base has resolved.
 
 Adjacent in the soft tissues lateral to the mid left chest wall there is a
 linear density measuring 9.7 mm long that appears metallic.  It is not known
 whether this overlies are lies within the patient.  Clinical correlation
 requested.  No corresponding density is seen on the chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 OG tube tip and side-port lie below the diaphragm, overlying the stomach.
 
 Continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A small left
 effusion cannot be excluded.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution and slight vascular blurring, without overt
 CHF, similar to prior.
 
 9.7 mm metallic density overlying the soft tissues lateral to the left mid
 chest wall -- ?  Artifact overlying the patient versus a new foreign body.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings regarding the small metallic density adjacent to the
 left chest wall were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___, one
 of the covering clinicians in the CCU, by phone, ___ min after discovery at
 21:02 on ___
