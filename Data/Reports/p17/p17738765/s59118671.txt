 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  The
 lungs are well-expanded.  Mild increased patchy opacity at the right lung
 base, new since the prior study may reflect early aspiration or pneumonia.
