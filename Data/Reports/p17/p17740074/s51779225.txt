                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with recent pneumonia, now improved.  Evaluate
 for resolution of infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Compared to the
 most recent prior study, there has been improvement of multifocal opacities in
 the lower lung with some residual opacities remaining.  There is scarring in
 the right upper lobe with a new opacity in the apex and associated upward
 retraction of the right hilus, compatible with prior TB.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  The imaged upper abdomen is normal.  The bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved multifocal opacities in the lower lung with some residual
 opacities remaining.
 2.  Scarring in the right upper lobe, compatible with prior TB.
