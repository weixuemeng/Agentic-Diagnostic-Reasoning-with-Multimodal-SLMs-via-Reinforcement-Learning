                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest wall tenderness, here to evaluate for rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  No acute, displaced rib fracture is detected.  The inspiratory lung
 volumes are low with resultant accentuation of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  No significant pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes.  There is no
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No acute, displaced rib fracture detected.  If there is persistent pain and
 clinical concern, a dedicated rib series is recommended with a BB overlying
 the area of patient's tenderness.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
