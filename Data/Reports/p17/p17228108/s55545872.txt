 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:59 PM
  Compared to the study 2 days ago, there is slightly increased opacity in the
  right lower lobe, blurring the right hemidiaphragmatic contour.  Although this
  could be atelectasis, given the previous pneumonia at this site, it could mean
  worsening of the infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers again, question new focal
 opacity.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A left-sided PICC line has been placed, tip over distal SVC, unchanged.
 
 There is some hazy opacity at the right base, slightly more pronounced than on
 the most recent film from ___ and new compared with ___, raising
 the question of a new infectious infiltrate or less likely focus of
 aspiration.  There is atelectasis at both lung bases.  No other focal opacity
 identified.  No gross effusion or CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged, allowing for lower lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New or more pronounced opacity at the right base could represent
 atelectasis, but it appears more confluent than on ___ and the differential
 diagnosis includes a developing pneumonic infiltrate.
