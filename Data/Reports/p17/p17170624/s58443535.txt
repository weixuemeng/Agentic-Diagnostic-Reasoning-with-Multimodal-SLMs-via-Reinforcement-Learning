                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Remote lung cancer with resection, now with coarse breath sounds.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Dramatic opacification of the right hemithorax with displacement of
 mediastinal structures to the right, consistent with the history of prior
 resection.  The left lung is essentially clear with no evidence of acute
 pneumonia.
