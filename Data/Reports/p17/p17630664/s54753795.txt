 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post TEE and OG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 9:11 a.m.
 
 The endotracheal tube, right IJ central line are unchanged in position.  There
 is a feeding tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction.  The side
 port is just a few centimeters below the GE junction and this could be
 advanced a few centimeters for more optimal placement.  There are low lung
 volumes and atelectasis at the lung bases.  The heart size is within normal
 limits and unchanged.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  There is a humeral
 prosthesis.
