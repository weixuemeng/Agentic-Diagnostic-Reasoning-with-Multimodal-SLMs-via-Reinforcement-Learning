                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post nasogastric tube placement.  Assess position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 2:45 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 The endotracheal tube ends 2.6 cm above the level of the carina.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC.  A large bore
 left internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC.  An enteric
 catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field-of-view
 inferiorly.  The side hole of the enteric catheter is just below the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Note is made of a prosthetic valve.  Midline
 sternotomy wires are intact.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  Minimal
 pulmonary edema is not significantly changed.  A wedge-shaped opacity along
 the medial aspect of the right lower lobe is slightly improved.  Band-like
 subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe is not significantly
 changed.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Bilateral shoulder hardware is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable positioning of lines and tubes with enteric catheter coursing below
 the diaphragm and out of the field-of-view inferiorly.
 
 2.  Improved wedge-shaped right lower lung opacity and unchanged mild
 interstial pulmonary edema.
