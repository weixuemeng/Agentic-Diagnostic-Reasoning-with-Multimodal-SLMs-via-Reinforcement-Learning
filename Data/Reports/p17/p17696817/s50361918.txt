 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with polycythemia ___ and intermittent fevers
 now with acute tachypnea and cough c/f PNA versus aspiration.  // Please
 assess for pneumonia, pulmonary edema     Please assess for pneumonia,
 pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is more
 prominent and there is worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 hemidiaphragms are not sharply seen, raising the possibility of pleural fluid
 and mild basilar atelectasis.
 Although there is no definite focal consolidation, in view of the extensive
 pulmonary changes it would be extremely difficult to exclude pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
