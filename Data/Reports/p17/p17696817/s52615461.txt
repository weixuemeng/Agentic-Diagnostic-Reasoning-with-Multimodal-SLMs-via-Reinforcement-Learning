                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with polycythemia ___ p/w anemia and possible AML 
 // eval for CHF, pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are
 within normal limits considering this factor and rightward patient rotation. 
 The aorta is tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs are grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute intrathoracic abnormality on this limited study.  Repeat radiograph
 with improved positioning and greater inspiratory effort may be helpful for
 more complete assessment of the thorax when the patient is clinically able.
