                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Crohn's disease with
 previous interstitial pneumonitis, now with two months of cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  It is difficult to exclude
 subtle interstitial changes in the absence of prior chest radiograph for
 comparison.  There is impression of increased interstitial markings in the
 lung bases, better seen on the PA views as opposed to lateral view, in
 particular in the left lower lobe.  Giving the patient history and complaints,
 HRCT would be an appropriate next step that would also provide a comparison
 with chest CT obtained on ___.
