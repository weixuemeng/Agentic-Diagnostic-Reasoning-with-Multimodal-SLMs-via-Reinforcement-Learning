  Interval placement of Y stent, right IJ line, both in expected locations. 
  Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian line unchanged.  There is no
  penumothorax.  Post RUL lobectomy changes are unchanged. Decreased lung
  aeration with bibasilar opacities, likely layering effusions with superimposed
  atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post Y stent.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 01:32.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a Y stent.  There has also
 been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter, large bore,
 terminating in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax seen.  Midline tracheostomy
 tube is again seen.  Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is stable
 in position given differences in patient positioning.  Scope device previously
 projecting over the esophagus has been removed in the interval.  There is
 stable right upper lobe opacity consistent with post-lobectomy changes.  There
 has been interval increase in bibasilar opacities which may be due to
 worsening atelectasis and aspiration, although developing infection is not
 excluded.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to small
 pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly more
 prominent as compared to the prior study, although this may in part relate to
 lower lung volumes.  Attention at followup.  
 
 There is a thin tubular structure which may represent a subcutaneous line
 which projects over the right axilla but does not extend more proximally than
 the axillary region.  Clinical correlation advised.
