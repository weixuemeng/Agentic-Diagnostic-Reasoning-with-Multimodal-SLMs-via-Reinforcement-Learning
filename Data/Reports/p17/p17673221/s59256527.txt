                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right upper lobectomy for lung cancer and chest tube x1
 in place for pneumothorax.  Status post PEA arrest, evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with stable right
 apical pneumothorax with a right apical chest tube remaining in place.  Again
 demonstrated is widening of the superior mediastinum which developed
 postoperatively and is likely due to shifting of the mediastinum secondary to
 volume loss from right upper lobectomy.  There is no focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion.  A right
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC.  The
 endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, with tip 5.5 cm cranial to the
 carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right apical pneumothorax.  Unchanged widening of the
 superior mediastinum likely due to volume loss from right upper lobectomy.
