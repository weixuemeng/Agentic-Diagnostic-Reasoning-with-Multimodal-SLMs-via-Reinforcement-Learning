                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, hemoptysis, fever and chills.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous and calcified. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Bilateral lower lobe airspace
 opacities are concerning for infection, though in the setting of hemoptysis,
 hemorrhage can cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine as well as within the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Given the
 patient's history of hemoptysis, however, hemorrhage can have a similar
 appearance.
