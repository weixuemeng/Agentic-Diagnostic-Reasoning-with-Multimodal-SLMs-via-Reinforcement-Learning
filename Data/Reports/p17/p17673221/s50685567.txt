                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with lung cancer, bronchiectasis, status post
 stent.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and torso CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.  A
 Y-stent is in unchanged position. A left central venous catheter terminates in
 the upper SVC.  There is a stable right upper lobe opacity consistent with
 right upper lobectomy.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Persistent
 mediastinal widening is due to distention of the mediastinal veins suggesting
 a component of volume overload. The right lung is however better aerated.
 There is mild pulmonary edema of the left lung. Small right pleural effusion
 is unchanged. There is no large pneumothorax. The gastric fundus is distended.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the right lung with continued mild pulmonary
 edema of the left lung.
