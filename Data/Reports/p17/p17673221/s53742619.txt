                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:01 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with lung carcinoma and tracheostomy.  Increased
 hypoxia, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild edema developed in the left lung between ___ and ___ and has not
 changed.  Right lung shows a far greater opacification, due in part to
 increasing overlying moderate right pleural effusion.  The interval increase
 in caliber of moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal veins suggests strong
 component of volume overload, asymmetric edema may explain right lung
 findings, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Tracheostomy tube and left
 subclavian line are in standard placements.  A supraclavicular central venous
 dialysis set ends in the mid-to-low right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
