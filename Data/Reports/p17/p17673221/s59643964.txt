                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer.  Evaluate endotracheal tube and NG tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains in unchanged position and is likely in
 appropriate position, although its relation to the carina is not well
 evaluated on today's examination.  A right subclavian central venous catheter
 remains in unchanged position with tip at the low SVC.  Right-sided chest tube
 remains in position at the right apex with unchanged persistent right moderate
 apical pneumothorax.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is unchanged since
 prior study with mild rightward shift of the mediastinal structures of unclear
 etiology.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Appropriate position of tubes and lines.
 2.  Unchanged right apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
 3.  Unchanged widening of the superior mediastinum of unclear etiology but
 likely due to volume loss from lobectomy.
