                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube, with persistent
 moderate right apical pneumothorax, with visceral pleural line at the level of
 the third posterior right rib, not appreciably changed allowing for positional
 differences of the patient.  Lung volumes are slightly improved compared to
 previous study with associated improved aeration at the right lung base. 
 Otherwise, no relevant short interval changes since the previous study
 performed about one hour earlier.
