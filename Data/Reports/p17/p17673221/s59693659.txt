                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Bradycardia, COPD, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency and flattened diaphragm suggesting
 underlying COPD.  A nodular vague opacity projecting over the left lower lung
 likely reflects a prominent nipple shadow in this patient with mild
 gynecomastia.  There is no definite sign of pneumonia, CHF, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.  Aorta is unfolded, though this
 appears stable.  Heart is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No signs of pneumonia.  Emphysema again noted.
