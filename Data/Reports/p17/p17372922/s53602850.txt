                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates lung volumes which are
 significantly decreased from prior radiograph.  There is no definite pulmonary
 edema, and diffusely increased opacity may be secondary to vascular crowding. 
 Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis and probable bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Decreased lung volumes result in vascular crowding, without definite pulmonary
 edema.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent a combination of bilateral
 pleural effusions and atelectasis.
 
 These findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ at approximately ___ and ___ on ___.
