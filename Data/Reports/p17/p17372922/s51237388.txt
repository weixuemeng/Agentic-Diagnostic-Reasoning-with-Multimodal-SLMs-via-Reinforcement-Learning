                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:16 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe pancreatitis, evaluate for
 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 12:34.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 4:16 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lung volumes remain diminished with patchy streaky opacities at both bases
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  There are stable small bilateral effusions,
 right greater than left.  Vasculature does appear to be somewhat cephalized
 which likely reflects underlying pulmonary venous hypertension.  However, no
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Biapical radiopaque nodular opacities may
 represent calcified granulomas given the presence of mediastinal calcified
 lymphadenopathy on a recent chest CT dated ___ consistent with prior
 granulomatous infection.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 No pneumothorax.
