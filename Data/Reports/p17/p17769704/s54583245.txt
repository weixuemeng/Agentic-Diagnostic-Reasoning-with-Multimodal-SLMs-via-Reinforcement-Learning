 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, it is still very difficult
 to evaluate the nasogastric tube, which extends at least to the level of the
 esophagogastric junction. For better evaluation, a repeat study using
 abdominal technique with the upper margin at the carina with clearly show the
 tip of the tube. Otherwise, little change.
