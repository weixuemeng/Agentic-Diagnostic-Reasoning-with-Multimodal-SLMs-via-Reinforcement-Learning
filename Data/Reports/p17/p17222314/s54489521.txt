                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung cancer with hemoptysis, to assess for right hilar mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there
 is some increase in opacification at the right base consistent with
 combination of atelectasis and effusion.  There is again opacification in the
 right infrahilar region consistent with apparent known mass.  The left lung is
 relatively clear and there is no definite vascular congestion in this patient
 with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and pacer device.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
