 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___ at 18:37 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.6 cm above

 diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities, including prominent
 perihilar opacities with air bronchograms.  No gross effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position.
