                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, aspiration pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 3:25 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Carina is not well visualized, but the ET tube tip
 probably lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
 tip extending beneath diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus.  A right-sided
 PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are relatively dense bilateral alveolar infiltrates with air
 bronchograms, overall unchanged in appearance.  No gross effusion.  The
 opacities obscure the cardiac silhouette, which is probably unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared with one day earlier. Differential
 diagnosis for the opacities includes multifocal pneumonic infiltrates, as well
 as other etiologies for diffuse alveolar opacities.
