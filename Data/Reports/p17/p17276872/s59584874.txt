                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation, evaluate ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Of note, two different AP portable chext views were obtained as part of this
 series, one labeled #1, the other labeled #2.  On film #1, the ET tube tip
 lies at the level of the carina, exclusively pointing towards the origin of
 the right mainstem bronchus. On film #2, which is labeled as supine, the tip
 of the ET tube is in a much more satisfactory position, lying approximately
 3.1 cm above the carina. 
 In addition, there is a followup CXR from ___ at 3:25 a.m. tha also shows
 the ETT in satisfactory position, 2.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present on the current film, tip beneath diaphragm overlying left upper
 quadrant.  
 
 A right subclavian PICC or central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No
 supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is dense alveolar opacity, right greater than left, with a perihilar
 predominance and with air bronchograms.  The appearance is compatible with
 dense pulmonary edema, though other alveolar filling processes could also
 account for this appearance.   No effusion is identified on either side.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1) ETT in satisfactory position on second CXR in this series and on follow-up
 CXR. Please see details above. 
 2) Dense alveolar  opacities, R>L, nonspecific, but most suggestive of
 pulmonary edema. No obvious pleural effusions, however.
