 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the only preceding chest radiographs, ___.
 
 Lungs are clear generally and reasonably well expanded.  However on the
 lateral view there is the suggestion of a 2.6 cm wide elliptical opacity
 projecting over the ascending thoracic aorta that could be a calcified
 atherosclerotic plaque or a subtle lung lesion.  Oblique views are recommended
 for clarification.
 
 Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is mild, probably a function of intestinal
 distention.  Heart size is top-normal.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or
 pleural abnormality.
