                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with rectus sheath hematoma, SBP, evaluate for
 fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained.  Right IJ central venous
 catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  Heart size cannot be acurately assessed
 from the AP projection.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Lung
 volumes are low. Uniform opacification of the right base with loss of right
 hemidiaphragm and right heart border likely reflects lower lobe collapse, but
 consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 Small right pleural effusions are possible. Linear atelectasis is seen within
 the left base. No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar opacification likely reflects volume loss and right lower
 lobe collapse, but consolidation cannot be excluded.
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or fluid overload.
