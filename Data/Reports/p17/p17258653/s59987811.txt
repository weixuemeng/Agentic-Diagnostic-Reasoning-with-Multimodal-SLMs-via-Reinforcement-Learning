                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lung volumes
 are slightly increased compared to the prior study with associated improved
 aeration at the right lung base and apparent slight decrease in right pleural
 effusion.  Persistent patchy and linear atelectasis at the left lung base.  No
 focal new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia. 
 Central venous catheter remains in standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased right pleural effusion and improved aeration at right
 lung base.  Residual bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
