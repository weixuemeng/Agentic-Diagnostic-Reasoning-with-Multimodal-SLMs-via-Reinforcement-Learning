                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Assault with sternal pain and pain along the left second
 through fourth ribs.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating no
 acute fracture.  Lungs appear clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable chest radiograph.  If there is strong clinical
 concern for rib fracture, a dedicated rib series may be helpful to further
 reassess.
