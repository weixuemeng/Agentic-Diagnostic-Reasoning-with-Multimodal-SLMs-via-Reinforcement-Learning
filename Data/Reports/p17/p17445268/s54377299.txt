 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ and series of older

 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates increasing
 bilateral lower lobe opacities obscuring the diaphragmatic contours.  There
 are new small bilateral pleural effusions as well.  Several other areas of
 heterogeneous opacity are seen overlying the left heart border as well as in
 the infrahilar region on the right.  There is no pneumothorax.  The hilar and

 terminates with the longer component within the left mainstem bronchus.  An
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly out of the field of
 view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral lower lobe opacities concerning for persistent
 hemorrhage or multifocal pneumonia, depending on the clinical setting.
