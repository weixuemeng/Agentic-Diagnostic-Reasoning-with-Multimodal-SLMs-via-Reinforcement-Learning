  Apical component of right hydropneumothorax is slightly decreased, now tiny.
  A small right basilar air-fluid level in the pleural space is unchanged.

  right.  Pigtail catheter in unchanged position. ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right pigtail catheter for right hydropneumothorax. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___ at 08:48.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The apical component of the hydropneumothorax has decreased and is
 now tiny.  The pleural effusion component is also decreased in size, however,
 small pockets of air-fluid levels remain.  Atelectasis in the right lower lobe
 has decreased.  There is very mild bilateral interstitial edema.  The pigtail
 catheter is again seen terminating in the right base.  The heart size is
 unchanged and the aorta is tortuous.  The mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall decrease in size of hydropneumothorax.  A tiny apical air
 collection remains and several small pockets of air-fluid levels are still
 evident.
 2.  Decreasing atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
 3.  Very mild interstitial edema has not significantly changed.
