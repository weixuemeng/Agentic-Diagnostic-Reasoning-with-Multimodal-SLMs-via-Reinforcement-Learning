 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of hemoptysis and
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.
 
 There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip is 5.8 cm above the
 carina.  There is a feeding tube with side port at the GE junction and the
 distal tip could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. 
 Heart size is within normal limits.  There is again seen increased density at
 the left retrocardiac area which may represent a developing consolidation.  No
 pneumothoraces are seen.
