                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hemoptysis, evaluate for infiltrate, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___ and
 ___ as well as CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 mediastinal and hilar contours.  Heart is top normal in size.  There are
 multifocal opacifications evident, particularly evident within the bilateral
 lung bases and right mid lung and left upper to mid lung. However, there is
 also a well-delineated 3.7-cm bilobed nodular density evident within the
 inferior aspect of the right upper lung.  A small nodule is evident within
 this location on chest CT performed ___.  Findings are concerning
 for developing malignancy.  Trace right pleural effusion identified. No
 pneumothorax present.  No fracture is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bilobed nodular density in the base of the right upper lung
 concerning for mass, less likely consideration given to hematoma. Small
 multifocal opacities bilaterally, right greater than left, may reflect
 infectious process or possibly hemorrhage.  Recommend evaluation with
 dedicated chest CT, urgency dependent on patient stability.
