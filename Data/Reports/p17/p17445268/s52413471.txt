  NGT courses through the stomach and out of view. ETT tip 5 cm above carina.
  Mild worsening of the right lower lobe opacities compared to prior studies,

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  New OG tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube and the NG tube are in unchanged position.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  There is interval progression of right lung
 opacification most likely due to increase in pleural effusions and may
 potentially be also due to interval aspiration/asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Left pleural effusion is unchanged.  No evidence of pneumothorax is present.
