 satting at ___% on RA (new) with LLL crackles  // Atelectasis vs. PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is
 associated with linear opacity, more pronounced than on the prior study most
 likely reflecting atelectasis. Similar but smaller linear atelectasis is noted
 on the left. Although there is no definitive evidence of infection it cannot
 be entirely excluded. Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present
 at least on the right
