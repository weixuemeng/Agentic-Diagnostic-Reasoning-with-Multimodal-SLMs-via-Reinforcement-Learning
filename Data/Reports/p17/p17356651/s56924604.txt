                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with peripheral T cell lymphoma, receiving
 radiation, now more short of breath  // assess for pneumonia, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures, particularly at
 the lung bases. With this in mind, minimal patchy bibasilar opacities probably
 represent atelectasis. However, repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory
 level may be helpful to exclude clinically suspected pneumonia.
