                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with asthma, atrial flutter and altered mental
 status, now with cough and leukocytosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lung volumes are significantly low, with patchy opacities in the
 right lung base which may represent either atelectasis or aspiration. 
 Retrocardiac left basal atelectasis is noted.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous right basal opacities may represent sequelae of
 aspiration or atelectasis.  Recommended followup PA and lateral chest
 radiograph for further assessment.
