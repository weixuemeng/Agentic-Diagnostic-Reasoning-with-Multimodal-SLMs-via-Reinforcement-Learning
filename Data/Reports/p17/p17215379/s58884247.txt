                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post TAVR and right sided pacemaker
 placement presenting with wound and fluid collection over infection site.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus, unchanged.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  Patient is status post TAVR.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms suggestive of COPD.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions have nearly resolved.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Severe degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine with evidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and tiny bilateral pleural effusions,
 decreased in size from the prior study.
 2. Pacing leads in unchanged positions.  Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.
