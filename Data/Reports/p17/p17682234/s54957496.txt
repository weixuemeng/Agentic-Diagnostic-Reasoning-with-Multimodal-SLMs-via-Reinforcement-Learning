                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress and hypoxia on CPAP, assess for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Pulmonary vascular
 engorgement and increased interstitial abnormalities are consistent with mild
 to moderate pulmonary edema with likely accompanied bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Left retrocardiac and right basilar opacities in this setting
 could reflect asymmetric edema or atelectasis, however an infectious process
 cannot entirely be excluded.  The heart is top-normal in size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with likely small bilateral
 effusions.  
 
 In the setting of this edema, left greater than right lower lung opacities
 could reflect asymmetric edema, atelectasis or pneumonia.  Followup 2 view
 radiograph after diuresis is recommended for better assessment.
