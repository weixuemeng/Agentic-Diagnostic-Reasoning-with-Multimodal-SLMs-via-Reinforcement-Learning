                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is
 tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Moderate pulmonary
 edema is new in the interval with a small left pleural effusion noted. The
 right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view and therefore a
 small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is
 identified. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Severe
 degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion. Probable bibasilar
 atelectasis. Right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
