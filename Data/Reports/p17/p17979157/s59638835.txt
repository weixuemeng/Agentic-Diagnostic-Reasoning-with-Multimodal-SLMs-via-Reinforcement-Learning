                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  A
 questionable area of increased opacity is observed in the right infrahilar
 region on the frontal radiograph, without a definitive correlate on the
 lateral view.  A small linear opacity in the retrocardiac region is unchanged
 since ___ and probably due to focal scarring.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific opacity in right infrahilar region, not fully
 characterized by chest radiography.  If persistent on short-term followup
 chest x-rays, consider chest CT for more complete evaluation.
