                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, liver disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Trace pleural effusion may
 be present.  There is a small rounded 4-5 mm calcific density projecting over
 the anterior right first rib which may represent a bone island or
 alternatively underlying calcified granuloma.  The aorta is slightly tortuous.
 The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  Retrocardiac density with air within
 seen on the frontal and lateral views is most consistent with a hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible trace pleural
 effusion.  Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.  Likely hiatal hernia.
