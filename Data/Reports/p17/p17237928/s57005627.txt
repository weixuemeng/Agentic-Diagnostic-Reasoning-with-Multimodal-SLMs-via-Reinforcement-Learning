                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided empyema, status post
 left VATS, intrapleural pneumolysis and decortication on ___.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  As before, there is status post
 sternotomy.  Heart size has not changed.  A previously existing left-sided
 PICC line has been removed.  No pneumothorax is present in the apical area. 
 Left-sided blunting of lateral pleural sinus and moderate elevation of
 diaphragmatic contours exists as before.  Pleural scar formations in this area
 have increased in thickness, but there is no evidence of free fluid remaining,
 or any cavitation noted.  No new pulmonary abnormalities.  The right-sided
 pleural densities remain rather unchanged and the same holds for thickening of
 the interlobar fissure in its dorsal superior extension, simulating the
 appearance of an atelectasis.  No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are
 seen and the thickening of the pleural space in the right-sided apical area is
 stable.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No major interval changes.  Observe that the next preceding
 examination was already a study four days following the empyema surgery.  All
 drainage tubes have been removed from the left hemithorax already at that
 time.
