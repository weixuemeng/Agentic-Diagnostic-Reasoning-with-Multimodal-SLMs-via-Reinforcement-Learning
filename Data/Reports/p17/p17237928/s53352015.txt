                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with Dobbhoff tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Several prior studies obtained the same day earlier.
 
 Currently, the radiographs demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube tip being in the
 stomach adjacent to the NG tube.  No substantial change in the rest of the
 imaging findings is seen.
