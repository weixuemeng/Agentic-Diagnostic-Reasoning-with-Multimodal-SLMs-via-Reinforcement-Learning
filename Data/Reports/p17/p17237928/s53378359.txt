 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with severe Heart failure, evaluate for

 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 15:58.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 9:23 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent low lung volumes with layering bilateral effusions and
 associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive lower lobe
 atelectasis.  In addition, there is mild interstitial edema.  Stable
 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. 
 No pneumothorax.  Deformity of the right third posterolateral rib, likely
 related to an old fracture.  When compared to the most recent previous study,
 the interstitial edema has developed, but the pleural effusions are stable.
