                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Alcohol withdrawal, fevers, concern for aspiration. 
 Evaluate for change.
 
 CHEST:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The PICC line has been withdrawn, but still only
 lies at the junction of the SVC and left brachiocephalic vein.  Some
 atelectasis of the right base is present, but I doubt an aspiration pneumonia.
