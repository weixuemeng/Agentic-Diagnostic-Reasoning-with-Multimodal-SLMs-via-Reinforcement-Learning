                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD, now POD#2 status post
 right hemicolectomy.  Patient now presenting with low oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, and chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Asymmetric lucency of the lung apices
 as compared to the bases is consistent with patient's known history of
 emphysema.  Lung volumes are low, likely related to recent postoperative
 state.  There are increased linear basal opacities, most likely atelectasis. 
 A trace left pleural effusion is also likely.  No pulmonary edema is
 identified.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Cardiac
 margins are obscured by bibasilar opacities.  There is a small-to-moderate
 amount of subdiaphragmatic free air consistent with patient's recent abdominal
 surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, most likely
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or large effusions.
