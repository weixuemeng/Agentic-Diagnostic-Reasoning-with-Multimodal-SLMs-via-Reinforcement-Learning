 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF // repeat for ovoid finding on CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is again noted. Unfolding of the aortic arch.  Prominence of the
 pulmonary arteries.  Mild cephalization of pulmonary blood vessels. No
 pulmonary edema.  Bilateral nipple densities are visualized. No airspace
 consolidation.  The previously noted nodular density on the lateral radiograph
 just anterior to the proximal descending thoracic aorta is no longer
 visualized and was most likely composite in nature.  Round metallic density
 seen in the upper abdomen just anterior to the spine is of indeterminate
 etiology and is seen on radiographs since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly.  Mild cephalic redistribution of pulmonary blood flow in keeping
 with mild cardiac decompensation.  No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
 
 The previously noted nodule seen on the lateral just anterior to the proximal
 descending thoracic aorta view is thought to have been projectional in nature.
