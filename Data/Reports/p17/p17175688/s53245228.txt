                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged as seen
 previously.  The aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic calcifications noted
 in the descending thoracic aorta.  Lung volumes are lower compared to the
 previous study.  Enlarged on the hila is again noted bilaterally.  Mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema is worse in the interval, with increased patchy
 bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is clearly identified.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.  A
 rounded radiopaque dense structure measuring 2 cm projects over the epigastric
 region.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse in the interval, with patchy
 bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
