                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asthma and heart failure with wheezing and fever.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Enlargement of the
 pulmonary arteries is unchanged.  Bilateral nipple shadows are noted and
 should not be mistaken for intraparenchymal masses.  A circular metallic
 object is seen projecting anterior to the spine beneath the diaphragm but is
 unchanged.
