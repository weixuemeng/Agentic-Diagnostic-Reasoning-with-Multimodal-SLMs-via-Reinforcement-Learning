 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  16 mm right upper lung nodule appears slightly
 smaller than on the comparison from ___.  Multiple additional nodules of
 varying sizes are seen, best identified in the left upper lung.  Some of these
 appear more conspicuous than on the previous examination with accompanying
 bronchiectasis compatible with history ___ ___ infection.  No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary nodules as above, smaller in the right upper lung and
