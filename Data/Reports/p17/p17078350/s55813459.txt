                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NASH cirrhosis, hepatic hydrothorax s/p
 thoracentesis.  // pleural effusion, pneumothorax

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right pleural
 effusion has decreased. The effusion is better appreciated on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph. Subsequent parenchymal opacities at the right lung
 base, associated to the pleural effusion and likely atelectatic in origin,
 show several air bronchograms.
 No new parenchymal opacities. Normal diameter of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumothorax.
