                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx r hydropneumothorax  s/p tips s/p fall
 with worsening right sided back pain  // please eval for fluid versus rib
 abnormality
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent
 of right pleural fluid.  Neither the frontal nor the lateral radiograph show
 evidence of air-fluid levels.  Given the extent of the effusion, the right
 ribs are difficult to visualize. If suspicion of a rib fracture persists, a
 dedicated rib series should be performed.
