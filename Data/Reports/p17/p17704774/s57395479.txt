 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chest tube placed to waterseal. 
 Evaluate for pneumothoraces.

 There are diffuse nodular opacities throughout both lung fields consistent
 with patient's known widespread metastatic disease.  There is again seen a
 small right apical pneumothorax.  The right-sided chest tube has been pulled
 back slightly.  The pneumothorax at the right base now appears filled with
 fluid and is compatible with a hydropneumothorax as seen on the prior CT scan
 from ___.  There is increased density at the left base as well
 which is stable.  The hardware in the lower lumbar spine is stable.  There is
 a right IJ catheter with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC, stable.
