                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with eating disorder and cough, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  As seen previously, there is a poorly defined opacity
 obscuring the right heart border which could represent pneumonia, though given
 persistence over time, possibility of a pulmonary mass lesion is a concern. 
 Aside from this, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poorly defined opacity obscuring the right heart border in the
 right middle lobe region.  Given persistence over time, a CT is recommended to
 further assess.
