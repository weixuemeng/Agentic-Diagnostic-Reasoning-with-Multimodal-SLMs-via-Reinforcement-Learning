                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of gastric bypass surgery, now
 transferred from outside hospital with pneumomediastinum on CT abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ and chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Increased lucency along the right heart border
 corresponds with minimal pneumomediastinum seen on recent CT abdomen.  No
 apical pneumothorax is evident.  There is no free air below the diaphragm. 
 The lungs are clear.  There is no focal consolidation.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion or overt edema is identified.  There is new mild blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle consistent with a developing small pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Minmial pneumomediastinum
 2.  Developing new left pleural effusion
 
 Both the pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion could be further assessed on
 follow-up PA and lateral chest x-ray if clinically indicated.
