                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST: ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with AFib, pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  There are
 bibasilar opacities which partially silhouette the hemidiaphragms bilaterally
 raising possibilty of effusions and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted at the arch.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes.  However, given this limitation, there are
 still findings suggestive of failure with effusions and interstitial edema.
