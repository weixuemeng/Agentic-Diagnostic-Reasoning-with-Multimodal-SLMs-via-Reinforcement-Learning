 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p whipple  // Pls confirm NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of nasogastric tube terminates at the proximal stomach. 
 There are low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar opacities may in part relate
 to low lung volumes which may be seen in setting of pulmonary vascular
 engorgement/ edema.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 large pleural effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube terminates in the expected location of the proximal stomach.  Low
 lung volumes.  Bilateral hilar prominence could relate to fluid overload and
 low lung volumes.
