                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Palpitations and atrial fibrillation. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded. The bilateral hila are prominent, likely
 due to fullness of the vascular structures and mild congestion. There is
 minimal left basilar atelectasis. No consolidation is identified to suggest
 pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mildly hyperexpanded lungs and vascular congestion. No evidence of pneumonia.
