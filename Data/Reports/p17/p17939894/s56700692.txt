                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD with acute onset shortness of breath 
 // please evaluate for pulmonary edema vs findings consistent with COPD     
 please evaluate for pulmonary edema vs findings consistent w
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperinflation of the
 lungs consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD.  The cardiac silhouette
 is unchanged.  There is increased prominence of engorged pulmonary
 interstitial markings, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Retrocardiac opacification again suggests volume loss in the lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be
 difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the
 absence of a lateral view.
