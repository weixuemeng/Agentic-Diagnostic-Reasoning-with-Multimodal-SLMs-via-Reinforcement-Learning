                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, hip pain*** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // r/o fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain mildly hyperexpanded.  Left lower lobe, retrocardiac streaky
 peribronchial opacities are not well evaluated on this portable radiograph. 
 Mild obscuration of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a trace
 pleural effusion.  There is no lobar consolidation or large pneumothorax
 identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from the prior
 examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nonspecific left retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelectasis,
 aspiration, or an early focus of pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs
 may be helpful in this regard.
