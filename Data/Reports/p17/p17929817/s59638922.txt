                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged with a somewhat globular
 configuration.  This likely reflects known pericardial effusion.  Left
 retrocardiac region is not optimally evaluated in the setting of enlarged
 cardiac silhouette and superimposed soft tissues of the chest wall, but no
 definite areas of consolidation are present in this region.  Considering
 clinical history of left lower lobe opacity on outside chest radiographs,
 dedicated PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete
 evaluation of the left lower lobe when the patient's condition permits.
