                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man recently treated for pneumonia at another hospital,
 still coughing with a low-grade fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Consolidation, predominantly in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe,
 to a lesser degree in the posterior segment, developed between ___
 and ___.  It has improved subsequently, but not cleared.  If symptoms
 persist, I would recommend repeat chest radiographs in no more than two weeks
 and if these are still abnormal, CT scanning would be indicated at that time
 to exclude bronchial obstruction.  Left lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is
 normal and there is no pleural effusion.  There are no changes in the contours
 of the mediastinum or right hilus since ___ to indicate central lymph node
 enlargement, but adenopathy could be present and not appreciated.
