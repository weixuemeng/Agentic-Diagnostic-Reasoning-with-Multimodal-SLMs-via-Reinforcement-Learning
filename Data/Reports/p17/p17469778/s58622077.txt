                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated status post arrest with worsening hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  A persistent,
 moderate left pleural effusion appears slightly increased from prior exam
 although this may be due to positional effect.  Persistent low lung volumes
 and left greater than right atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Lungs are otherwise without focal consolidation or evidence of
 edema.  The endotracheal tube appears to have been slightly withdrawn with the
 tip terminating 7 cm cranial to the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent moderate left pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis and low lung
 volumes.  
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina.  Recommend advancement of
 the ET tube by 2-3 cm.
