                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single supine chest radiograph was obtained.  An endotracheal tube
 terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC.  An enteric catheter terminates in the body of
 the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  A left
 pleural effusion obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal, however the left cardiac border is particularly sharp.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Appropriate position of lines and tubes.
 
 2.  Small left pleural effusion. 
 
 3.  Sharp left heart border may be a sign of pneumothorax on a supine film.
 
 4.  A semi-upright (or upright) radiograph will be helpful to further evaluate
 for left lower lobe collapse, possible left pneumothorax, and assess fluid
 volume.  
 
 The final impression was discussed with Dr ___ ___ phone at ___ on ___.
