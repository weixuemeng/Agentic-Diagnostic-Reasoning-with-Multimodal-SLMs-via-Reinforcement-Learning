                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible new left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, there is the vague suggestion of some increased opacification
 in the left lower lung areas.  This could merely reflect some prominence of
 interstitial markings bilaterally that could reflect some chronic pulmonary
 disease.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
