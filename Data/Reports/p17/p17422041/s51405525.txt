 INDICATION:  Upper respiratory infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed.  Compared to the
 most recent prior study of ___, minimal increase in radiographic
 denisty and subtle loss of vessel contours in the left lower lob could
 represent developing pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal and
 calcification of the aortic knob is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in radiographic denisty and subtle loss of
 vessel contours in the left lower lobe could represent developing pneumonia
 which should be confirmed on short term radiographic follow-up.
