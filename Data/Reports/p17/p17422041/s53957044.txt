                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope and fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Minimally increased bronchvascular opacity at the
 right base could represent vascular crowding though a small aspiration or
 developing infection would be difficult to entirely exclude.  No pneumothorax
 or significant pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged with calcifications of the aortic arch and normal cardiac size.
