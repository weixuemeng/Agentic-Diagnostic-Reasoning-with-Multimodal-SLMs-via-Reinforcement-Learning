                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of influenza-like illness with cough, sore
 throat, congestion, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Overall, there has been no significant interval change.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Aortic
 knob calcification is again seen.  Slight linear increase in opacity at the
 right lung base may be due to overlapping structures or chronic changes,
 similar to prior.
