                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Increased opacity at the left lung
 base likely atelectasis, though, early pneumonia could be considered in the
 correct clinical setting.  Blunting of right costophrenic angle is unchanged
 over multiple prior studies and consistent with scarring as seen on the prior
 chest CTA.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Mediastinal and hilar structures are
 unremarkable.
