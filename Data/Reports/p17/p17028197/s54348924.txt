                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and asthma exacerbation, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again, there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  However, no
 evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
