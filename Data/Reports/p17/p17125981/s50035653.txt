                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 7:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest tube removal, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 13:29.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 8:35 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of the left chest tube and right internal jugular
 introducer catheter.  The left subclavian PICC line remains in place with its
 tip in the mid-to-distal SVC.  Status post median sternotomy for CABG with
 overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given patient rotation on this
 study.  There is possibly a tiny left apical pneumothorax; however, this does
 not appear to be significantly changed from the prior study from ___. 
 There is likely a layering right effusion and the vasculature appears somewhat
 more ill-defined, which likely reflects an element of mild interstitial and
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity at the left base is again seen, and may
 reflect atelectasis, though an early infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Followup imaging would be advised.
