                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is similar to the prior study.  Bilateral lower lobe areas of
 consolidation are again demonstrated and may reflect pulmonary edema with or
 without accompanying pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are unchanged.
