 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  Bibasilar
 consolidations and small pleural effusions are not significantly changed since
 prior.  Perihilar vascular congestion is again noted.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Aortic arch calcifications are present.  The heart size is
 normal.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent bibasilar consolidations with small pleural effusions, most
 compatible with infection.
