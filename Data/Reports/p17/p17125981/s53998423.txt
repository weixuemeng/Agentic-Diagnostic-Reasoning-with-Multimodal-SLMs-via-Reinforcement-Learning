                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with pneumonia and replaced OG tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP portable chest x-ray earlier the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  New OG tube enters the stomach and out of field of view.  ET tube
 tip is 1.5 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 3 cm for more optimal
 placement.  Right IJ catheter ends in the low SVC.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, are increased. Pulmonary edema is
 essentially the same.  Lung volumes and cardiomediastinal silhouette are
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) OG tube passes into the stomach.  ET tube tip 1.5 cm from the carina;
 withdraw 3 cm for more optimal placement. 
 2) Unchanged pulmonary edema with increased bilateral pleural effusions.
 3) Pneumonia. Presumed right lung consolidations now obscured.
