                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxia and altered mental status.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes.  Heterogeneous
 patchy opacity in the right lung base is new since prior exam.  There is also
 a new vague retrocardiac opacity.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild vascular congestion is noted.  The hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise unremarkable.  Aortic arch
 calcifications are again noted.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung base opacity, compatible with pneumonia, in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Findings also suggestive of mild vascular congestion.
