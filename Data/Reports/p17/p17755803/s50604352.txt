                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  DOE, cough, recent bronchitis, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 consolidation and volume loss at the left lung base which could represent
 atelectasis though given history a small component of pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  The right lung appears clear.  Heart size appears normal. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable atelectasis accounting for opacity at the left lung base
 though an early/mild component of pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
