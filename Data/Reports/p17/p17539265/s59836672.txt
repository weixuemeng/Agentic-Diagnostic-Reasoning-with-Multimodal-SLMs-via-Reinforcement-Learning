                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, status post cardiac arrest, evaluate
 for ETT placement and orogastric tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea
 5 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax is identified.  An NG
 tube reaches well below the diaphragm.  Heart size is difficult to assess as
 patient is in supine position, but gross cardiac enlargement cannot be
 identified.  Aorta is poorly identified on this portable chest examination. 
 There is marked pulmonary congestive pattern with bilateral extensive
 densities in practically all lung areas.  As the periphery is relatively free,
 the present finding is most likely representing acute pulmonary edema. 
 Possibility of superimposed scattered aspirations cannot be excluded. 
 Remarkable is the absence of any pleural effusion on the lung bases as the
 lateral pleural sinuses are free.  Our records include only an old portable
 chest examination dated ___.  The lungs were clear at that time, and no gross
 abnormality was seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ETT and NG tube in correct positions.  No pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral advanced pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates, most likely representing
 edema.  Patient underwent CT examination with angiography at the same date.
