                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with multifocal pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 ET tube is in the standard position.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip is the right
 lower lobe segment should be withdrawal 4 cm for more standard position. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, partially
 obscured by lung abnormalities.  Asymmetric right greater than left multifocal
 consolidations consistent with multifocal pneumonia are grossly unchanged. 
 Improved aeration of the lower lobes and left upper lobe is due to improving
 atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions have probably unchanged allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient.  NG tube tip is out of view below
 the diaphragm.
 
 Position of SG catheter was discussed with ___ by phone, ___ at
