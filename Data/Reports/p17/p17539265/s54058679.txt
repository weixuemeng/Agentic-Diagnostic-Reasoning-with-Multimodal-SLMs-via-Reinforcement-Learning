 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with status post arrest with bilateral

 orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach, appropriate in
 position. Over last 24 hours, bilateral, confluent pulmonary opacities have
 asymmetrically improved, predominantly in the left upper lung.  The extent of
 opacities in the left lower lung is unchanged.  Possibilities incluide
 pulmonary edema or aspiration or combination.  Persistent opacities could be
 either a residual edema or aspiration.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 similar.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
