                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with decreased ostomy output,
 hypotension, question free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  Curvilinear calcification projecting over
 the heart likely represents mitral annular calcification.  The aorta is
 somewhat unfolded.  The lungs appear clear.  Subtle opacity projecting over
 the right mid lung at the site of rib overlap likely reflects summation of
 shadows.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with evidence of mitral annular calcification. 
 Subtle nodularity in the right mid lung likely reflects summation of shadows
 though oblique projections may be obtained to clarify.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.
