                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia with pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists with some
 atelectatic changes at the bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
