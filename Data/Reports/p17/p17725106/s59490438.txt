 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, chronic heart failure, exacerbation,
 evaluation for pleural effusions.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows unchanged
 signs of moderate pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.  Areas
 of atelectasis are also seen.  The size of the cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  The left costophrenic sinus is unremarkable.  No evidence of
 interval appearance of parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
