                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with worsening dyspnea no ___% on 4 L of O2 nasal
 cannula.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  When compared to prior, there is new right
 basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm likely due to at least some
 component of pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascular congestion appears grossly
 similar compared to prior.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not definitely
 enlarged since prior noting slight limitation from rotation to the right. 
 Lower thoracic and upper lumbar dextroscoliosis are noted.  Old healed
 posterior left rib fracture again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 Right basilar opacity suggestive of effusion with possible associated
 atelectasis or infection.
