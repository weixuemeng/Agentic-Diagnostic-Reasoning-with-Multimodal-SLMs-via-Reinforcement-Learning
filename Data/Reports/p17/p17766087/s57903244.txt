                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intoxication and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Streaky opacities at lung bases could reflect atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities undo present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes which limits assessment of the lung bases.  Streaky opacities
 at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.
