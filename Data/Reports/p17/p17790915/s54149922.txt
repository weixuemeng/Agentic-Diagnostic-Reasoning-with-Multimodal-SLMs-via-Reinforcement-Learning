                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 17:54
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post subclavian central line removal,
 now with chest pain.  Question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 4:48.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 17:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of right subclavian central line with no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  The feeding tube remains coiled within the expected location of
 the stomach.  There is persistent patchy opacity at the right base with an
 associated effusion likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  There is likely a smaller
 left effusion with some streaky linear opacities at the left base likely
 reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 Right fourth and fifth posterior old rib fractures with no acute bony
 abnormality appreciated.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
