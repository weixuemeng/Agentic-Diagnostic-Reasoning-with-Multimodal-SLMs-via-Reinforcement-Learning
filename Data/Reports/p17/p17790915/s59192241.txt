                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:48 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Dobbhoff tube placement attempt.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2:32 a.m.:
 
 Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place passes beyond the upper stomach and
 out of view.  A large right pleural effusion may have increased in the
 interim.  Heart size top normal.  Mediastinal veins are dilated, due in part
 to non-erect positioning, but suggestive of volume overload, since pulmonary
 vessels are also distended.
