                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dropping hematocrit.  Evaluate for hemothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.  CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: An endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  A valve
 prosthesis, right internal jugular catheter, enteric tube, sternal hardware
 and axillary clips are unchanged.  A left internal jugular catheter is seen
 within the upper SVC with the tip directed toward the lateral wall.  A right
 pigtail chest tube is directed superiorly. 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is again accompanied by severe diffuse pulmonary edema. 
 Further obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border indicates
 slight worsening.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary edema, overall worse than prior.
