                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Worsening oxygenation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is
 in the stomach.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the right main pulmonary
 artery, appears to be different in location as compared to the prior study. 
 The replaced mitral valve is unchanged in appearance as well as the sternal
 wire projecting over the mediastinum.  There is substantial interval
 improvement of the right lung opacities, but worsening of the left lung
 opacities that might reflect slightly different distribution of pulmonary
 edema.  No interval increase in pleural effusion is suspected and no
 pneumothorax can be seen on the current examination.
