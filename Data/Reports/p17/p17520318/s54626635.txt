                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent coronary artery bypass surgery
 and cardiac valvular surgery.  Allowing for rightward patient rotation,
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Indwelling support and
 monitoring devices are unchanged in position, including a left internal
 jugular vascular catheter with tip directed towards the lateral wall of the
 superior vena cava.  Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion and persistent diffuse pulmonary edema, affecting the right lung to
 a greater degree than the left.  Coexisting pneumonia is also possible in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions
 are also noted.
