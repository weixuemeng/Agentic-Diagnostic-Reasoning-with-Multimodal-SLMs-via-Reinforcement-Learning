                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // eval PTX, infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright portable view of the chest is obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs:  ___.
 Chest CT:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are perihilar airspace opacities bilaterally, with more confluent
 consolidation in the right mid lung.  Peribronchial cuffing is noted
 bilaterally, along with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged, similar compared to prior studies.  There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax.  There is likely a pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings are compatible with pulmonary edema.  Denser consolidation in the
 right midlung is potentially asymmetric edema, however this finding remains
 concerning for superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
