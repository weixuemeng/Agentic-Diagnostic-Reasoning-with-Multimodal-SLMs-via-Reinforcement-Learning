                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is top-normal in size.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Bilateral air space opacities are significantly
 increased from the study done in ___ and suggest pulmonary edema, right
 greater than left.  Evaluation is somewhat limited due to extensive bilateral
 airspace opacities however there may be possible small cavitary lesions
 involving the right lung.  Underlying infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left suggest moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema.  Underlying infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Possible small cavitary lesions involving the
 right upper lobe.  Consider CT for further evaluation when clinically
 appropriate.
