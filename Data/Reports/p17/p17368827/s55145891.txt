                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Viral symptoms, rhonchi at the right base.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal streaky right basilar opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis, though developing infection cannot be completely
 excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The left lung is
 clear.  No acute osseous abnormalities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal streaky right basilar opacity is likely reflective of atelectasis. 
 Infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.
