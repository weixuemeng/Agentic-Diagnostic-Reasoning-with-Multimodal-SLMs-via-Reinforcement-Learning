                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum may be due to vascular structures and mediastinal fat. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacity within the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No
 pneumomediastinum is demonstrated.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite evidence for pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax. Widening of the mediastinum superiorly likely reflects
 underlying vascular structures and mediastinal fat.  If there is continued
 concern, chest CT can be obtained for further assessment.
