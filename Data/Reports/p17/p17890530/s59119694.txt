                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.  Question congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  A trace pleural effusion on the right
 is difficult to exclude, noting similar posterior blunting of the costophrenic
 sulcus.  There is again upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature,
 mild interstitial abnormality, and an indistinct appearance of pulmonary
 vasculature, most consistent of mild pulmonary edema, but unchanged.  There is
 no focal opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar cardiomegaly and findings consistent with mild pulmonary
 edema.
