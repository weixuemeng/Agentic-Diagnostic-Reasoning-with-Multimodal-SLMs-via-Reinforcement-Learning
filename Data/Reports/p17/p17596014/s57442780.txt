                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Amiodarone therapy, to assess for TB.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no change or evidence
 of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits
 of normal in size in a patient who has undergone previous CABG procedure.  No
 acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 Specifically, no evidence of old tuberculous disease or interstitial
 prominence to suggest amiodarone toxicity.
