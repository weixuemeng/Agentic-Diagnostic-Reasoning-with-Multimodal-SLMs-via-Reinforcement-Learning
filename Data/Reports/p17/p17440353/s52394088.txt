                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  I have reviewed prior chest radiographs specifically to comment on
 the overall progression of lingular consolidation since it onest appeared on
 ___.
 
 On ___ the abnormality has the typical appearance of uncomplicated
 lingular pneumonia.  On ___ the area of involvement in the lingula was
 smaller, including a region of coalescence, probably atelectasis.  On ___, the overall area of involvement in the lingula had not changed, but some
 of this was due to new atelectasis in the inferior subsegment seen on the
 lateral view along the major fissure.  There was no appreciable change in this
 appearance between ___ and ___.  The only difference between
 those two radiographs was better inspiration on ___.
 
 The most likely explanation for this series of radiographic changes is a
 routine pneumonia, incompletely treated, that still includes some
 consolidation and some atelectasis.  There is no reason to invoke a
 complication, such as an endobronchial lesion, but it would be prudent to
 document substantial resolution.  If the patient continues to improve
 clinically, it would not be productive to repeat chest radiographs sooner than
 one month from now.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia poorly responsive to antibiotics. 
 Evaluate for interval improvement of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lingular opacity is not significantly changed since the prior study.  There is
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent lingular opacity which could represent atelectasis or incompletely
 treated pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Continued imaging to complete resolution is recommended.
