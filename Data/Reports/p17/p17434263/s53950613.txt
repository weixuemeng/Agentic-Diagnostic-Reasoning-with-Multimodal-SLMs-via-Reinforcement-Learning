                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with subclavian line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:47 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 A single portable frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 8 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 tube is in the stomach.  The right subclavian central venous catheter is
 directed into the right internal jugular vein and needs to be repositioned. 
 Confluent airspace opacities are present in bilateral mid to lower lungs,
 likely representing aspiration or pneumonia, unchanged.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned right subclavian line directed into the right internal
 jugular vein.
 2.  The endotracheal tube is high, given that the patient's head is up,
 consider advancing by at most 2 cm for optimal placement.
 3.  Unchanged dense bilateral mid-lower lung opacities, most consistent with
 aspiration or pneumonia.
