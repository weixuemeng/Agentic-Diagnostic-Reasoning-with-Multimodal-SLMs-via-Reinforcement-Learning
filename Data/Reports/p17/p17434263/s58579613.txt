                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated transfer, evaluate ET tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are bilateral mid to lower lung opacities which may reflect aspiration,
 infection or hemorrhage.  The lungs appear hyperinflated which may reflect
 emphysema, and bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouette are unremarkable.  A NG tube is seen terminating within
 the proximal stomach, and the side port appears to be at the GE junction.  The
 ET tube is in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral mid to lower lung opacities could reflect infection, aspiration
 or hemorrhage.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  NG tube terminates within the proximal stomach, and the side port appears
 approximately at the level of the GE junction.  Recommend advancement so that
 it is well within the stomach.
