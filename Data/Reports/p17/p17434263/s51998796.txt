                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with sepsis, new left IJ line.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 22:14.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP supine radiograph of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube remains 8 cm above the carina.  Malpositioned right
 subclavian line has been removed and a left internal jugular catheter is now
 seen with the tip in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contour is stable.  Dense
 airspace opacities in the mid to lower lung zones bilaterally are largely
 unchanged and consistent with pneumonia.  Small bilateral effusions are
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of malpositioned right subclavian catheter and insertion
 of new left IJ catheter with the tip in the mid SVC.  
 2.  The endotracheal tube remains high, given that the patient's head is up,
 consider advancing by at most 2 cm for optimal placement.
 3.  Unchanged dense bilateral mid-lower lung opacities, most consistent with
 aspiration or pneumonia.
