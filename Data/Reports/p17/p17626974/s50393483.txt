                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, fevers, vomiting, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Given this, there may be mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary process.
