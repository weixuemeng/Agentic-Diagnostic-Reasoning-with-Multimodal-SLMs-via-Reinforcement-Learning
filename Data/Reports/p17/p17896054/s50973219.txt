  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  
  Asymmetric opacity projecting over left first costochondral junction.  This
  could entirely be degenerative however given possible correlative finding on
  the lateral view projecting over the lungs, apical lordotic view is suggested
  to further localize finding to the osseous structures or underlying lung.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest pain  // eval for structural process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is
 asymmetric opacity projecting over the left first costochondral junction with
 respect to the right.  On the lateral view, there is also increased opacity
 projecting over the anterior superior endplate of an upper thoracic vertebral
 body which could correlate with a finding on the frontal view. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Asymmetric opacity projecting over left first costochondral junction.  This
 could entirely be degenerative however given possible correlative finding on
 the lateral view projecting over the lungs, apical lordotic view is suggested
 to further localize finding to the osseous structures or underlying lung.
 
 RECOMMMENDATIONS:  Apical lordotic view is suggested to further localize
 finding to the osseous structures or underlying lung.
