                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and congestion.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable, taking into account moderate rightward
 convex curvature of the thoracic spine.  There is patchy opacification in the
 left lower lung, particularly in the right middle lobe, and to a lesser degree
 more posteriorly, in the right lower lobe where streaky opacities are seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mildly exaggerated
 kyphotic curvature and slight degenerative change noted along the visualized
 upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right basilar opacities, which are typical of
 atelectasis; it is difficult to entirely exclude pneumonia, however, in the
 appropriate setting.
