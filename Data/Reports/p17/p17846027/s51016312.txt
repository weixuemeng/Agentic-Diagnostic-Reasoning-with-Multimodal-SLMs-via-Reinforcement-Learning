                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath x2 days with history of asthma, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is at the upper limits of normal, unchanged from
 prior.  The mediastinum is normal in appearance.  There is atelectasis seen at
 the right base.  Flattened diaphragms and increased AP diameter are consistent
 with increased lung volumes.  There is an exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic
 spine with mild degenerative changes again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
