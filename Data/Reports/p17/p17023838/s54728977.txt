                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased and the extent of the bilateral pleural effusions has substantially
 decreased.  However, signs of effusion are still seen bilaterally, notably on
 the right.  Both hilar structures are at the upper range of normal in
 diameter.  There is a minimal increase in right upper mediastinal density,
 potentially caused by patient's rotation.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
