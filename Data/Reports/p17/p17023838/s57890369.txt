                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Worsening lower extremity edema bilateral rales. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:   ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with diffuse calcification
 of the thoracic aorta and prominence of both hila.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.  Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.  Loss of height of a vertebral
 body at the thoracolumbar junction is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
