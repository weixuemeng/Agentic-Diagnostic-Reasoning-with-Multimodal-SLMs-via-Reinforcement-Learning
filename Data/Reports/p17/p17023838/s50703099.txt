 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with lower extremity gangrene and

 FINDINGS:  No prior studies for comparison.
 
 Heart size is upper limits of normal.  There are low lung volumes due to poor
 inspiratory effort.  There are prominent bronchovascular markings suggestive
 of pulmonary edema as well as more confluent opacities within the right
 mid-to-lower lung fields.  There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
