                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with bilateral lower
 extremity dry gangrene with increased white blood cell count.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 As compared to ___, there is interval development of right lower
 lobe opacity, which is most likely a combination of pleural effusion and
 consolidation that potentially may be atelectasis versus infectious process. 
 Left retrocardiac consolidation has increased as well as associated with
 increased left pleural effusion.  Overall in the constellation of the
 described clinical findings, the findings are concerning for bilateral
 pneumonia.
