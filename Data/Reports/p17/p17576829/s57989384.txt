                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bicycle accident, rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference made to outside hospital chest radiograph performed
 earlier today, ___ at 12:47 as well as to CT performed at outside
 institution today, ___ at 16:24.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Subtle left basilar opacity likely corresponds to atelectasis/possible
 pulmonary contusion as seen on CT earlier today.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There are no findings to suggest pneumothorax.  There are multiple
 left-sided rib fractures, better assessed on CT, however, 1 reasonably well
 seen involves the posterior left 4th rib is, which is minimally displaced. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures, better assessed on CT.  Subtle possibly
 left lung base opacity likely relates to atelectasis/pulmonary contusion as
 seen on CT.
