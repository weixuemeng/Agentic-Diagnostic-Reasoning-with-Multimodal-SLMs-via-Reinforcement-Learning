                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever for 2 days, pancreatic cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the low SVC.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small left pleural effusion is noted, with
 streaky bibasilar airspace opacities which appear slightly progressed compared
 to the prior exam.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel degenerative
 changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Clips are seen within the midline
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, slightly progressed in the interval,
 could reflect atelectasis or infection with a trace left pleural effusion.
