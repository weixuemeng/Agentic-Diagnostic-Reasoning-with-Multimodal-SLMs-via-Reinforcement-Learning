                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough for the past week.  Evaluate for acute cardiac
 or pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Lung
 volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and
 accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is minimal bilateral lower
 lung atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The heart size is normal. 
 The mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  A round calcific density adjacent to the superior
 aspect of the right humeral head could represent calcific tendinitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Calcific density adjacent to the right humeral head, possibly representing
 calcific tendinitis.  Clinical correlation recommended.
