                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___. As seen on previous examinations, the patient is known to have a chest
 deformity with marked kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine and increased
 depth diameter.  On the frontal view, diaphragms are in relatively high
 position obscuring major portions of the heart shadow.  Significant
 cardiomegaly, however, is unlikely as there is no evidence of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated but
 does not demonstrate any local contour abnormalities or walled calcifications.
 The accentuated kyphosis is again well demonstrated on the lateral view which
 also demonstrates that the posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid
 accumulation.  There is no evidence of any acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrate, and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area on the
 frontal view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of previously identified chest deformity, no
 conclusive evidence for cardiac enlargement, no signs of pulmonary congestion
 and no acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in this ___-year-old female
 patient with history of cough.
