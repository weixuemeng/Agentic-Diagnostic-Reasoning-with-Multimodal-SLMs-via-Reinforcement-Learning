                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with crackles.  Evaluate for pleural
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting position using
 AP frontal and left lateral views.  Relatively high positioned diaphragms
 obscure major portion of the heart shadow but significant cardiac enlargement
 is unlikely.  The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated but no
 local contour abnormalities are identified.  Some calcium deposits are seen in
 the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No evidence of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Comparison is
 made with the next preceding chest examination, which is represented by a
 transferred chest examination of ___ with patient in supine position
 and identified as ___.  The findings on this frontal
 view are similar to what is found on today's examination and thus there is no
 evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions in this
 apparently incapacitated patient.
