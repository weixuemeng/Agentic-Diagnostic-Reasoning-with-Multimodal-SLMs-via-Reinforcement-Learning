 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings. Right greater than left basilar opacities may be
 secondary to atelectasis. There is no large effusion. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Right greater than left basilar opacities potentially due to
 atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded.
