 postop hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post open reduction internal fixation of the left
 humeral head.  The study is not tailored to assess the fixation.
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes with patchy airspace opacities bilaterally,
 predominantly involving the right lung and may reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.  Unchanged left apical pleural parenchymal thickening.  No pneumothorax
 identified.  The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but may
 be secondary to low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with diffuse bilateral patchy airspace opacities
 predominantly involving the right lung which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.
