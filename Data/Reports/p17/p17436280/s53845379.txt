                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bradycardia and increased fatigue.  Rule out
 acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exams from ___ and ___.  Compared to priors, there has been no
 significant interval change.  Again seen are relatively low lung volumes,
 particularly on the frontal exam.  Coarse interstitial markings are seen at
 the bases and at the peripheries of the upper lungs, right greater than left. 
 These are most suggestive of chronic underlying lung disease.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or new consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  Dual-lead pacing device again seen with lead tips in stable
 positions.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of chronic lung disease without definite superimposed
 consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion.
