                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ leukocytosis please eval for pna  // ___F w/ leukocytosis
 please eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate cardiomegaly with bilateral
 opacities and central vascular engorgement to suggest pulmonary edema. 
 Obscuration of the bilateral costophrenic angles reflects pleural effusions,
 small to moderate.  Increased retrocardiac opacity on the right WITH VOLUME
 LOSS COULD BE DUE TO ATELECTASIS ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH PNEUMONIA. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  LEFT TRANS SUBCLAVIAN RIGHT ATRIAL RIGHT
 VENTRICULAR PACER LEADS ARE CONTINUOUS FROM THE LEFT PECTORAL GENERATOR.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with evidence to suggest pulmonary edema. SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL
 EFFUSIONS.
 POSSIBLE RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA.
