                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, assess for abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 chest examination of ___.  Heart size is normal.  Relatively
 wide mediastinal and cardiac contours are compatible with previously on CT
 documented mediastinal lipomatosis.  Accessible aortic contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.  In comparison with the next preceding study, no significant
 interval change can be identified.  Prominence of soft tissue structures
 surrounding the skeletal structures of the thorax are indicative of rather
 advanced adiposity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of pulmonary congestion or
 acute parenchymal infiltrates in this patient with history of cough.
