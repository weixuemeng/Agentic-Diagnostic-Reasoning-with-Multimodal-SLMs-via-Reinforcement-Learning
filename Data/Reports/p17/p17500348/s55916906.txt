  Small left retroperitoneal hematoma likely arising from the left psoas muscle.
  No active extravasation seen but this study was not performed in the arterial
  phase. A small hyperdense focus at the inferior aspect of the collection may
  be the source of bleeding. If there is a clinical concern for active arterial
  bleeding an arterial phase study could be obtained.
