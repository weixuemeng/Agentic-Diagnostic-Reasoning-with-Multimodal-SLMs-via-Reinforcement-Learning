                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with COPD exacerbation.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position with
 dual electrode intracavitary system unchanged.  Mild cardiac enlargement as
 before.  No acute pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or infiltrates are seen.  Mild degree of prominent breast shadows
 suggestive of gynecomastia.  The comparison is extended to the next previous
 chest examination of ___.  Again, no significant interval change
 can be identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Permanent pacer, mild cardiac enlargement, no conclusive evidence
 for significant pulmonary congestion.  Some irregular distribution of
 pulmonary vasculature consistent with COPD but again acute infiltrates
 indicating exacerbating infection are not seen.
