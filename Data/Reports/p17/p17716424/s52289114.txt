                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia versus congestive
 heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. Chest CT from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  There is re-demonstration of a left-sided pacemaker with associated
 right atrial and right ventricular leads.  A linear opacity at the left lung
 base is not significantly changed, likely scarring.  There is minimal
 bibasilar lower lung atelectasis.  Upper lung predominant emphysema was better
 seen on prior chest CT from ___.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is top normal.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No focal consolidation or evidence of congestive heart failure.
 
 2.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Emphysema.
