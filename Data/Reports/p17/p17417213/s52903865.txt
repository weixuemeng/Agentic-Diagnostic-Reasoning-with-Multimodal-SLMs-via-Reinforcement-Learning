 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided vagus nerve stimulator is noted.  Lungs are hyperinflated,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is diffuse mild
 increased interstitial markings bilaterally which may relate to chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease or other chronic lung disease with possible
 minimal interstitial edema superimposed.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs with mild prominence of the interstitium suggests chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Minimal superimposed interstitial edema could
 be present.  No focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
