                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Smoking history with persistent cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again atelectatic
 or fibrotic change at the left base.  However, no definite acute focal
 pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  
 
 Continued hyperexpansion of the lung with flattening of the hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with the clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.
