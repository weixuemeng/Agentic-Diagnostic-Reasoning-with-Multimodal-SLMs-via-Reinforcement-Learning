 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Persistent and increasing cough, rule out infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are slightly larger than normal, with slightly
 flattened diaphragms, suggesting moderate overinflation.  Subtle
 irregularities at the left lateral rib margins might indicate healed rib
 fractures.
 
 There is mild hyperlucency at the lung apices, potentially suggestive of
 pulmonary emphysema.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No acute infection.  No pulmonary edema.  The size of
 the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable, there is minimal tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  Otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 No evidence of lung nodules or masses.
