                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large right pleural effusion has increased in size and is
 associated with atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma, predominantly in
 the right middle and right lower lobes with a lesser degree of atelectasis in
 the right upper lobe.  Perihepatic drain remains in place adjacent to an
 elevated right hemidiaphragm, and a second catheter is present, reportedly
 placed on ___ for drainage of an intrahepatic fluid collection. 
 The enlarging pleural effusion has displaced the cardiomediastinal contours
 towards the left, limiting assessment of the heart size.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is present, and note is also made of worsening left
 retrocardiac opacity, probably due to atelectasis, although aspiration and
 developing pneumonia could have a similar radiographic appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increasing, large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
 
 2.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis.
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
