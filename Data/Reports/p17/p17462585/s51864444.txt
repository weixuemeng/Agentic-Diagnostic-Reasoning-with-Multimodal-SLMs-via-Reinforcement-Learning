                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, dementia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present as result of low lung volumes, but mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.  Multiple compression
 deformities in the thoracolumbar junction are re- demonstrated.  Degenerative
 changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted with a high riding left
 humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal
 consolidation.
