                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  Hazy central opacities including fullness
 of central pulmonary vessels is consistent with mild pulmonary edema although
 not as severe as on prior presentation.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The left humeral head appears attenuated on a chronic basis.
 There is a new mild lower thoracic compression fracture since the prior study,
 although not necessarily acute, as well as a more inferior thoracolumbar
 compression deformity of moderate severity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings most consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  New mild lower thoracic
 compression fracture, although not necessarily acute.
