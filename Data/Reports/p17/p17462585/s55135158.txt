                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours appear
 unchanged.  There is a new small-to-moderate pleural effusion on the left.  A
 small pleural effusion is also suspected on the right.  Patchy opacities at
 the lung bases suggest minor atelectasis associated with pleural effusions.
 Perihilar fullness and interstitial abnormality and indistinct pulmonary
 vasculature suggest moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Left
 pleural effusion and probably also a small one on the right.
