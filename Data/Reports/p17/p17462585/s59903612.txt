                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute onset chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are diffuse bilateral opacities and haziness and
 indistinctness of the hila, most likely due to moderate-to-severe pulmonary
 edema.    The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  No large pleural effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral perihilar opacities, most likely due to pulmonary
 edema; however, component of infection is difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Followup after diuresis can be obtained for
 further evaluation.
