 HISTORY:  Worsening lung function.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a somewhat better inspiration.  There is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacifications
 consistent with atelectasis and possible small pleural effusions.
