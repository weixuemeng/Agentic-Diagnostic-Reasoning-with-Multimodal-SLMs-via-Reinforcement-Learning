                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with previous right pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the suggested area of
 opacification in the right mid zone is no longer present.  There is no
 evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.  Prominence
 of the ascending aorta raises the possibility of underlying hypertension or
 aortic stenosis.
