 HISTORY:  Chest pain and back pain x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is most likely due to atelectasis of a trace pleural
 effusion is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  Right paratracheal opacity with
 slight leftward deviation of trachea likely relates to patient's known
 enlarged thyroid gland.
