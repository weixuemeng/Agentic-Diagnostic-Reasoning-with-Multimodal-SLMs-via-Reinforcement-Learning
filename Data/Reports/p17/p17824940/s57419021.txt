 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. Peribronchial opacity in the left lower lobe is
 more conspicuous compared to prior studies, possibly reflecting aspiration or
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no large pleural
 effusion, overt pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable. The descending thoracic aorta is quite tortuous,
 unchanged compared to prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe peribronchial opacity could reflect aspiration or pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
