                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough and dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a
 left ventricular predominance is re- demonstrated.  Widening of the superior
 mediastinum is attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis, and is unchanged.  A
 moderate left pleural effusion is partially loculated laterally, and there is
 a continued rounded opacity within the left upper-mid lung field measuring up
 to 3.8 cm, likely reflective of rounded atelectasis as a similar appearance
 was noted on the previous chest CT.  No pulmonary edema is present, and there
 is no pneumothorax.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion.  Left basilar
 opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Marked degenerative change of the
 imaged thoracic spine is present with loss of height of multiple vertebral
 bodies as seen previously.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate left pleural effusion, partially loculated laterally, with
 adjacent left upper-mid lung field rounded opacity similar to that seen on the
 prior chest CT and felt to reflect rounded atelectasis.
 2. Left basilar opacity is most likely reflective of compressive atelectasis
 though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
