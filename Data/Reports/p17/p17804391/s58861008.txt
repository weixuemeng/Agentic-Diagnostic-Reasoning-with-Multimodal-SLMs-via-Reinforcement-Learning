  1.  Right chest tube tip likely deep within right cardiophrenic angle with
  side port in appropriate positioning. Differential includes intra-abdominal
  positioning. Clinical correlation is recommended. If persistent concern
  recommend a dedicated CT for further evaluation.
  2.  Hypoinflated lungs with right lower lobe atelectasis.
  3.  Stable moderate right apical and basilar pneumothorax.
  4.  Minimally displaced rib fracture through posterior sixth right rib.

  1.  Right chest tube tip likely deep within right cardiophrenic angle with
  side port in appropriate positioning. Differential includes intra-abdominal
  positioning although the absence of free intraperitoneal air is reassuring.
  Clinical correlation is recommended. Consider shallow oblique for further
  evaluation.
  2.  Hypoinflated lungs with right lower lobe atelectasis.
  3. Stable small right apical pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   Status post chest tube placement for pneumothorax. Assess chest
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with
 crowding of vasculature and right lower lobe atelectasis or contusion. No
 pleural effusion or left pneumothorax.  Stable moderate right apical and
 basilar pneumothorax.  A right chest tube courses inferioromedially, with
 apparent) abdominal course on lateral radiograph
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits. Minimally
 displaced rib fracture through posterior sixth right rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lying right chest tube, concerning for infradiaphragmatic extension.
 This could be further assessed by CT if warranted clinically.
 2.  Right lower lobe atelectasis or contusion.
 3.  Stable moderate right apical and basilar pneumothorax.
 4.  Minimally displaced rib fracture through posterior sixth right rib.
