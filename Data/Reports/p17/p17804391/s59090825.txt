                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Assess placement of right chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable shallow right oblique radiograph demonstrates right chest tube
 with tip coursing inferomedially and terminating adjacent to the T11-T12
 vertebral interspace level.
 Persistent opacity surrounding the chest tube is most consistent with
 atelectasis and post procedural changes. The visualized lower lungs are
 otherwise clear. Visualized heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable without free
 intraperitoneal air.  Minimally displaced rib fracture through posterior sixth
 right rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low position of right chest tube, for which in for diaphragmatic location
 cannot be excluded based on Single portable view.
 2.  Right basilar hydropneumothorax.
 3. Minimally displaced rib fracture through posterior sixth right rib.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 10:13 AM.
