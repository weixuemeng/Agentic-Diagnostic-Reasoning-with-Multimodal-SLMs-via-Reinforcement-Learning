 AP CHEST, 5:10 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The patient would not cooperate for standard positioning.  Lateral aspect of
 the left hemithorax is excluded from the examination.  Mild peribronchial
 opacification at the base of the right lung could be due to recent aspiration.
 Abnormality is more severe at the left lung base, more concerning for
 pneumonia.  Pleural effusion on the right is minimal.  Left cannot be assessed
 because the sulcus is excluded from the examination but there is no large left
 pleural effusion.  Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Heart is not enlarged.  No pneumothorax along the imaged pleural
 surfaces.
