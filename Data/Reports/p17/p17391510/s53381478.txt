                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post recent median sternotomy and aortic valve
 surgery.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Allowing for this factor, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable in the post-operative period except for resolution of
 pneumomediastinum.  Interval decrease in extent of bibasilar atelectasis, but
 persistent small pleural effusions.  No visible pneumothorax.
