                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman w high cervical injury, intubated, respiratory
 failure  // ? effusion, consolidation, ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs from ___, lung volumes have
 worsened and retrocardiac opacity has increased, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse.  Small left pleural effusion is new.  No large effusion on the
 right.  Right basilar opacities have improved.  Vascular congestion has
 improved and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  Heart size, which is
 difficult to assess in the setting of effusion, is mildly enlarged and
 unchanged.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, unchanged.  Right PIC line terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retrocardiac opacification reflects new left lower lobe collapse.  New
 small left pleural effusion.
 2. Improved right basilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
 3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
