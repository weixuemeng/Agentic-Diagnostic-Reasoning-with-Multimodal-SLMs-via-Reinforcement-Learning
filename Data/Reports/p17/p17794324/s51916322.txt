 now with intracranial hemorrhage, as well as recent Dobbhoff tube placement.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Dobbhoff tube terminates in the body of the
 stomach.  A left chest wall AICD device is unchanged in position, with leads
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved
 since the prior study.  Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with
 compressive bibasilar atelectasis are similar, allowing for technical
 differences.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube terminates in the stomach.
 2.  Improved pulmonary edema.
