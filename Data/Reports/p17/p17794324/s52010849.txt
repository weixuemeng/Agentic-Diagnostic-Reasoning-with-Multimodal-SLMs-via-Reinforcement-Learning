                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status and lactic acidosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable semi-AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. 
 Again noted is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device, which appears unchanged.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The
 right-sided pleural effusion appears decreased, but there is again a
 predominantly central widespread interstitial abnormality with indistinct
 pulmonary vasculature, most consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary
 edema.  In addition, the left hemidiaphragm is obscured by retrocardiac
 opacity, although not completely specific, most often due date coinciding
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Fairly similar degree of pulmonary edema compared to the last
 visit.  Persistent small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion, although
 decreased, but with persistent non-specific retrocardiac opacification.
