                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomegaly is stable compared to the prior study.  Persistent
 pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild-to-moderate perihilar and
 basilar edema, similar to the recent study allowing for positional differences
 between the exams.  Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are also
 demonstrated.
