                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, headache, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  On the lateral
 view, there is subtle opacity obscuring the lower T-spine, which could
 represent a lower lobe pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Otherwise,
 the lungs appear clear.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity posteriorly obscuring the spine on lateral view
 could represent a pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Otherwise
 unremarkable.
