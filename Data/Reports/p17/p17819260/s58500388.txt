                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope, question acute process in the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  As seen
 previously, there is a large retrocardiac opacity containing multiple
 air-fluid levels and large bowel haustrations compatible with large hiatal
 hernia.  The lungs appear clear and well expanded.  No signs of pneumonia or
 CHF.  No pleural effusion is or pneumothorax.  Given the large hiatal hernia,
 the cardiac size is difficult to accurately assess.  The mediastinal contour
 is unremarkable.  The bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large hiatal hernia as previously seen.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
