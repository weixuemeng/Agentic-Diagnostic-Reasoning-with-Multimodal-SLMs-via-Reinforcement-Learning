 There are increasing bibasilar opacities which could reflect bibasilar
 pneumonia, atelectasis, or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. There
 is possibly a small layering left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 although the vasculature appears is slightly cephalized which suggests
 pulmonary venous hypertension. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
