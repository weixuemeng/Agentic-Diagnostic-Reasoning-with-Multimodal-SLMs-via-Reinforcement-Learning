                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with restrictive lung physiology, intubated, rv
 failure  // Evaluation of ET tube and volume status, e/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 All lines, tubes, and support devices are unchanged in positioning. There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is increasing opacification within the
 right upper lung, which likely represents pneumonia, although this area is
 difficult to evaluate due to overlying devices.  The size of the bilateral
 pleural effusions is essentially unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of all lines and tubes.
 2. Increasing parenchymal opacification within the right upper lung, likely
 representing pneumonia, however this area is difficult to evaluate, and
 warrants attention on follow-up radiographs.
 3. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
