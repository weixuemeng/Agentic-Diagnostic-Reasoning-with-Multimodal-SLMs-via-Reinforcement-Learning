 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with irregular interstitial markings compatible

 left upper lobe and right middle lobe as well as the left lower lobe focal
 opacity are again seen.  There may be new superimposed opacity in the right
 middle lobe.  No definite interval change given differences in technique.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.

 Focal opacities in the left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe
 are not significantly changed since recent CT scan.
 Possible new focal opacity in the right middle lobe which could represent a
 superimposed acute infection.
