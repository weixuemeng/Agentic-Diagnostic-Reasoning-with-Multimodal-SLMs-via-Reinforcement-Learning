                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, back pain, evaluation for source of
 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Enlargement
 of the pulmonary arteries is again noted, unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic with associated
 a right basilar atelectasis.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base
 also is compatible atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is present.  Several anterior compression deformities within the
 thoracic spine appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Chronic right hemidiaphragmatic
 elevation with bibasilar atelectasis.  Enlarged pulmonary arteries bilaterally
 suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
