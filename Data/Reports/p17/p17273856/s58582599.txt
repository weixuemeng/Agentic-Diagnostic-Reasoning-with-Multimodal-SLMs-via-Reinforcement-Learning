 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, headstrike, head lac  // trauma?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  There are low inspiratory volumes.
 
 Heart size is borderline, but unchanged.  Aorta is calcified and unfolded.
 
 Mild prominence of vascular markings, but doubt overt CHF.  No focal opacity,
 frank consolidation, or gross effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Focal rounded opacity in the left suprahilar region most likely represents

 followup films is requested.
 
 No displaced rib fracture identified on these lung technique films.

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.  No obvious rib fractures, though nondisplaced rib
 fracture could be occult, particularly on these lung technique films.
 
 Mild vascular plethora, but doubt overt CHF.  No focal consolidation or
 effusion detected.
 
 Focal density left suprahilar region likely represents confluence of vascular
