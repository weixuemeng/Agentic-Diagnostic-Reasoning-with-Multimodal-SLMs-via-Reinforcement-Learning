                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall, bilateral crackles on exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary edema is present.  Linear
 opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Streaky atelectasis is also noted in the right lung base.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The osseous structures
 are diffusely demineralized with moderate multilevel degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.
