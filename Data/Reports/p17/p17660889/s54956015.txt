 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:11 PM
  ET tube 3.6 cm from the carina. Left sided IJ in low SVC - unchanged  Right
  siged large bore central catheter terminating in mid SVC - stable.  Dobhoff
  feeding tube at least in stomach - tip not imaged.  Diffuse bilateral alveolar
  opacities with basilar predominance appear unchanged - likely pulmonary edema.
   No large pleural effusions.  Stable hilar prominence and severe cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:53 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure secondary to atrial fibrillation with a rapid
 ventricular rate.  Recently re-intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved minimally since ___.  A
 large region of opacification in the right lower chest could be loculated
 pleural fluid or consolidation in the right lower lobe, a concern for
 pneumonia.  Uniform opacification in the left lower lobe, obscuring the entire
 diaphragmatic interface has worsened appreciably and could be due to pneumonia
 or dramatic worsening of atelectasis.  ET tube and left internal jugular line
 are in standard placements.  A large bore right-sided central venous catheter
 may hook into the azygos vein.  No pneumothorax.
