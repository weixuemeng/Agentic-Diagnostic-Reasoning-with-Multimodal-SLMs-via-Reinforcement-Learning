 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lower low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Bibasilar/perihilar opacities are similar in distribution compared to prior
 and most likely represent atelectasis however, infection is not excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
