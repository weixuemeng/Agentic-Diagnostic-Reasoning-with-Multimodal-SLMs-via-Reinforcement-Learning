                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, altered mental status, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Lung volumes are low.
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is likely due to low lung volumes. There is minimal atelectasis at
 the lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Rightward deviation of the trachea is re- demonstrated
 and due to a left-sided thyroid nodule. Multilevel degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
