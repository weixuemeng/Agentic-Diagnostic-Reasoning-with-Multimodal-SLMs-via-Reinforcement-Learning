                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CTA head and
 neck.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is normal.  Rightward deviation of
 the trachea with focal airway narrowing is unchanged and due to a large
 thyroid goiter.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged,
 and no pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Rightward deviation of the trachea with
 focal narrowing is compatible with known goiter.
