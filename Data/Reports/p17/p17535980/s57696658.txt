  4-mm nodular opacity projecting over the right medial lung base, possibly
  superimposition of normal thoracic structures, although a pulmonary nodule is
  not excluded.  Further evalution could be performed with a PA chest
  radiograph.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Reported fall earlier this week. 
 Evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously seen mild pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  A
 4 mm nodular opacity at the medial right lung base is seen only on the frontal
 projection and could be superimposed normal thoracic structures, although a
 pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart
 size is normal.  Deviation of the trachea to the right at the level of the
 thoracic inlet is not significantly changed, suggestive of enlargement of the
 left thyroid lobe.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary finding.
 
 2.  4 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right medial lung base, possibly
 secondary to superimposition of normal thoracic structures, although a
 pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  Further evaluation could be performed with
 a dedicated PA radiograph of the chest.
