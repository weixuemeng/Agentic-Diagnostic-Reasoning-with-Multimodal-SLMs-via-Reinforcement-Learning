                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness, dizziness, falls.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD.  Linear opacities
 within the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary vascular
 engorgement is present.  Deformity of the left proximal humerus suggests a
 remote fracture.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures
 with unchanged loss of height of a vertebral body at the thoracolumbar
 junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
