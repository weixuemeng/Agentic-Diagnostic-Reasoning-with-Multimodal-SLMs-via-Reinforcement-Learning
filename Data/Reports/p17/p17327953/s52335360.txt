                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tachycardia, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable chest radiograph is obtained.  Overlying EKG
 leads are present, somewhat limiting the evaluation.  However, allowing for
 this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
