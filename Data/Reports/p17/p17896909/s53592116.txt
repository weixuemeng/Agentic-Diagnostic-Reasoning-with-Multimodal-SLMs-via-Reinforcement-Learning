                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic stenosis, EKG changes c/w ACS  // ETT
 Placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 the ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  There is a left IJ line with tip
 in the mid SVC.  Again noted is right upper lobe collapse. The heart is
 severely enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution.  The right
 hilum can't be adequately assessed secondary to the right upper lobe collapse.
 However the left hilum is very prominent.  Is unclear if this is due to
 vascular congestion or adenopathy. There is hazy alveolar infiltrates left
 greater than right
