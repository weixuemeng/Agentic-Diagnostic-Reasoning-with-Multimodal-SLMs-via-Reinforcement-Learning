                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm which is persistent, although exaggerated by low lung
 volumes today.  A right-sided port terminates in appropriate position.  No
 focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  Cardiac
 size is top normal, and there is an increase in the vasculature, although this
 is likely due to low lung volumes as the patient did not respond to breathing
 instructions.  No nondisplaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
