                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION: status post PEA arrest and with anoxic brain injury. Post
 intubation. .
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison
 with prior chest radiographs through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The orogastric tube is partially coiled in the cervical esophagus;
 however, the rest of its course can be traced below the diaphragm into the
 body of the stomach, but its tip is beyond the radiographic view. 
 Endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicles. 
 Consider advancing the ET tube by 2 cm for better seating.  Subclavian line
 through the right side ends at the lower SVC.  Bilateral lungs are remarkable
 for opacities in the lower medial lungs, likely from aspiration.  Upper lungs
 are clear.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral lower medial lung opacities, likely aspiration.
 
 2.  Orogastric tube ends into the stomach, but is partially coiled in the
 cervical esophagus.
 
 The findings were communicated to Dr ___ on ___ at approximately
 10:28 a.m.
