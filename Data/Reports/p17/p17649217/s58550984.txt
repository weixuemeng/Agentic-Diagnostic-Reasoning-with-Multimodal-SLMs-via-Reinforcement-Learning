                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post trauma with desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at approximately 2:30 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval advancement of the endotracheal tube, which
 now ends 5.8 cm above the carina.  An esophageal catheter traverses below the
 diaphragm with tip projecting over the L2 vertebral body, likely within the
 distal stomach.  The left costophrenic angle is not included in this image. 
 Within this limitation, there is no evidence for focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Pulmonary edema has nearly resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube repositionned in standard location.
