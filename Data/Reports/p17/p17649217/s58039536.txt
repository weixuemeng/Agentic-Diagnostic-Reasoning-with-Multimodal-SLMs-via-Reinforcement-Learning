                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with anoxic brain injury, now with likely VAP,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Left subclavian central line has its tip in the
 low SVC, unchanged from the prior examination.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  The ET tube is
 approximately 5.2 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes with bilateral
 airspace opacities are noted.  This is consistent with pulmonary edema,
 improved since most recent prior examination.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly, increased
 since most recent prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Improved mild pulmonary edema.  
 2. Consolidation within the retrocardiac region may represent atelectasis;
 however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
