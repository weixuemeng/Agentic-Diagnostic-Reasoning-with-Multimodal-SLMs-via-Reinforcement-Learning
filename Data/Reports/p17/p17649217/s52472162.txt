 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.3 cm above the carina.  Right subclavian
 central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 Interval reduction of lung volumes with bilateral airspace process which could
 reflect pulmonary edema.  More focal retrocardiac opacity is also again
 identified which may reflect lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.
