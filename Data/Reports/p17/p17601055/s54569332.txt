                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sarcoid, smoking, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Due to technical problems, no direct comparison is available at
 the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no evidence of hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy.  Moderate scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the rib
 cage.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  On the lateral radiograph only,
 zone of slightly increased peribronchial tissue is seen at the lower aspect of
 the hilar structures.  The described appearance could be normal but could also
 indicate minimal peribronchial disease.  Reevaluation will be performed once
 the previous radiograph is available for comparison.
