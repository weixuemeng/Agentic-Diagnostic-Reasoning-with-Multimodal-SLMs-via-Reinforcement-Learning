                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of sarcoid and family history of
 thoracic aortic aneurysm, here to evaluate for pulmonary sarcoid or abnormal
 thoracic aorta.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate.  The lungs are clear
 without pleural effusion, consolidation or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  A gas bubble in the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen may indicate colonic interposition, but is
 not clearly visualized as such on the corresponding lateral radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pulmonary findings to suggest sarcoidosis.
