 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are hyperinflated but
 essentially clear.  There is no evidence of interstitial lung disease to
 suggest amiodarone lung toxicity.  The pacemaker leads terminate in right
 atrium and right ventricle.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
