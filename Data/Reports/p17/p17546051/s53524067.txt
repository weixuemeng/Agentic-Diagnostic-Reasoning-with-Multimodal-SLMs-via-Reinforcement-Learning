 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:40 PM
  There is interval retraction of the right PICC, with tip now projecting over
  the right subclavian vein, closer to the axilla. Cardiomegaly is stable
  however there is increased opacification in the right lower lung which likely
  represents increased asymmetric pulmonary edema given the waxing and waning
  pulmonary edema seen over the last several radiographs; however in the
  appropriate clinical context infection cannot be excluded

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___. Correlation made to CT
 abdomen/pelvis dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a right PICC line again projects over the mid right subclavian
 vein. The enteric tube has been removed. The tip of a newly placed right IJ
 central venous line projects over the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Lung
 volumes are low. There is a stable moderate layering right pleural effusion,
 and a stable small left pleural effusion. The left lung is clear. There is
 stable cardiomegaly despite the projection. The mediastinal contours are
 stable. Aortic arch calcifications are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of newly placed right PICC line again projects over the mid right
 subclavian vein.
 
 Stable moderate layering right and small left pleural effusions.
