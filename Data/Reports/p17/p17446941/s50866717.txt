                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Ten-day history of cough and increased dyspnea on exertion,
 recently completed antibiotic treatment without improvement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and chest radiograph.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size remains mild-to-moderately
 enlarged.  Extensive calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are again
 demonstrated with upward retraction of the hila bilaterally, and biapical
 fibrosis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is compatible with
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No new areas of focal consolidation are
 present.  There are calcified bilateral breast implants present, and partially
 imaged is a right humeral head prosthesis.  There is diffuse demineralization
 of the osseous structures with mild compression deformity of a low thoracic
 vertebral body, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little interval change from prior with findings compatible with
 sarcoidosis.  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.  No new areas of
 focal consolidation identified.
