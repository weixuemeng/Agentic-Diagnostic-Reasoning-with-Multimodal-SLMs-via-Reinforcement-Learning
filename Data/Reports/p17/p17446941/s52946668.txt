                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There has been no significant interval change.  Again
 seen is biapical scarring with retraction of the hila superiorly and bilateral
 calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes compatible with sarcoidosis. 
 Blunting of the posterior and lateral costophrenic angles are suggestive of
 small pleural effusions.  There is no new confluent consolidation.  Cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but stable.  Osseous structures again notable for right
 shoulder arthroplasty.  Partially calcified breast implants again noted.  Mild
 compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes compatible with sarcoidosis.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions, not significantly changed.  Otherwise, no significant
 change since prior.
