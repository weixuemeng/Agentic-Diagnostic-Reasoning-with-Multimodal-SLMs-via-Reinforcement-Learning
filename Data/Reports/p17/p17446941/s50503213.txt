                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Numerous bilateral mediastinal and hilar calcified lymph nodes are again seen
 without significant interval change.  Biapical scarring with upward retraction
 of the hila is unchanged.  The lungs remain hyperinflated, with flattening of
 the diaphragms.  Since the prior study, there has been increased blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion. 
 Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis in underlying consolidation is not excluded.  A trace right
 pleural effusion be difficult to exclude.  The cardiac silhouette is stably
 enlarged.  Calcified breast implants are seen overlying the lower thorax
 bilaterally.  Partially imaged is a right humeral prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval blunting of the left costophrenic angle and development of left base
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although an underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Difficult
 to exclude trace right pleural effusion.
 
 Stable chronic changes consistent with sarcoidosis including numerous
 calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, upward retraction of the hila and
 scarring in the upper lobes and to a lesser extent bibasilar scarring. 
 Hyperinflated lungs suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
