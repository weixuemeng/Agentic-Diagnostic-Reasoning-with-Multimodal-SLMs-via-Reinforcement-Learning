                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with COPD p/w FTT  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs most recent on ___ and
 chest CT on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within normal limits. The
 lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD. A right upper lobe nodular
 opacity is re- demonstrated and not significantly changed from the prior chest
 radiograph on ___. Subtle bibasilar opacities are seen which may
 represent atelectasis, aspiration or infection. There is increased opacity at
 the right base, which may represent a focus of atelectasis or pneumonia.  No
 large pleural efusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lateral right basilar opacity, new from prior , could represent atelectasis,
 infection, aspiration.  Left basilar opacity again seen, stable.
