                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___.  CT
 of the chest without contrast dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an irregular nodular opacity in the right upper lobe
 measuring 1.8 x 1.3 cm, which may represent the previously biopsied right
 upper lobe lesion.  There is increased opacification of the right paratracheal
 stripe, unchanged from the prior chest radiograph.  There is no focal
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  No significant pleural effusion or
 definitive pneumothorax is detected.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs and
 evidence of right upper lobe predominant emphysema as seen on the prior chest
 CT.  The thoracic aorta remains tortuous with stable cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours on the most recent prior chest radiograph.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 
 2.  1.8 cm right upper lobe nodular opacity appears stable at the right lung
 apex and perhaps even slightly decreased.  Surveillance is recommended with CT
 or chest radiography however.  Otherwise, stable appearance of the right lung
 apex.
 
 3.  Evidence of COPD/emphysema.
