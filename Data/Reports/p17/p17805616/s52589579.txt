                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with COPD, with bullous and fibrotic
 changes that make it difficult to evaluate for possible pneumothorax.  A small
 right apical pneumothorax cannot be definitely excluded.  Continued relative
 increased opacification at the left base with a differential diagnosis as
 described in the previous study of atelectasis, fibrosis, aspiration, or
 supervening pneumonia depending on the clinical context.  
 
 No change in the nodular opacifications in the right upper zone.
