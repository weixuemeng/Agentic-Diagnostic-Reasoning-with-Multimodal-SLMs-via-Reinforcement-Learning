                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest, AP and lateral.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is nodular opacity
 in the right upper lobe, unchanged from the prior study.  Also, there is a
 possible pleural contour on the right which may indicate a small right apical
 pneumothorax.  There is increased opacity in the left lower lobe.  Thickening
 of the right paratracheal stripe is unchanged.  The heart size is normal and
 the aorta is unfolded.  There is no pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity
 is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Possible small right apical pneumothorax.  Repeat upright radiograph with
 inspiratory/expiratory views is recommended.
 2. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe may represent atelectasis,
 aspiration, or pneumonia, depending on the clinical context.
 3. Hyperinflation of the lungs, consistent with COPD.
 4. Nodular opacities in the right upper lobe, unchanged from the prior study.
