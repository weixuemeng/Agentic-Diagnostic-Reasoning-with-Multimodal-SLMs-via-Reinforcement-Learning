                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough immediately after right transbronchial biopsy.  Evaluate
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Intraoperative fluoroscopic views from the procedure taken on
 ___ at ___.  Comparison radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A bedside AP radiograph of the chest redemonstrates the multifocal
 opacities of which the right upper lobe lesion was biopsied.  The scapula now
 overlies this site, which may obscure local hemorrhage at the biopsy site. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The aorta is stably tortuous
 but the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of immediate post-procedure complication, however a repeat
 study may be obtained to rule out occult hemorrhage overlying the right
 scapula.
 2.  Multiple lung nodules redemonstrated.
