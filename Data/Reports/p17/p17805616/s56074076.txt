                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with end-stage COPD and severe anemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous, and enlargement of
 the main pulmonary artery is again suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysematous changes again
 noted.  No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.  Patchy and somewhat nodular
 opacities within the right upper lobe as well as within both lower lobes
 likely reflect areas of bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction, bronchial wall
 thickening, and inflammation.  The findings in the right upper lobe appear
 relatively unchanged compared to the previous radiograph, with the opacities
 in the lung bases appearing more evident.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening patchy and somewhat nodular opacities in both lung bases which may
 reflect exacerbation of chronic airways disease and bronchiectasis. 
 Relatively similar appearance of patchy and nodular opacities in the right
 upper lobe.  Severe emphysema.
