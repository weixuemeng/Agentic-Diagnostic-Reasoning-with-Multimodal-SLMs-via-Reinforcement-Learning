 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with ARDS after intubation and treatment for
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Improvement in the widespread ground-glass opacification, basal predominant,
 and mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality between ___ and ___ has stalled.  The distribution and upper lobe and mild mediastinal vascular
 engorgement and small pleural effusion, suggest at least a component of
 cardiogenic or volume dependent edema.  The more consolidative abnormality at
 the left lung base is likely pneumonia.
 
 ET tube, right PIC line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard
 placements.  Left internal jugular introducer ends at the origin of the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size has remained normal
 throughout.
