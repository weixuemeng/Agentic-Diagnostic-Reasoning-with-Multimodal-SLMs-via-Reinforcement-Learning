 AP CHEST, 4:47 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with ARDS and pneumonia.  Recently intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube, right internal jugular line, upper enteric drainage tube in standard
 placements.  Second esophageal device ends midway between the carina and the
 diaphragm, presumably temperature or pressure probe.  Left internal jugular
 dual-channel catheter ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion is layering posteriorly, obscuring detail in the right lower
 lobe, which could be partially consolidated or focally edematous, but not
 appreciably changed than the left.  Upper lungs are hyperlucent, reflecting
 emphysema.  The heart is normal size.
