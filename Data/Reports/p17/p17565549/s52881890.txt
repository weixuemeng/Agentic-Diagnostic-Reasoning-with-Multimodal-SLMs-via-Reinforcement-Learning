 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:26 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is worsening

 have also increased in extent.  Ill-defined airspace opacities, predominantly
 in the perihilar regions, could indicate coexisting pneumonia.  The monitoring
 and support devices are constant.
