                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ARDS, intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Endotracheal tube is partially obscured by esophageal balloon and upper
 alimentary drainage tube which ends in the upper stomach.  The ET tube goes at
 least as far as the lower margin of the clavicles, but probably not beyond
 that, putting the tip no less than 8.5 cm above the carina, warranting
 advancement, roughly 3 cm.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC, left internal jugular line ends at
 the origin of the left brachiocephalic vein.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Hyperinflation indicates COPD.  What began as lateral lower lobe pneumonia and
 mild pulmonary edema on ___ has shown varying components of edema. 
 Today, the edema has probably worsened since ___, but there is clearly
 more opacification in the right upper lung than the left.  Either the edema is
 gravity dependent the patient lies on his left side, or pneumonia still severe
 in the right lower lobe is progressing superiorly.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, probably moderate in size on the right, smaller on the left.  The
 heart is normal size.  Mediastinal veins are fuller today than on previous
 studies, but not severely distended.
