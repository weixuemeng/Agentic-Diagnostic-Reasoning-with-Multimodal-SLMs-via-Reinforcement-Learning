                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Crackles in the lung bases in a patient with COPD.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions that appear to be increased in the
 interim.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including the
 bilateral paramediastinal parenchymal opacities, consistent with
 post-radiation changes.  Overall, no substantial new finding since the prior
 radiograph demonstrated.
