                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or CHF in a patient with shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and fairly well-aerated lungs.  Linear opacities in the bilateral
 lung bases are compatible with atelectasis, as before.  There is no definite
 focal consolidation or pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
