                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with subglottic stenosis s/p dilation,
 re-intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure  // interval change     interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube tip lies
 approximately 3 cm above the carina other monitoring and support devices are
 stable.  Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs given
 the change in obliquity of the patient.  Retrocardiac opacification is
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable
 pleural fluid.  Hazy opacification at the right base again raises the
 possibility of layering effusion with some atelectatic changes.
