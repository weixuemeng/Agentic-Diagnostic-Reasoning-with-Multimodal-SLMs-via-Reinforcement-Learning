 Right upper lobe opacity appears to be new as compared to previous study,
 potentially representing crowd nurse of the vasculature but nodules cannot be
 excluded.  Similar finding is suspected inferior to the right hilus. Heart
 size and mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Assessment of those FINDINGS with chest CT is required
