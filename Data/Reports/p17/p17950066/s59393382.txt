                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Infiltrate seen on x-ray earlier this month with some chest
 congestion. Rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are increased bibasilar opacities, left greater than right. There is
 blunting of the right posterior costophrenic angle, likely related to pleural
 fluid. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by overlying opacities.
 Upper lungs are well aerated.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities, potentially due to
 atelectasis, a component of infection, although chronic process is also
 possible. Correlation with priors would be helpful. Repeat evaluation is
 recommended upon completion of treatment.
 
 2. Right sided pleural effusion.
