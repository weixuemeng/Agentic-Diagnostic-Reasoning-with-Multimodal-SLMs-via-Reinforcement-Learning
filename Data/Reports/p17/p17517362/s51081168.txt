 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreaticopleural fistula, evaluation for interval change of
 pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in constant position.  There is a clear increase in extent of the
 bilateral pleural effusions, combined to increasing opacity at both lung
 bases, likely atelectatic in origin.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  No
 convincing evidence for pneumothorax.
