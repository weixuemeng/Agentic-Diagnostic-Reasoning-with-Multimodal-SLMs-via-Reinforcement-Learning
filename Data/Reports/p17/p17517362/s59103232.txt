                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC has been re-positioned, with tip now terminating in the
 proximal right atrium.  Additional withdrawal of approximately 3.5 cm would
 place the catheter in the lower superior vena cava.  There has otherwise been
 no substantial short interval change in the appearance of the chest since the
 recent study performed several hours earlier.
