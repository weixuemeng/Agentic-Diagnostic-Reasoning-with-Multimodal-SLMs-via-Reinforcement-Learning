                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left PICC terminates within the lower superior vena cava.  Right
 subclavian central venous catheter has been removed, with no visible
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small-to-moderate in
 size, with possible interval increase in size on the right although positional
 differences limit comparison.  Bilateral mid and lower lung heterogeneous
 opacities have also slightly worsened, and raise the concern for infectious
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Persistent left retrocardiac
 atelectasis.
