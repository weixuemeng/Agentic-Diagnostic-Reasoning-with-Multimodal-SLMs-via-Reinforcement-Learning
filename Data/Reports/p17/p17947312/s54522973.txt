 vasculature is not engorged.  Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in
 the lung bases, more so on the right.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.

 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases which could reflect
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
