                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with significant cardiac history including CHF,
 with new weakness, dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
 demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.  Upper zone
 vascular redistribution with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is
 demonstrated along with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
 left.  Patchy ill-defined opacities in both lung bases could reflect
 compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 compressive atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
