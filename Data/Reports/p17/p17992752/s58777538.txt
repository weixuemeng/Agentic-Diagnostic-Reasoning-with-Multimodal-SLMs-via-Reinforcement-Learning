                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fall/headstrike
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains normal in size.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with
 scarring noted at the lung apices.  11 mm spiculated nodular opacity within
 the left upper lobe appears grossly unchanged compared to the previous chest
 radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  11 mm spiculated nodular opacity in the
 left upper lobe is grossly unchanged, but should be better evaluated with CT
 of the chest for direct comparison with prior CT chest.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest for improved comparison of the left upper lobe
 spiculated nodule.
