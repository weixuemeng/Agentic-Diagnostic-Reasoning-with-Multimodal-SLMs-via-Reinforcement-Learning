                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall with left hip fracture, assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi supine chest radiograph was obtained.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is rotated.  The lungs are somewhat low in volume but
 appear clear aside from bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 with tortuous aortic contour.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without acute process.
