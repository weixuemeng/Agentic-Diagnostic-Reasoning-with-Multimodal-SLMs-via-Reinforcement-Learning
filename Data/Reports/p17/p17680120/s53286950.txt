 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy
 wires are again seen.  There is stable retrocardiac opacity which likely
 represents a hiatal hernia.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  There is
 no evidence of local consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  There is a dysplastic appearance of the bilateral humeral
 heads, which appear medially dislocated.  This finding appears essentially
 stable from multiple prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute findings.
