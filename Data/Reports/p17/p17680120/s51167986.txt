                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is rotated somewhat to the right.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and somewhat globular in
 configuration, which may be due to cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. 
 The aortic knob remains calcified.  Subtle retrocardiac rounded opacity may
 relate patient's hiatal hernia.  There is very minimal interstitial edema.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Chronic deformities of the shoulder joints are partially
 imaged.
