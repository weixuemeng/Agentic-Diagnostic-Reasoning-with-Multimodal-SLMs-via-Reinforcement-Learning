 from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  No focal
 consolidation is identified. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The
 cardiac silhouette is normal. Calcifications of the tracheobronchial tree as
 well as the aortic arch are noted. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Chronic bilateral humeral
 head deformities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes but no focal consolidation. Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
