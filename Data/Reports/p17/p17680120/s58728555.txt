 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with worseninig o2 req, shock  // r/o edema,
 PNA      r/o edema, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 1:18 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain very low, and the opacification at the lung bases is
 probably vascular crowding and mild atelectasis, but it could mask aspiration
 and early pneumonia in should be followed.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement has
 improved minimally since earlier in the day. I do not see pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  Heart is mildly enlarged, as before.  Right
 jugular line ends in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax
