                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post resolved upper GI bleed, now with altered mental status.
 Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a right internal jugular
 catheter unchanged in position with the tip in the low SVC.  Lung volumes are
 lower than on prior radiograph, resulting in increased vascular crowding and
 apparent interval increase in heart size.  Increased opacity adjacent
 to/overlying the right heart border may be secondary to low lung volumes and
 continued vascular engorgement overlying the right heart border, but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  There are bilateral moderate to
 large pleural effusions, likely right greater than left, with associated
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased opacity adjacent to/overlying the right heart border may be
 secondary to low lung volumes and continued vascular engorgement overlying the
 right heart border, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 
 2. Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions, likely right greater than
 left, with associated bibasilar atelectasis.  
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
