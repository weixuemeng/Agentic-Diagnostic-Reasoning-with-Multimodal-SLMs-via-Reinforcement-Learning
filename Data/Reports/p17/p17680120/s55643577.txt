                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable with the cardiac silhouette
 enlarged and the aorta is calcified.  Evidence of large hiatal hernia is again
 seen, with adjacent atelectasis.  Subtle right paratracheal opacity is stable
 since a least CT from ___ scout images and likely relates to
 vasculature.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  There has been
 interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous catheter.  There
 is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be due to a
 trace pleural effusion.  Chronic deformities of the shoulder joints/proximal
 humeri all are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to trace pleural
 effusion.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Retrocardiac opacity likely due to
 known hiatal hernia.  No definite focal consolidation.
