                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset AFib with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, question
 pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low which limits evaluation.  Since the prior exam, the right
 effusion has resolved.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No overt
 evidence of CHF or pneumonia.  Vague retrocardiac opacity is noted in the left
 lower lobe which is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No overt signs of pneumonia or CHF.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
