                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib pain and hemoptysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung
 volumes.  There has been the development of increased opacification at the
 right base posteriorly, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumothorax or definite rib fracture.  
 
 The left lung is essentially clear with minimal atelectatic changes at the
 base.
