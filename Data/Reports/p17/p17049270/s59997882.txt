                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely top normal.  The mediastinal contour appears widened, likely
 due to low lung volumes, with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is hazy opacification within both lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 likely present though infection cannot be excluded.
