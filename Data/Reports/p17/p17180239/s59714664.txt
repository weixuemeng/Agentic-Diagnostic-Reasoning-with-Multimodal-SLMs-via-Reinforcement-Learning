                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe COPD, admitted for GI bleed.  // any
 acute intrapulmonary process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.  CT abdomen pelvis ___. 
 Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded and the hemidiaphragms flattened compatible with
 history of COPD.  Large lucencies in both lungs correspond to bulla seen on CT
 of ___.  Worsening opacity at the right base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  Consolidations at the left base seen on recent CT of the abdomen
 and pelvis likely persist but are not well seen on this study.  There is
 scarring and pleural thickening at the lung apices which is minimally worse
 since ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Severe COPD.
 2. Opacity at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis.  Consolidation at
 the left base seen on CT the abdomen pelvis ___ not well
 appreciated on this study.  These findings may be accounted for by recurrent
 episodes of aspiration.
 3. Scarring and pleural thickening at the lung apices is minimally worse since
 ___.  If patient has symptoms referable to this findings such as Horner's
 syndrome, arm or shoulder pain further workup with repeat contrast-enhanced
 chest CT may be performed.
