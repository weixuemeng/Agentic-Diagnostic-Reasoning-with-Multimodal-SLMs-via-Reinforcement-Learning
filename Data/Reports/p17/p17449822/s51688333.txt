 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an NG tube, which traverses the diaphragm and ascends

 stomach. Stable bilateral low lung volumes, probably a combination of poor
 inspiration and slight lordotic positioning. The lungs are otherwise clear,

 pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette, hila, and pleura. No
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Appropriately placed NG tube.
