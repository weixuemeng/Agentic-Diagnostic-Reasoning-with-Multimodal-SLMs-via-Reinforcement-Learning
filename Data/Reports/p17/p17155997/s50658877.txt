                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mesenteric ischemia with post-operative leukocytosis, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is substantial
 increase in opacification at the left base posteriorly.  This is consistent
 with some combination of pleural effusion, underlying atelectasis, and
 possible supervening pneumonia.  Opacification at the right base most likely
 represents atelectasis.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  No definite vascular
 calcification.
 
 When compared to the study of ___, there is little change in the
 compression of a mid dorsal vertebral body.
