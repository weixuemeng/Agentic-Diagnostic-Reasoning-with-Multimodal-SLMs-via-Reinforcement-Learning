                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung mass, R lung consolidation, s/p
 bronchoscopy and biopsy  // Evaluate for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following the recent
 biopsy procedure.  Postobstructive collapse and consolidation persists in the
 right upper lobe distal to a large neoplastic mass. Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for apparent decrease in size of right pleural effusion with
 adjacent improved aeration of the right lung base and resolution of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
