                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male transferred and intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside facility chest radiograph ___ at 15:50, chest CT
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube seen
 with tip past the GE junction although side port is likely in the distal
 esophagus.  Known right lung mass occupying a majority of the right midlung is
 better assessed by recent chest CT performed earlier on the same date.  There
 is new right basilar atelectasis medially.
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is a blunting of the right lateral
 costophrenic angle in part due to prominent extrapleural fat although
 underlying effusion is possible.  No sizable pleural effusion on the left.  No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Heart size may be
 minimally enlarged.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina.
 2. Enteric tube tip likely just past the GE junction with side-port in the
 distal esophagus.
 3. Mild interstitial edema.
 4. Right lung mass, better assessed by same-day CT.
