                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation  // placement?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below
 the diaphragm. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with
 aspiration or infection. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent
 with atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is not excluded. No
 pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity, consistent with infection or aspiration. Followup
 radiograph after treatment is recommended to assess for resolution.
