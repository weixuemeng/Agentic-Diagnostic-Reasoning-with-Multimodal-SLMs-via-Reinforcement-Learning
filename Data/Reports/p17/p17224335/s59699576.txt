                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of CAD, AS, SOB and ___,
 evaluate for flash pulmonary edema, r/o underlying PNA.
 
 Per OMR, the patient has had recent AVR/CABG on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The dual-lumen left central venous catheter has been removed in the interim. 
 Lung volumes remain low.  A small right pleural effusion is essentially
 unchanged.  A large left pleural effusion is probably overall unchanged as
 well with adjacent parenchymal opacities that most likely reflect atelectasis;
 however, concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate situation.
 There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary
 edema.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve replacement as well as
 mediastinal clips are overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is
 stably enlarged, although difficult to fully assess in the setting of the left
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Large left pleural effusion with probable associated compressive lower
 lobe atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Small right pleural effusion, unchanged.
 
 3.  No pulmonary edema.
