 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 has been removed.  Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities are increased in
 density from ___ with decreased lung volumes since that time.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased lung volumes with increased density of bilateral
 parenchymal opacities, compatible with ARDS.
