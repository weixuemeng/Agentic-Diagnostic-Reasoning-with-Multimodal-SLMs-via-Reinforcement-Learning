 INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema status post heroin overdose treated with Narcan.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes remain low.  There is improved aeration of the

 opacities.  No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. 
 There is pulmonary venous congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 prominent but decreased in size from ___.  An endotracheal tube and

 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the upper lungs with persistent bilateral
 parenchymal opacities may reflect an improved component of pulmonary edema.
 Improvement in ARDS is difficult to ascertain.
