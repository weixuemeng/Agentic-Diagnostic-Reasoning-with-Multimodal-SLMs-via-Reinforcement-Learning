                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:41 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure, possible ARDS.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Severe widespread pulmonary consolidation has improved minimally
 radiographically, but since lung volumes are greater, the apparent improvement
 may reflect increased positive pressure ventilation, rather than clinical
 improvement.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly persists.  Widespread pulmonary opacification likely
 non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is still quite severe.  Pleural effusions are
 presumed, but not large.  ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in
 standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
