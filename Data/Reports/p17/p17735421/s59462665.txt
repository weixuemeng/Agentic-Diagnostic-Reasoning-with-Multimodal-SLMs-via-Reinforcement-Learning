  1. Interval increase of a now moderate-sized right pneumothorax. Heart shifted
  mildly towards the left. No flattening of the diaphragm. Clinical correlation
  is recommended to assess for signs of tension.
  2. Bibasilar atelectasis as well as pulmonary contusions.
  3. Minimally displaced right C6 and nondisplaced C7 rib fractures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fall with traumatic pneumothorax. Assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates
 hypoinflated lungs with a small sized right pneumothorax, which has increased
 from CT performed earlier that day. No flattening of the hemidiaphragm. The
 heart is mildly shifted leftwards.  No left pneumothorax. Bibasilar
 atelectasis is noted. Scattered bilateral heterogeneous opacities most
 prominent within the lung apices likely represents contusions or mild
 pulmonary fibrosis as seen on CT chest. Mild cardiomegaly noted. Mediastinal
 contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. No pleural effusion.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for a minimally
 displaced right C6 and nondisplaced C7 rib fractures. Degenerative changes
 throughout the thoracolumbar spine. Visualized upper abdomen is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase of a small right pneumothorax. Heart is slightly shifted
 towards the left. No flattening of the diaphragm. Clinical correlation is
 recommended to assess for signs of tension.
 2.  Bibasilar atelectasis as well as pulmonary contusions or mild pulmonary
 fibrosis, best seen on CT performed ___.  Close interval followup
 is recommended.
 3.  Minimally displaced right C6 and nondisplaced C7 rib fractures.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with primary
 team in person on ___ at 3:50 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
