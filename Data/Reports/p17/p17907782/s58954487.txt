                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rising white count, recent stroke and dysphagia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 14:42 p.m., there is increased opacity at the left
 lung base, likely a combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  This has progressed slightly compared with the earlier
 film.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring,
 suggesting CHF.  Probable atelectasis at the right base, with minimal blunting
 of the costophrenic angle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the
 left base, increased compared with one day earlier.  
 
 2.  CHF with vascular plethora and mild interstitial blurring.
 
 3.  Atelectasis and minimal blunting of right costophrenic angle, unchanged.
