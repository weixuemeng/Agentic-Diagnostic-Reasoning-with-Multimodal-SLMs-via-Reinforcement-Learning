                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right MCA stroke, NG tube for feeding.  Assess position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 An NG tube is present -- the tip and sideport extend beneath the diaphragm and
 overlie the expected location of the stomach.  There is mild-to-moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The aorta is densely calcified.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, with mild vascular plethora.  There is some patchy increased
 retrocardiac density, with slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and a
 small left effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, possibly
 with a small right effusion.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 13:54 p.m., the NG tube is new.  CHF findings may be
 very slightly improved.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An NG tube tip and sideport extend beneath the diaphragm and overlie the
 expected location of the stomach.
