 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with SOB s/p chemo, patient has a history of myxofibrosarcoma
 with lung metastasis // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided port catheter terminates in the low SVC.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits. The heart is normal in size.  There is a
 small to moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Please note
 underlying pneumonia difficult to exclude. There is a rounded nodular opacity
 seen in the right lower lobe, consistent with known pulmonary metastasis
 measuring 2.6 cm, characterized on prior CT.  The opacity is seen projecting
 over the thoracic spine on the lateral view. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are noted in the left axilla.

 1. Right lower lobe lung metastatic nodule redemonstrated.
 2. Small to moderate left effusion with subjacent atelectasis, cannot exclude
 pneumonia.
 3. Port-A-Cath in place with tip in the low SVC.
