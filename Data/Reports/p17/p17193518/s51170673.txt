                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stage 4 CKD 4 day status post fall. Last
 platelet count was ___.  Left supraorbital abrasion, left flank pain,
 hematuria.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Diffuse increased interstitial opacities are
 noted, more pronounced on the left, concerning for chronic interstitial lung
 disease.  More focal opacities in the left lung base and left upper lobe could
 reflect areas of superimposed contusion, but this is difficult to determine
 without the presence of prior exams.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities concerning for chronic interstitial
 lung disease.  Comparison with prior imaging would be helpful to assess
 whether the more focal opacities in the left upper and lower lobes may reflect
 areas of superimposed contusion.  No acutely displaced fractures identified.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 
 If there is continued concern for an acute rib fracture, consider a dedicated
 rib series.
