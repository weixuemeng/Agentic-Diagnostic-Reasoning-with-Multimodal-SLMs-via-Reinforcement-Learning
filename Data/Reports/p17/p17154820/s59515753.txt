                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and recent right internal jugular
 central venous line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter is in
 place with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  A metallic vascular
 stent is seen projecting superior to the aortic knob which is calcified. 
 Multiple postsurgical changes are present within the lungs, including chain
 sutures within the righ upper lobe, presumably from prior lobectomy, as well
 as mediastinal clips in this area.  
 
 Within the left lung, there is a spiculated mass within the upper lobe, as
 well as pleural thickening and a large left pleural effusion which obscures
 the left heart border.  Within the right lung, there is perihilar
 indistinctnes, reflecting mild pulmonary edema.  Note is made of surgical
 clips within the left neck as well.  There is slight tracheal deviation,
 possibly due to enlarged thyroid. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Left upper lobe opacity could conceivably be due to loculated pleural
 fluid, although given spiculated appearance, a solid mass is likely, and CT
 should be performed for further characterization.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary edema and left pleural effusion.
