                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, worse with inspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumomediastinum.  No displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, appears slightly larger as compared to the
 prior study, although this may relate to lower lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum.
