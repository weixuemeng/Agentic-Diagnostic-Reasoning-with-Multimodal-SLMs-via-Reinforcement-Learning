                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. 
 Opacification at the left base most likely reflects atelectatic change, though
 in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 
 Right lung shows minimal atelectasis at the base and there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion.
