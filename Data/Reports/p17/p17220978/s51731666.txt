                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sterntomoy.  Perihilar opacification on
 the left appears unchanged and is probably post-surgical.  Superimposed is a
 generalized hazy opacification of each lung, with indistinct pulmonary
 vessels, most suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  It is difficult
 to exclude small pleural effusions and the retrocardiac area is
 under-penetrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema.
