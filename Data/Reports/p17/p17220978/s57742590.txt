 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary fibrosis, status post wedge resection.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is 4.5 cm above the carina.  Right-sided chest tube is
 against the spine.  Sternal wires are again visualized.  Again seen are
 indistinct pulmonary vessels and diffuse areas of alveolar and interstitial
 opacity.  The overall appearance is of that of the chronic known interstitial
 fibrosis with superimposed pulmonary edema.  The acute pulmonary edema is
 slightly worse compared to prior study.
