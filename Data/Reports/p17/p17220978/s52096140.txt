 An NG tube is noted with the tip and side port within the stomach.  A
 right-sided central line ends in the right atrium.  A right-sided chest tube
 ends in the right apex.  Otherwise, there has been interval resolution of
 right-sided pneumothorax. Nearly complete opacification of both lungs is
 unchanged from recent radiograph.  Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Supporting devices as described above.
