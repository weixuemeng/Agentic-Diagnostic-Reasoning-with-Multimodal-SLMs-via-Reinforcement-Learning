                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post chest tube placement.  Evaluate for location
 of the chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube is noted, with the tip outside of the
 thoracic cage.  There is some subcutaneous emphysema along the right thoracic
 wall.  Otherwise, there is nearly complete opacification of both lungs.  A
 moderate pneumothorax is noted in the right.  Assessment of the heart could
 not be performed as the heart silhouette is obscured by pulmonary
 opacifications.  Mediastinal clips and sternotomy wires are sequela of a prior
 cardiothoracic surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Right-sided chest tube with the tip outside of the thoracic cage.
 
 3.  Nearly complete opacification of both lung fields may be related to edema,
 inflammation, hemorrhage or a combination of these.
