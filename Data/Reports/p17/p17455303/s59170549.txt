                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  The patient with fever and white count, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 The patient is status post extubation.  A right IJ terminates in the lower
 SVC.  An NG tube terminates in the body of the stomach with the sidehole at
 the gastroesophageal junction.  A left-sided abdominal drain is present.
 
 The right upper lobe atelectasis is improved.  Persistent left lower lobe
 opacity is present, with a small left pleural effusion.  The heart size is top
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent left lower lobe opacity, likely secondary to left lower lobe
 collapse but a developing consolidation cannot be excluded as there is no
 prominent mediastinal shift.  Small left pleural effusion.
 
 2. NG tube with sidehole at the GE junction, and may be advanced by 3-4 cm.
