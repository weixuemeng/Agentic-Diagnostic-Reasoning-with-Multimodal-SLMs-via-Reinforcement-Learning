                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for perforation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no convincing evidence
 of pneumoperitoneum.  There is a thin lucency along the medial aspect of the
 right hemidiaphragm that could represent a sliver of free air, though would
 also merely be a manifestation of an area of lung between the hemidiaphragm
 and atelectasis above it.
 
 This is not a true upright image.  If there is serious clinical concern for
 perforation, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
