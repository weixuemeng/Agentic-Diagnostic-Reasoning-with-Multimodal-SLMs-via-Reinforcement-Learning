                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest discomfort and desaturations.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest.  Right-sided pacemaker leads end in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is a right lower lung opacity, either right
 middle lobe or right lower lobe.  There is also a smaller left lower lobe
 opacity.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lung and left lower lobe opacities may represent
 atypical pneumonia. Alternatively, this can represent mild pulmonary edema or
 amiodarone toxicity.
