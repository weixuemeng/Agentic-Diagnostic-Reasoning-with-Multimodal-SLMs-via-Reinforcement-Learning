                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new diagnosed esophageal cancer, with
 question of aspiration, presenting with fever.  // Please evaluate for
 aspiration pneumonia/pulmonary process.     Please evaluate for aspiration
 pneumonia/pulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetry in the infrahilar lower lobes could be explained by recent
 aspiration on the right.  Repeat chest radiographs at full inspiration
 including oblique views would be helpful in comparing the lower lobes in
 multiple projections. Air in the upper esophagus is not a pathologic finding
 on the radiographs of most patients, but may reflect esophageal dysfunction in
 this patient.
 
 
 The small amount of left lateral costal pleural thickening is probably not due
 to pleural effusion, presumably a chronic finding.  Heart is normal size. 
 Hilar contours are generous but could be explained by normal vasculature. 
 There is no pulmonary edema or pulmonary engorgement.
