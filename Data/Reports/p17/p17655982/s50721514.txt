                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with urosepsis and right subdural hematoma. 
 Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. An enteric
 tube courses to the body of the stomach.  The AICD lead terminates in the
 right ventricle.  An additional catheter projects over the mid abdomen,
 incompletely evaluated.
 
 Dense left retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms is concerning for
 pneumonia, and less likely atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 noted.  No pneumothorax.  Left pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic arch is an incidental finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminates 5.2 cm above the carina.
 2. Probable left retrocardiac pneumonia, with a presumed left pleural
 effusion.
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
