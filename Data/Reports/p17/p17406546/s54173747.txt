                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mechanical fall, poor historian.  Assess for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: Limited study due to underpenetration. Low lung volumes are
 unchanged from prior exam with crowding of vasculature.  No overt pulmonary
 edema or pneumonia.  Pleural surfaces are normal without pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  No evidence of rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Subtle abnormalities are difficult
 to exclude on this study. 
 2.  No evidence of rib fracture, however, if clinical concern, consider
 dedicated rib series.
