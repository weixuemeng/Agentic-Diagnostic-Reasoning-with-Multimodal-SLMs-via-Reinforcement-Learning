                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Preoperative evaluation for left tibia and fibula fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  The aorta remains calcified and
 tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, with
 continued patchy opacities in the lung bases which are nonspecific. Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion. 
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure, slightly worse when compared to
 the most recent prior study, with trace right pleural effusion.  Left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities are nonspecific but may reflect atelectasis, or recurrent aspiration
 or infection.
