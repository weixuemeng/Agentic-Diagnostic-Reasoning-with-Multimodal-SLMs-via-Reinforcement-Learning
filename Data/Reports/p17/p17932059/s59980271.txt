 Since the previous chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube has been removed.  The
 tip of the right IJ line remains in the upper SVC.
 
 The left effusion appears somewhat smaller than it was on the prior film.  A
 moderate-sized right effusion is still present.  No evidence of underlying
 failure is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement, endotracheal tube removed.
