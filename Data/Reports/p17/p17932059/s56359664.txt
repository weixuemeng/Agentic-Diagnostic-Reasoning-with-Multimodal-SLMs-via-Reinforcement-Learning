                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff tube pulled back, eval Dobbhoff tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the
 patient in semi-upright position.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back with the tip projecting over the antrum
 of the stomach.  The distal portion of the tubing is sharply bent.  The lungs
 are fully expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar
 contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube with tip now projecting over the antrum of the
 stomach with a sharp angulation in the distal portion.  Please correlate with
 Dobbhoff function, and if there is resistance in flow, it should be partially
 withdawn to reduce angulation.
