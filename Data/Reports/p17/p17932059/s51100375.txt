                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a
 thoracentesis on the right with removal of a substantial amount of pleural
 fluid.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube appears to extend to the distal stomach, before turning back
 on itself with the tip in the lower body of the stomach pointing upward.
