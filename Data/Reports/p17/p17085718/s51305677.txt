                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to trauma CT torso performed the same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Retrocardiac opacification with faint air bronchograms may represent
 atelectasis versus aspiration in the setting of trauma with known T12 burst
 fracture.  No other pulmonary opacifications identified.  Known small
 pneumothorax identified on CT is not evident on radiograph.  No pleural
 effusion or displaced rib fractures identified.  Endotracheal tube and enteric
 catheter are well positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known small pneumothorax identified on CT is not evident on
 radiograph.  Retrocardiac opacification may represent atelectasis versus
 aspiration, new compared to same day CT.
