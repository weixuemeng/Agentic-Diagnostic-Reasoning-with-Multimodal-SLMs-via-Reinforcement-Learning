                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known small pneumothorax evaluate after positive pressure
 ventilation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT Torso performed same day.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours.  Compared to prior chest radiograph there are slightly
 lower lung volumes with a slighlty more conspicuous retrocardiac opacification
 is seen with faint bronchograms identified, new compared to recent CT and may
 represent developing atelectasis or aspiration in setting of known T12 burst
 fracture.  The small pneumothorax identified on CT is not identified on
 radiography, which is less sensitive.  No pleural effusion present. 
 Endotracheal tube and enteric tube well positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Known small pneumothorax identified on CT is not evident on radiograph. Lower
 lung volumes with slightly increased retrocardiac opacification, atelectasis
 versus aspiration in setting of trauma.
