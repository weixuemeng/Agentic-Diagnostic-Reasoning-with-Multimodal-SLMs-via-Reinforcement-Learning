                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypotension, assess progression of
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable view of the chest was provided.  There has been
 interval intubation with the ET tube tip positioned approximately 3.1 cm above
 the carina.  There is an NG tube which has been placed with its tip residing
 in the left upper abdomen.  No supine evidence for pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac
 consolidation is evidenced by air bronchograms.  Otherwise, the lungs are
 clear.  There has been no significant change in the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  The known osseous injuries involving the manubrium, right ribs,
 T1 and T12 are poorly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and endogastric tubes.  No
 definite pneumothorax seen on this supine portable radiograph.  Interval
 development of retrocardiac opacity which could be secondary to aspiration.
