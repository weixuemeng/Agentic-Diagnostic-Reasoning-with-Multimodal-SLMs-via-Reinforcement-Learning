                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with two months of chronic nonproductive cough.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild generalized increase in background density of the lungs and linear
 opacities could be due to change with aging over the past ___ years,
 particularly if the patient has asthma or is a smoker.  I doubt that this is
 an acute interstitial pneumonia.  Heart is normal size.  Pulmonary hila are
 unchanged, as is a pleural parenchymal nodularity at the right lung apex,
 probably scarring.  No evidence of central adenopathy.
