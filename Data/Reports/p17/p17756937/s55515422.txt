                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left chest tube with increased secretions and new NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two images were obtained to show the course of the NG tube which is
 with the tip either in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.  There is
 increased left pleural effusion, a component of which is loculated laterally. 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures are visualized.  There is left-sided
 subcutaneous emphysema similar in amount compared to prior.  There is left
 lower lobe volume loss.  The heart is mildly enlarged, and there is pulmonary
 vascular redistribution suggesting an element of fluid overload.
