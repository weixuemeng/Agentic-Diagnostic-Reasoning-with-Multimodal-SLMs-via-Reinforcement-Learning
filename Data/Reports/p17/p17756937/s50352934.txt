                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with polytrauma, now status post NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes,
 with an unchanged moderate-sized left pleural effusion.  A band of linear
 atelectasis is unchanged within the left lower lung.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains prominent, exaggerated by portable technique.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  Multiple comminuted displaced contiguous left-sided
 lateral rib fractures with adjacent marked pleural thickening are unchanged.
 
 An NG tube has been placed in the interim, the tip is seen within the proximal
 stomach, the side hole is not well appreciated but is likely within the distal
 esophagus.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval NG tube placement, the tip of which is in the proximal stomach,
 this could be advanced several centimeters to ensure that the sidehole is
 within the stomach.
 2.  Unchanged left pleural effusion and left pleural thickening with adjacent
 rib fractures and subcutaneous emphysema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed with ICU nurse ___ at 2pm.
