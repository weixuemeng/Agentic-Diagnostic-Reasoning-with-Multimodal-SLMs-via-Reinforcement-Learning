                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided pneumothorax, status
 post chest tube leak, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study of ___.  The patient has now
 been extubated and the previously identified ETT is not seen anymore.  Also, a
 previous detectable NG tube has been withdrawn.  Left-sided local pleural
 thickening along the axillary and lateral chest wall remains rather unchanged.
 The same holds for the multiple left-sided rib fractures which, however,
 cannot be identified in detail.  The subcutaneous chest wall emphysema has
 diminished, but remains visible in the left-sided lower neck area.  No other
 new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Moderate cardiac enlargement similar as
 before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of previously identified left lateral chest
 trauma with chest tube in place.  No new pneumothorax has developed.  Stable
 appearance of pleural densities.
