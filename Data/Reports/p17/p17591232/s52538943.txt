                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with recent cough, to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is no interval change or
 evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 some distortion of pulmonary vascular architecture and bullae are consistent
 with the clinical diagnosis of COPD.  However, there is no evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
