                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with HIV, COPD, with cough and coarse breath sounds, assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 There is an area of increased density in the medial base of the lingula,
 better appreciated on the lateral view.  The rest of the lungs are well
 expanded with no other focal consolidations.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Focal density in medial base of lingula, which could reflect
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
