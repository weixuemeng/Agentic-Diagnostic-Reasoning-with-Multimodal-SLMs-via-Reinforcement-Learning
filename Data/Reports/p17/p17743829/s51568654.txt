                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman treated for PNA ___, clinically improved  //
 assess for resolution of PNA      assess for resolution of PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.  Go
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lateral view best shows the multifocal right lower lobe pneumonia present on
 ___.  Comparing frontal and lateral views there has been substantial
 improvement, but some of the region of previous abnormality is obscured by
 calcification in the anterior right sixth rib.  The region is unchanged since
 ___, prior to the pneumonia.  I do not believe there is
 sufficient radiographic justification for further imaging or surveillance
 unless the patient has referable symptomatology.
 
 Top- normal heart size is unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal and
 there is no edema or pleural effusion.
