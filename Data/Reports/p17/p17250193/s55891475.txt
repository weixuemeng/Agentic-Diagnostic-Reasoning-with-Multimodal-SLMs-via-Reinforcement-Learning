                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fevers to 104.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  Much lower inspiratory effort is seen on the
 current exam.  Linear opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left,
 may be due to atelectasis, noting that consolidation cannot be completely
 excluded.  There is no effusion.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis,
 especially in the setting of lower lung volumes, however, component of
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  Please clinically correlate.  If
 necessary, repeat exam with better inspiratory effort can be attempted.
