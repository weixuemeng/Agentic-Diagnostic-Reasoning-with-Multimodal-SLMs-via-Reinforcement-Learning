                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of COPD who presents with
 abdominal pain and cough, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate clear lungs
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  There is hyperexpansion and flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms consistent with a diagnosis of COPD. Minimal bibasilar
 opacity may reflect minimal atelectasis.  The heart size is normal, the
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  A two lead left chest AICD is stable
 in appearance.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of cardiac
 decompensation.
