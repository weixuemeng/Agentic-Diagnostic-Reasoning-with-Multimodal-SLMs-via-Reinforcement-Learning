                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged.  The heart is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There
 are patchy linear opacities projecting over the left lower lung within the
 lingula suggesting minor atelectasis.  There is no evidence for pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild hyperinflation is suspected.  Small anterior
 osteophytes throughout the thoracic spine appear similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting minor left basilar atelectasis; otherwise
 unremarkable.
