  As compared to the prior radiograph, there is no significant change in the
  appearance of a right IJ central venous catheter ending in the right atrium or
  median sternotomy wires. There is a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax.
  Platelike atelectasis noted at the right mid lung. There are small bilateral
  pleural effusions. There is increased retrocardiac atelectasis.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with wires intact and properly
 aligned. Surgical clips projecting over the right scapula are unchanged. A
