  There is a new right chest tube with the tip at the apex. Other support lines
  and devices are unchanged. Note, the endotracheal tube continues to be
  somewhat low approximately 1.5 cm from the carina. Since the placement of the
  new right chest tube, there has been a significant decrease in size of the
  right pleural effusion. No definite pneumothorax. A subtle opacity near the
  right hilum in the midlung zone may represent some re-expansion edema.
  Continued attention on followup exam is recommended. Lungs are otherwise
  clear. Unchanged appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup of right sided hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina.  The Swan-Ganz
 catheter terminates at the right ventricular outflow tract.  A new right
 apical thoracostomy tube is present.  A right basilar chest tube is unchanged
 in position.  Orogastric tube and left thoracostomy tube are unchanged in
 orientation.  The patient is post CABG.  A loculated right pleural effusion
 has markedly decreased in size.  There is no pneumothorax.  The central right
 perihilar opacity may reflect focal edema versus consolidation.  Short-term
 followup radiograph recommended.
