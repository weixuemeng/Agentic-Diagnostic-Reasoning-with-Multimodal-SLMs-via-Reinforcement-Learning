 WET READ: ___ ___ 1:08 AM
  Increased mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Heterogeneous opacities in the
  right mid/lower lung zones could be explained by asymmetric edema however
  superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ 1:00 AM
  Heterogeneous bilateral opacities most prominently in the left mid/lower lung
  zones could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ 1:05 AM
  Heterogeneous bilateral opacities most prominently in the left mid/lower lung
  zones could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context. Increased
  mild pulmonary interstitial edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of intravenous
 drug use with crackles at the right base.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is stable.  There is interval development
 of diffuse interstitial linear opacities with central, perihilar distribution,
 consistent with pulmonary interstitial edema.  The left mid and lower lung are
 slightly more involved, that may explain slightly asymmetric nature of the
 edema, but superimposed left mid and lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.
