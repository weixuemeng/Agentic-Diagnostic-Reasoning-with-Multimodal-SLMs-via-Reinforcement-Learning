                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoxia, sob  // ?pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   This patient is known to have severe
 emphysema which accounts for the hyperinflation and lucent appearing lungs.
 There are clips projecting over the right breast with asymmetric breast size
 likely reflecting prior partial right lumpectomy. An area of scarring in the
 right upper lung is stable and better assessed on the prior ct chest from ___. No convincing signs of pneumonia or overt CHF. Subtle
 prominence of the left pulmonary hilar bronchovasculature may be related to AP
 portable technique. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD/emphysema with stable scarring in the right upper lung. No convincing
 signs of pneumonia or overt CHF.
