                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weight loss with significant tobacco use.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again
 hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent
 with chronic pulmonary disease.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal in size, and there is tortuosity of the aorta.  Some prominence of
 interstitial markings could reflect chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure, or both.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
