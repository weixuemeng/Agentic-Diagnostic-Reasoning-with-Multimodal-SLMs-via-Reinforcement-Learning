                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Lungs are hyperinflated
 with flattening of the diaphragms and emphysematous changes most pronounced in
 the apices.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.  Patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities are relatively unchanged compared to the prior study, and likely
 reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears
 unchanged, and is most likely due to chronic pleural thickening.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Emphysema.
