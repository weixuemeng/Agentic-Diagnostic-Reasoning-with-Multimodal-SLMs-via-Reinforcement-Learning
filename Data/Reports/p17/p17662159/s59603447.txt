                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for one week.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms,
 most consistent with emphysema.  Basilar linear opacities are not
 significantly changed from the prior exam, likely representing chronic
 atelectasis.  There is no new consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is pleural thickening at the bases and
 apices.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Again, the aorta is
 tortuous and diffusely calcified.  The heart is minimally enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable emphysema and basilar opacities, which are likely
 atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
