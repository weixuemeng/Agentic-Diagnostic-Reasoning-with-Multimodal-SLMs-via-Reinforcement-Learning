                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Confusion, COPD, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency, likely reflective of underlying
 emphysema.  Linear opacities in the lower lungs likely represent scarring.  No
 large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD without superimposed pneumonia.
