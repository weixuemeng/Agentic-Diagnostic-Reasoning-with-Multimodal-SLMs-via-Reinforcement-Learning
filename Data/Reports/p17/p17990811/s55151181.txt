 present. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Prominence of the hila may be
 due to pulmonary vascular engorgement although hilar adenopathy is not
 excluded.  Left base opacity may be due to atelectasis and there is shift of
 the mediastinum to the left however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
 Micronodular opacities are again seen scattered throughout the lungs. 
 Persistent right upper lung opacity is seen
