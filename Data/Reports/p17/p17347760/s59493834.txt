                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old female with CHF (EF ___%), CAD (s/p stent in  ___ at
 ___), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and Alzheimer's Dementia who presents
 as a transfer from ___ with worsening dyspnea, fatigue, and lower
 extremity swelling, hypotension and bradycardia found to have a unilateral
 effusion with concern for malignancy.  // reaccumulation of effusion?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 14:10.  ___ at 10:08
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with ___, retrocardiac opacity with may have increased
 slightly, consistent with increased left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is also slight blunting of left costophrenic angle which
 is more pronounced and could reflect an accumulating small left pleural
 effusion.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to the
 prior study.  There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. 
 Previously seen vascular plethora is slightly improved.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 Known left-sided rib fractures are not well visualized sclerotic density
 overlying the T12 or L1 vertebral body could reflect prior vertebroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight worsening of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Suspected
 small left effusion may be slightly larger.  No gross effusion.
 
 Interval improvement in CHF findings, now with upper zone redistribution, but
 improved vascular plethora.
 
 Small right pleural effusion is similar to prior.
