                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fevers, rigors, cough, confusion, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Elevated left
 hemidiaphragm with chronic consolidation in the left lower lobe is again
 noted.  Possibility of a small superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to
 exclude.  The right lung appears clear.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No definite
 pleural effusion.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with lower lobe
 chronic consolidation.  Difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia in the
 left lower lobe.  Please correlate clinically.
