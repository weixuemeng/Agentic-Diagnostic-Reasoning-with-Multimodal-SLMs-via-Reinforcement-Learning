                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with left hand swelling.  Evaluate possible hilar
 adenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Severe elevation of left hemidiaphragm is longstanding, and function of the
 left hemidiaphragm is suspect.  This produces moderately severe atelectasis at
 the base of the left lung.  Volume in the right hemithorax is small, partially
 reduced by rightward shift of the mediastinum.  Right lung is grossly clear. 
 Large central lymph node calcifications are stable.  Heart size is
 indeterminate, obscured by elevated left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax or
 recurrent pleural effusion.
