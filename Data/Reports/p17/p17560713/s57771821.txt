                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cardiac arrest  // assess ETT
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ under MRN ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated with respect to the film. Endotracheal tube terminates
 4.5 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is similar to prior with left base atelectasis.
 Increased consolidation of the left base could represent volume loss,
 aspiration, or infection. Large calcified right hilar node is unchanged.
 Rightward shift of the mediastinum is accentuated by patient positioning.
 Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to prior. There is a large amount of gas
 within the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 2. Large amount of gas within stomach.
 
 3. Increased left base opacity is in part long-standing and related to volume
 loss, but superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
