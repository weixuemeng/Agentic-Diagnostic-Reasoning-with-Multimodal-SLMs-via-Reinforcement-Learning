                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New weakness and fatigue.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases
 likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine with anterior bridging osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  No radiographic evidence for cardiomegaly or pneumonia.
