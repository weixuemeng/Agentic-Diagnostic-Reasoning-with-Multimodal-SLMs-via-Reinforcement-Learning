                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malaise.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a three-lead pacemaker/ICD device that appears unchanged. 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left ventricular
 configuration.  The lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Similar to prior findings, there is mild interstitial
 prominence suggesting vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear
 probably demineralized with degenerative changes throughout the mid-to-lower
 thoracic and visualized upper lumbar spines.  A lower thoracic compression
 deformity of a moderate loss in height appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion but similar to prior
 findings.
