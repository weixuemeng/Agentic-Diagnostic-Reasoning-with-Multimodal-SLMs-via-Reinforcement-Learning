                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Triple lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads unchanged in
 position.  There are low lung volumes.  The AICD battery pack obscures the low
 lateral upper hemithorax in the frontal view.  Mild blunting of the posterior
 bilateral costophrenic angles is consistent with trace of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Trace bilateral pleural effusions and possible minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Persistent cardiomegaly.
