                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ___'s status post fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium,
 right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 re- demonstrated.  The aorta is diffusely calcified.  Widening of the
 mediastinum superiorly is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, which may be accentuated by supine positioning, low lung volumes
 and AP technique.  Low lung volumes are noted.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is otherwise demonstrated.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar
 patchy opacities which may reflect atelectasis.  Infection or aspiration
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
