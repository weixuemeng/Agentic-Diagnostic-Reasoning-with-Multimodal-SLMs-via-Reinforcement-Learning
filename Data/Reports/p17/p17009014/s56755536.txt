                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with several days of cough, ?aspiration.  Assess for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mildly hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis and crowding of
 vasculature.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a focal 1 cm
 nodular opacity projecting over the posterior right fifth rib at the lung
 apex.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal contour and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Left-sided pacer device is again seen along the left anterior chest wall with
 3 intact leads, unchanged since prior examination.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for orthopedic
 hardware in the proximal left humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and crowding of vasculature.
 3.  Right apical 1 cm nodular opacity for which dedicated, nonurgent chest CT
 is suggested.
