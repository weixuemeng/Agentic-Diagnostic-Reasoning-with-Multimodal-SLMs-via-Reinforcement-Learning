                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubated  // tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to reference chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation, and the endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4.8 cm above the level of the carina. Additionally, there has
 been interval progression of diffuse bilateral airspace opacities which may
 represent multifocal pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute
 osseous abnormalities are detected.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over
 the right axilla and epigastrium.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube terminating 4.8 cm above the carinal.
 2.  Diffuse, bilateral airspace opacities are suggestive of a widespread
 infectious etiology or less likely pulmonary edema.
