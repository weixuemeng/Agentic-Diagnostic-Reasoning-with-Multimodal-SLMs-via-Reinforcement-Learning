                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stroke, needs cxr per neuro
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is demonstrated. Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with streaky bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
