                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, CTA chest from ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Aorta is tortuous and
 generally large, but not clearly aneurysmal or changed over more than ___
 years. An aorta with this appearance is prone to dissection which might not be
 diagnosable on conventional chest radiographs. The lungs are well expanded and
 clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel anterior
 osteophytes in the thoracolumbar spine, with severe loss of disc height in the
 visualized upper lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. Aortic
 dissection is not excluded by this radiographic appearance and should be
 considered in clinical context.
