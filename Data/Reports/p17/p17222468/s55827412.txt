                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  COPD with lung cancer status post partial right lung resection.
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates stable postsurgical changes
 related to prior right upper lobectomy with persistent right apical pleural
 fluid and slight rightwards mediastinal shift due to volume loss. The trachea
 is deviated the right .  The hila are also retracted up or. Asymmetric
 appearance of anterior right ribs may also be postsurgical.
 
 Heterogeneous opacity inferior to the left hilum is noted. There is blunting
 of both costophrenic angles, which is new compared with ___. No
 gross pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The heart is not enlarged..
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. Fixation hardware noted overlying the
 lower cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Background COPD and postoperative changes. No frank consolidation.
 Heterogeneous infrahilar opacity may represent scarring however differential
 includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Recommend followup
 chest radiograph in 6 weeks once clinically stable to assess for interval
 resolution.
