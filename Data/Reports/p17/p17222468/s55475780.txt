                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy, assess
 for interval change in pneumothorax, edema, effusion and consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position.  A moderate
 right-sided pneumothorax is unchanged in size, but there is new extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema throughout the right chest wall.  The nodular opacity
 which was seen previously at the right lung apex is not as well visualized;
 however, there is progression of pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse
 opacity throughout the partially atelectatic right lung which may partially
 obscure the margins.  Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged with no left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Osseous structures appear unchanged.  Multiple calcified
 granulomas are again seen throughout the left lung. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable size of a moderate right-sided pneumothorax, but new
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.  Progression of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.
