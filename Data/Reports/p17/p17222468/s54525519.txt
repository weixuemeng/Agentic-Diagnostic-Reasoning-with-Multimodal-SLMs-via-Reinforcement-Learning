                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Non-small cell lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy,
 presenting with acute-onset left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post right upper lobectomy with redemonstration
 of associated volume loss and rightward mediastinal shift, slightly more
 prominent compared to prior exam due to additional volume loss from interval
 improvement of a right apical loculated effusion, now small in size.  Heart
 size is normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without focal consolidations.  There is no pneumothorax.  Anterior
 cervical fixation hardware is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Changes from right upper lobectomy with associated volume loss
 and rightward mediastinal shift with interval improvement of a loculated right
 apical pleural effusion and resolution of right lung field opacities.  These
 findings neither suggest nor exclude pulmonary embolus.
