 cancer, ? interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  Heart is normal

 vascular markings likely suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement and fluid
 overload.  Low volume lungs are clear bilaterally.  No significant pleural
 effusions.  Right apical pneumothorax is stable.  Extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema is again noted within the right lateral chest wall and right neck. 
 There is interval removal of the right-sided chest tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 Stable right apical pneumothorax.  No significant changes compared to the
 prior radiograph.
