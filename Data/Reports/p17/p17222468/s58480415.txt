                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy, presenting
 with right-sided chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior chest radiographs are available from ___.  CT
 imaging is available from ___.  PET-CT imaging from ___ and recent thoracic spine radiographs from ___ are also
 available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There are streaky new posterior basilar opacities, probably in the right lower
 lobe and suggestive of minor atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear
 aside from scattered unchanged small calcified granulomas.  The bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky new posterior right lower lobe opacities.  Although an
 infectious process is difficult to completely exclude, the appearance would be
 compatible with atelectasis.  Correlation with clinical findings is suggested.
 If symptoms were to persist, then follow-up radiographs might be appropriate.
