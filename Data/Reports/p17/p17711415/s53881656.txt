                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with myeloma and new right rib pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 I do not see any marker localizing the site of right rib pain.  Subject to the
 technical limitations of chest radiographs in detecting bone lesions and the
 absence of any localization, I can say I do not see any chest cage
 abnormalities.  Detailed views of areas of focal findings should be requested.
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces.
 
 Lateral view shows mild kyphosis and some wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral
 body present since at least ___, following chest CT findings in
 ___ of likely extensive myeloma in the spine.
