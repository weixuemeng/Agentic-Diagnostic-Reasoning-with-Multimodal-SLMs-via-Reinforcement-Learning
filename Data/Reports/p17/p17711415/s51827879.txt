                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new hypoxia  // ?PNA vs pulmonary edema     
 ?PNA vs pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the base.  There has been the
 development of an area of the opacification and just above the right
 hemidiaphragm. It is unclear whether this represents a dense streak of
 atelectasis. A region of developing pneumonia, or possibly merely an artifact.
 A repeat study without obliquity of the patient is recommended.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr.  ___.
