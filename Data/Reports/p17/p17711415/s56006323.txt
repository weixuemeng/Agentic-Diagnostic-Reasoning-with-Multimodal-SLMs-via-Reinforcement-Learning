                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, on chemoradiation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___ and MR of the thoracic spine
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A mild
 interstitial abnormality with peribronchial cuffing suggests mild pulmonary
 edema.  There is a mild compression deformity along the lower thoracic spine
 and another along the mid thoracic spine.  These are concordant with prior
 thoracic MR findings without any increased loss in vertebral body height.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary edema, although other
 differential considerations include atypical pneumonia.
 
 2.  Stable loss in height among two lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
