                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of myeloma.  Chest pain.  Evaluate for pleural effusion
 or bone lesions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The pulmonary vessels appear somewhat more distinct and narrower. 
 Accompanied by a small decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette, this is
 consistent with slight improvement in vascular congestion.  The mediastinal
 contour is unchanged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The
 aorta is somewhat tortuous, but unchanged.  There are no focal airspace
 opacities to suggest pneumonia.  The bones are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Within the limitations of a chest radiograph, no skeletal lesions are
 identified.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to ___, NP
