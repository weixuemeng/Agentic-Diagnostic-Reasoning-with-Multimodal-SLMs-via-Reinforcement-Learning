                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The
 mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  A somewhat peripheral opacity projecting over the left
 lateral lung base may be due to overlying soft tissue.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Streaky opacities in the lung lower lungs likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is minimal
 scarring within the lung apices.  No acute osseous abnormalities are otherwise
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Peripheral opacity within the left lung
 base may reflect overlying soft tissue; comparison with prior radiographs may
 be helpful, or a short term follow up exam can be obtained for further
 evaluation.
