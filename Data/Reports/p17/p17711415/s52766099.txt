 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Skeletal
 structures are remarkable for a compression deformity in the upper thoracic
 spine as well as an expansile lesion at the level of the left sixth anterior
 rib, similar in appearance to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
