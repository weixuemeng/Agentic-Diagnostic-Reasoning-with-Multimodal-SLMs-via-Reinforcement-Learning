                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ study.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by improvement in extent of interstitial edema. 
 Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has apparently slightly decreased in
 size, and a small left pleural effusion is similar.  Left retrocardiac
 atelectasis has worsened, however.
