 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:55 PM
  Low lung volumes and bibasilar opacities worsened from ___ represent
  increased atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded given the
  patient's clinical history. Wetread placed in CCC by ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML, neutropenic, new fever.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Report from ___ chest CT refers to a left lower ___ pneumonia that had
 improved since the prior exam, new ground-glass opacities in the right lower
 ___, ___ micronodules, and scattered sclerotic bone lesions.  Please see
 full report from that study.  
 
 Compared with the radiograph from ___, the bibasilar opacities are
 somewhat denser and more confluent.  The differential diagnosis includes both
 atelectasis and infectious infiltrate.  No gross effusion, though a small
 amount of pleural fluid could be present on either side.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  The upper and mid zones of both lungs are
 grossly clear.  
 
 A right-sided PICC line is again noted with tip near SVC/RA junction.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 A small sclerotic density is again noted in the left humeral head, nonspecific
 in appearance.  Mild degenerative changes of both AC joints are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar patchy, slightly more pronounced than on ___, but
 seeen in the setting of slightly lower lung volumes, ? atelectasis versus
 pneumonia.
