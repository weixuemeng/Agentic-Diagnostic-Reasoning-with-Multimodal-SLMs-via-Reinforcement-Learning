                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right upper lobe mass, now with fever and shortness of breath, to
 assess for volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Bibasilar opacifications are most consistent with atelectasis.  However, in
 the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  There is also an area of ill-defined
 opacification in the right upper zone, which could reflect an area of
 pneumonia.
 
 The right lower hemithorax opacification is again consistent with a chest wall
 lipoma.
