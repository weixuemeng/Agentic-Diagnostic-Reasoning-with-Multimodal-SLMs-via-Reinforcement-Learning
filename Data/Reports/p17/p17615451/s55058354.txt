                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and right PICC
 is in standard position in the superior vena cava.  Patchy and linear
 bibasilar opacities have slightly improved and most likely represent
 atelectasis.  No new areas of consolidation are identified, but standard PA
 and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of
 the lungs when the patient's condition allows.
