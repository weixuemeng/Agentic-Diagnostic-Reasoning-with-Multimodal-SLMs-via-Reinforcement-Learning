                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question migrated PICC line.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A PICC line is present.  The tip overlies the distal SVC and may have
 retracted very slightly (~12 mm).  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Mild prominence of upper zone
 vessels likely relates to low inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy opacity at
 both bases, but improved at the left base, compared with ___ at 17:31
 p.m.. Focal opacity seen at the edge of the right sixth rib anteriorly may
 represent confluence of osseous and soft tissue shadows.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PICC line tip overlies distal SVC and may have retracted
 approximately 12 mm, compared with the earlier film.
