                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with lung opacity on prior chest
 examination, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison can be made with
 the next preceding portable single view chest examination of ___. 
 During the interval, the patient has been extubated.  The previously described
 right-sided permanent pacer connected to dual intracavitary electrode system
 remains in unchanged position.  There is cardiac enlargement with a
 configuration suggesting left ventricular prominence, a finding which in aorta
 shows calcium deposits in the wall, both at the conjunction with the generally
 widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests systemic hypertension.  The
 level of the arch as well as in the descending area.  Local contour
 abnormalities are not identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid
 accumulation.  No acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and the on previous
 portable examination suspected left lower lobe atelectasis has resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extubated, significant cardiac enlargement but no evidence of
 pleural effusion, acute pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates.
