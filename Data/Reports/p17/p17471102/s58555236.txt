  ET in lower trachea, could consider slight retraction; balloon may be
  overinflated; NGT in stomach but could be advanced somewhat for better
  purchase.  Non-specific retrocardiac opacity; attention in follow-up
  suggested.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.  Patient with intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post endotracheal intubation.  The tube is
 somewhat low lying, with the tip terminating only about 1-1.5 cm above the
 carina.  In addition, the balloon appears somewhat over-inflated.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach although with relatively little
 purchase.  Its sidehole lies only slightly below the gastroesophageal
 junction.  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place.  The heart is
 at upper limits of normal size.  The aorta shows mild-to-moderate unfolding
 and patchy calcification.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left
 hemidiaphragm which could be seen with substantial atelectasis, perhaps with a
 pleural effusion; however, infectious causes are difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Somewhat low lying endotracheal tube and generously inflated cuff.  Slight
 retraction of the tube and if feasible decreased distention of the balloon may
 be appropriate if clinically indicated.
 
 2.  Nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach, although if better purchase
 in the stomach is desired clinically then the tube could be advanced.
 
 3.  Left lower lung opacity, which is nonspecific but could be seen with
 atelectasis and perhaps pleural effusion although pneumonia or aspiration are
 difficult to completely exclude.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 appropriate to reassess.
