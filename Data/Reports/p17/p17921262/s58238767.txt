                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest and back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 Lung volumes are low. The lateral view is degraded by respiratory motion. The
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are wthin normal limits for technique.No
 chf, gross consolidation, effusion, or ptx detected.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities are noted.   Given blurring due to respiratory motion, a subtle
 lower lobe infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.   Assessment of the
 t-spine is also limited due to motion.  There are mild multilevel degenerative
 changes. Minimal anterior wedging of T12 and ? T10 noted, but this is
 probablyunchanged compared with ___..
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No definite infiltrate identified.  Please see
 comment above.
