 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent pneumonia, followup after
 treatment.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size and thoracic aorta unchanged. 
 No pulmonary vascular congestion has developed.  The, on previous examination,
 demonstrated mixed chronic and acute infiltrates have undergone some
 regression suggesting that the acute component has been treated successfully. 
 The remaining mostly linear densities in retrocardiac position on the left
 base are compared with the next preceding chest examination of ___.
 The left-sided basal changes appear to be similar as encountered in ___

 patient have advanced chronic repetitive pulmonary problems, consider
 evaluation of these chronic changes with chest CT.
