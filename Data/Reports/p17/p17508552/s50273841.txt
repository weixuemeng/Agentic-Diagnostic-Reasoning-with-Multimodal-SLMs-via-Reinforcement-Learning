                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with atypical pneumonia, question
 improvement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There are scattered patchy opacities at both lung bases as well as in the
 right upper lobe abutting the horizontal fissure, and possibly within the
 lingula. These findings do not appear to be significantly changed given
 differences in technique and patient positioning.  These would be compatible
 with multifocal pneumonia.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain within
 normal limits.  No pneumothorax.
