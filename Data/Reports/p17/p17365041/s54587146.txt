 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 similar. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are likely present. Subsegmental atelectasis is noted in the left
 lung base. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. There are
 minimal degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.  Increased opacity
 projecting over the left posteolateral seventh rib is unchanged, and likely
 related to underlying metastasis.
