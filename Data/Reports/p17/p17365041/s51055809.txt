                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with weakness  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  Bone scan from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Linear opacity at the left lung base suggestive of atelectasis versus
 scarring. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 similar in configuration. Increased opacity projecting over the posterolateral
 left seventh rib with lack of inferior cortical margin.  This is in similar
 region to abnormal uptake on recent bone scan and is likely related to
 underlying metastasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
