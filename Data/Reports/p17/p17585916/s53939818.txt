 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 06:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:29 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Somewhat limited examination due to patient positioning. Patient's mandible
 obscures the apices. Lung volumes remain dramatically diminished and the right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated. Visualized lungs demonstrate streaky
 opacities, predominantly at the right base suggestive of atelectasis. Left
 axillary pacemaker is again seen but no definite lead is identified. No
 evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot
 be assessed due to patient positioning.
