                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trauma, possible aspiration before intubated
 // Please eval interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph.  ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Poor positioning of the head obscures the right upper lung field. Heart size
 is top-normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  A right pleural
 effusion is significantly increased in size compared to the prior exam. Lung
 volumes are improved with bibasilar atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm is
 markedly elevated. ETT appears low, terminating near the level of the carina,
 but the head is also down, which causes caudal migration of ETT. An enteric
 tube is noted with tip terminating in the stomach. A left axillary pacemaker
 is noted, but the pacemaker lead tip is not definitely visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam given poor head position. No definite evidence of aspiration.
 Increased right pleural effusion.
