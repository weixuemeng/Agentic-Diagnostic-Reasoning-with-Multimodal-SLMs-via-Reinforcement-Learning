 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs most recent on ___ at
 09:31.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right pneumothorax is again seen and largely unchanged in size.  Again seen
 is atelectasis and pleural effusion at the right base, which appears largely
 unchanged but is difficult to compare due to differences in patient
 positioning.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.
