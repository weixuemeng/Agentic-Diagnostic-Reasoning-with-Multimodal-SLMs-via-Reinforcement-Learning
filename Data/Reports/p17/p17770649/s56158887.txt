                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There has been interval
 progression of the right basilar consolidation which now completely
 silhouettes the hemidiaphragm.  This is likely due to a combination of pleural
 effusion with underlying consolidation in the right lower and middle lobes. 
 The left lung and right upper lung are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to assess given silhouetting on the right.  No visualized acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of the right lung base opacity components of
 effusion and underlying consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes. 
 Given persistence of these findings, CT scan should be considered to further
 assess.
