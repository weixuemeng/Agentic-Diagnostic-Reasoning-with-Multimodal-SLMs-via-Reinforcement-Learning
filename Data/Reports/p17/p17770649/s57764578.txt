                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, evaluation for pneumothorax at right
 lung base.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 pneumothorax has substantially increased in severity.  The pneumothorax is not
 seen in both the apical and the basal regions of the right hemithorax.  In
 addition, the lateral radiograph shows a relatively extensive right basal
 air-fluid level.  The lateral radiograph also depicts the relatively
 substantial pneumothorax.  There is atelectasis at the right lung base. 
 Although no signs of tension are visible, close radiographic monitoring must
 be performed and, if indicated, drainage of the pneumothorax should be
 considered.
