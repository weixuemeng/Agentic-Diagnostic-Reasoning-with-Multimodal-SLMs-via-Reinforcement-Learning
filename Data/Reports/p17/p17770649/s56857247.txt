 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:21
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone left
 thoracocentesis. The left effusion has substantially decreased in extent and
 is now 0 limited to the level of the left costophrenic sinus on both the
 frontal and the lateral chest radiograph. There is a small degree of
 re-expansion edema, causing a subtle parenchymal opacity, better appreciated
 on the lateral than on the frontal film.  No evidence of postprocedural
 pneumothorax. The appearance of the heart and of the right hemithorax is
 constant.
