                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, SOB.  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Crowding of bronchovascular
 markings at the right medial lung base noted limiting the evaluation for a
 subtle pneumonia at this site.  Otherwise the lungs are clear.  Heart size is
 normal and stable.  Prominence of the mediastinum is again noted though the
 contours appear well defined.  The stability of this appearance over multiple
 prior imaging studies suggests a benign etiology, i.e. mediastinal
 lipomatosis.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence for pneumonia.  Difficult to exclude an early pneumonia
 in the right medial lung base.
 Mild prominence of the mediastinum over multiple prior chest radiographs
 likely reflect prominent mediastinal fat.
