 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pelvic abscess drainage, now sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  Relatively extensive bilateral basal
 opacities, with the morphology suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  This is
 supported by bilateral perihilar haze, peribronchial cuffing and a
 questionable small right pleural effusion.  Mild cardiomegaly.  No
 pneumothorax.
