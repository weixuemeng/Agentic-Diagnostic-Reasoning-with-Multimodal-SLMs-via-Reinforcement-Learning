                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pulmonary edema and free air in patient with
 tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Several chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  The right-sided line has been removed.  The distribution of a
 small right pleural effusion has changed; however, the amount of pleural fluid
 is relatively similar. There has been a slight interval increase in the small
 left pleural effusion and an increase in moderate bibasilar atelectasis. There
 is vascular prominence and vascular venous engorgement.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased moderate bibasilar atelectasis is most likely due to atelecasis
 but underlying pneumonia is possible. 
 
 2.  Slight increase in small left pleural effusion. Unchanged small right
 pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Increased vascular prominence and venous engorgement indicate increased
 circulating blood volume.
