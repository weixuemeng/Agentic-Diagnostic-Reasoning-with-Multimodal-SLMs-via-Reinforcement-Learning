                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea since ___.  Unremarkable echo.  Is
 there any pulmonary abnormality?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging.  Lung volumes are low, but no focal pulmonary abnormality is present.
 I do not see evidence of pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours and pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
 Trachea is mildly enlarged, but probably not pathologic.
