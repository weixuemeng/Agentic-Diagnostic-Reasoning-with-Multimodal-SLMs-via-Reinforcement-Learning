                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage III ovarian CA with recurrence, low-grade temps, nausea,
 vomiting, and diarrhea.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with background COPD.  There is
 moderately-severe cardiomegaly, including very pronounced enlargement of the
 right heart.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is overall similar to ___.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.  There are
 small bilateral effusions.  The lateral view raises the question of some
 patchy opacity in the lower lobe.  Although the frontal view shows some patchy
 opacity at both bases, similar to prior film, the appearance on the lower lobe
 is suggestive of a focal pneumonic infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The possibility of a lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 2.  Small bilateral effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  COPD, unchanged.
 4.  Cardiomegaly, including very pronounced right heart enlargement,
 unchanged.
 5.  Bilateral C7 cervical ribs incidentally noted, not fully evaluated,
 unchanged.
 6.  Targeted review of a torso CT from ___ dated ___ showed
 bilateral effusions, with only minimal atelectasis at both bases, and no focal
 infiltrate that would correspond to the finding on today's radiograph.
