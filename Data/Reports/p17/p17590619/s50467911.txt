                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotic bowel, infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 23:56 p.m.
 
 An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm to overlie the left
 upper quadrant near the expected site of the stomach. The NG tube sideport now
 appears to overlie the upper stomach. No free air is detected beneath the
 diaphragms.  Some residual contrast is again noted in a decompressed loop of
 small bowel in the left upper quadrant.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse interstitial edema, probably
 with some confluent areas of alveolar edema.  This is considerably more
 pronounced than on the film obtained one day earlier.  Hazy opacity throughout
 much of the right lung could reflect a layering effusion.  Left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation has progressed compared with the prior film.  No
 gross left effusion is identified.  There is increased opacity in the expected
 location of the azygos vein, which could reflect some right heart failure. 
 Ill-definition of the aortic knob and hila probably reflects the CHF.  The
 cardiac silhouette ___ are otherwise similar to prior, with prominence
 of the right heart border again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Considerable worsening of CHF findings compared with the film from
 yesterday evening, with interstitial and probably with some alveolar edema and
 suspected layering right effusion.
 
 2.  Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 3.  Poor visualization of the azygos vein raises the question of a component
 of right heart failure in this patient with enlarged right heart border. 
 Clinical correlation requested.
