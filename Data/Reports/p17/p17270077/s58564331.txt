                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Concern for PE.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 17:30 p.m., no gross change is identified. 
 
 Again seen is background COPD, cardiomegaly, prominence of the hila suggesting
 pulmonary hypertension, increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, minimal linear atelectasis at the
 left base, and mild patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region -- ?
 atelectasis or focal infiltrate.  There is minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles, which is slightly more pronounced.   There is mild upper
 zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Compared with ___,
 there has beenslight change in the configuration of the right hilum, which
 appears more nodular and less tapered on the current examination -- this is of
 uncertain significance, ? due to differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged compared with one day earlier, except for
 possible small bilateral effusions.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and minimal patchy opacity right base.  Mild upper zone
 redistribution.  Evidence of pulmonary hypertension with equivocal interval
 change in configuration of right hilum.
