                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxia, pulmonary edema, Dobbhoff tube placement. 
 Please evaluate Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 Dobbhoff tube with tip obscured from view but well below diaphragm.  Of note,
 the DHT appears to still have wire in place.  In addition, there is likely
 coiling of the tube in the pharynx.  After confirming with team placing
 Dobbhoff, the tube was fixed to the patient's cheek at the time of x-ray and
 thus not draped across the neck.  There is stable left PICC line with tip in
 the mid SVC.  Otherwise, there is a minimal improvement of the pulmonary edema
 with a stable small left pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly
 present.  Normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube with tip in stomach with wire still in place is
 likely coiled in the pharynx.  Per primary team, this tubing was not
 overlapping outside patient's neck at time of radiograph.  Recommend
 repositioning.
 
 ___ discussed these findings with Dr. ___ at 2:30 p.m.
 on ___ via telephone.
