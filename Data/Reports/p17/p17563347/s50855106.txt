                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 13:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate line placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11 a.m.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 13:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right internal jugular line now has its tip in the mid SVC.  A right
 basilar chest tube and mediastinal drains remain in place.  There has been
 some interval improvement in aeration at the left lung base where there is
 still residual patchy opacity and a layering effusion favoring compressive
 atelectasis.  Patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis and
 is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Relatively low lung volumes with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal
 contours status post median sternotomy.  Sutural material in the left humeral
 head is consistent with prior rotator cuff tear.  A 1 cm calcified opacity is
 seen in the right acromiohumeral space, possibly representing a loose body.
