                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M POD___ s/p aortic arch replacement, increasing O2 requirement 
 // compare to prior
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large-bore right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared the prior study with persistent left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  There has been an increase in the extent of the right mid
 lung airspace opacity, while this may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema
 appearances are concerning for infection.  Persistent enlargement of the
 mediastinum with previous median sternotomy noted.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased airspace opacity in the right mid lung may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema however the appearances are concerning for infection.
