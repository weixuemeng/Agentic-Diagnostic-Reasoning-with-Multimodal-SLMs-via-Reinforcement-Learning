 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:19 PM
  A erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
  endotracheal tube.  A chest tube projects over the midline.  Sternotomy wires
  appear intact.  Mediastinal widening is unchanged.  A right internal jugular
  catheter is in unchanged position.  There is been removal of Swan-Ganz
  catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Opacities bilaterally, left greater
  than right, persist.  Likely small left pleural effusion is present.  Improved
  aeration of the right lower lung zone is noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p type A dissection repair and CT removal-Still
 has left pleural  // r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube.  Lung volumes are
 grossly unchanged.  Knee chest tube projects over the mediastinum. A right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  The Swan-Ganz
 catheter has been removed.  There is persistent widening of the mediastinum,
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  Slight interval improvement in the
 right pleural effusion.  Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.  There are
 bilateral airspace opacities in the mid lungs which may reflect pulmonary
 edema versus infection.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in the right basal pleural effusion.
 2. New bilateral airspace opacities likely reflect pulmonary edema, infection
 cannot be excluded.
