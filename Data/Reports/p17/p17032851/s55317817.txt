                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aortic dissection  // s/p ct d/c, r/o ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  There is
 persistent visualization of multifocal parenchymal opacities, most confluent
 in the right mid lung but also affecting the left midlung.  There is
 persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.  Although difficult to localize, I
 suspect there is a small amount of air in the mediastinum.  Small left pleural
 effusion.
