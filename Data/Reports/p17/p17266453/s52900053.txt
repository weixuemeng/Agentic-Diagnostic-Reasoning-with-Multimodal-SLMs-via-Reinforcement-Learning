                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M pmh DM, morbid obesity now s/p LLE debridement. sepsis. 
 // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 5.3 cm above the carina. 
 A nasogastric tube is been placed, terminating below the diaphragm. 
 Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal
 interstitial edema.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for subsegmental atelectasis
 in the left lower lobe.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is potentially
 due to mediastinal lipomatosis accentuated by vascular engorgement.  Standard
 PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful prior to discharge for more
 complete assessment of the mediastinum.
