 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:54 PM
  Suboptimal exam due to patient motion.  Interval placement of left-sided
  jugular central venous catheter, distal portion not well seen but possibly
  terminating just distal to the left internal jugular/ brachiocephalic
  junction, without evidence of pneumothorax.
  
  Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary congestion
  although not well assessed.  No large focal consolidation or pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with septic shock from LLE cellulitis  // Assess CVL
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 10:01 at outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The exam is suboptimal due to patient motion.  A left-sided jugular central
 venous catheter is seen, distal portion not well seen, but possibly
 terminating just distal to the left internal jugular/brachiocephalic junction.
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable, given differences in
 inspiration the stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary congestion
 although not well assessed.  No large focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
