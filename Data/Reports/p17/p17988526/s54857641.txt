                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed
 mild bilateral pleural effusions, better visible than on the previous
 radiograph and better seen on the lateral than on the frontal image.  The size
 of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There are mild areas of basal
 atelectasis but no evidence of acute changes.  The right central venous access
 line has been removed in the interval.
