                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with neutropenic colitis, right colectomy, abdomen left
 open.
 
 COMPARISON:  Yesterday pre-op chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 New ET tube ends 5.4 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Right
 jugular line and right-sided PICC line are in adequate position in mid to
 lower SVC.  New left lower lobe consolidation is probably atelectasis with
 accompanying small pleural effusion; however, aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 New cardiac congestion is mild.  There is no pneumothorax.  The mediastinal
 and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 
 2.  New left lower lung opacification is probably atelectasis mixed with small
 pleural effusion.  Aspiration is also a possibility.
