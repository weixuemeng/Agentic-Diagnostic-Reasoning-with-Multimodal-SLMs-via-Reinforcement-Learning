                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Neutropenic colitis in a patient after exploratory
 laparotomy with ileostomy, now with fevers.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 6.4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is
 in the stomach.  Left basal consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions as
 well as a mild degree of pulmonary edema appear to be unchanged.  The right
 internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of low SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definitive evidence of pneumonia but left lower lobe opacity should be
 further observed to exclude the possibility of developing infectious process.
