                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Parkinsons disease, p/w fall. now with
 worsening delirium. looking for sources of infection.  // evidence of
 consolidation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Poorly defined opacity in left lower
 hemi thorax is probably a combination of small pleural effusion and adjacent
 atelectasis, but short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the
 possibility of an early focus of pneumonia given clinical suspicion for
 infection.
