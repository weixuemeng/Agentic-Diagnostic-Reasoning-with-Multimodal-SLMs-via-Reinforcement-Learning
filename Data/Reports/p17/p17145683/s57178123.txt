  1. Increased heart size, increased prominence of the azygos vein, and new
  right pleural effusion, consistent with a volume overloaded state.
  
  2. Opacity right lung base, most likely representing atelectasis.

  Opacity right lung base, most likely representing atelectasis. Probable small
  right pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with coarse breath sounds, pre-op  // Eval for
 infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from OSH from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are somewhat low. The heart has increased in size from prior
 exam, the azygos vein is more prominent than on prior, and there is a new
 right pleural effusion, consistent with a volume overload state. There is an
 opacity at the right lung base, likely representing atelectasis given the
 short time course of development from prior.  The opacity in the right medial
 lung likely represents the cardiac silhouette shifted due to patient rotation.
 The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no left pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. A VP shunt is noted passing to the right chest.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased heart size, increased prominence of the azygos vein, and new
 right pleural effusion, consistent with a volume overloaded state.
 
 2.  Opacity right lung base, most likely representing atelectasis.
