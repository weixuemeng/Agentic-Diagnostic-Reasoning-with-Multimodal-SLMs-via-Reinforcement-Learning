                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-operative abdominal distention.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low lung
 volumes.  Opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural fluid and
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  The left lung is essentially clear.  Mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists.  
 
 Of incidental note is a VP shunt projecting over the right hemithorax.
