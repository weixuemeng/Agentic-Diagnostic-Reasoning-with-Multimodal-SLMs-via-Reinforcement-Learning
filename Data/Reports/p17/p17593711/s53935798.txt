                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  There is new fullness in the AP window concerning for
 lymphadenopathy.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A partly
 circumscribed soft tissue density mass measuring approximately 2.8 cm in
 maximum diameter in the left lower lung zone is new since the prior study. 
 Slightly increased opacity of the right lower lung is also present.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is within normal limits. 
 
 Multiple new compression deformities with resultant kyphosis is present in the
 thoracic spine. There is stable appearance of an ovoid densely calcified focal
 lesion in the right humeral metadiaphysis, consistent with an enchondroma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New fullness in the AP window, concerning for lymphadenopathy as well as a
 large nodule in the left lower lung.  Chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
 2.  Slight increased opacity at the right lower lobe, which may represent
 infection.
 3. New compression deformities in the thoracic spine.
