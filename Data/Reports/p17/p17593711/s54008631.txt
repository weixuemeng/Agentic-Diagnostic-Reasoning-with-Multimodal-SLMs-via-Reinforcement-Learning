                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD, metastatic cancer, presented with MSSA
 bacteremia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right upper lobe focal consolidation is unchanged since ___, but worse
 than ___.  A left upper lobe focal consolation is more conspicuous
 today; those confluent opacities could reflect multifocal pneumonia.  The
 remaining of the exam is unchanged with a right-sided PICC line ending in
 lower SVC, moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  Cardiac
 congestion is probably overestimated due to the pulmonary emphysema.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Probable bilateral upper lobe pneumonia; the right side, unchanged since
 yesterday, but increased since ___ and the left side more
 conspicuous than yesterday's x-ray.
