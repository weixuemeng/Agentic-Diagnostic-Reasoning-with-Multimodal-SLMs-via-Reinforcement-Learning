                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  COPD, metastatic cancer presenting with MRSA
 bacteremia, increased white cell count and worsening respiratory status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11:46.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided PICC is stable in position.  There are persistent right
 mid-to-lower lung opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.  More focal
 lateral right upper lung opacity appears slightly more organized as compared
 to the prior study and possible evolving site of infection is of concern.
