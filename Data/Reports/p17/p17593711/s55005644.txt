                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there is diffuse increase in interstitial
 markings bilaterally, which may relate to fluid overload versus atypical
 infection.  There is a small left and trace right bilateral pleural effusions.
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are relatively
 stable.  Bilateral anterior consolidations described on chest CT from
 ___ were better assessed on that study.  More confluent right base
 opacity may relate to atelectasis and fluid overload; however, an area of
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
