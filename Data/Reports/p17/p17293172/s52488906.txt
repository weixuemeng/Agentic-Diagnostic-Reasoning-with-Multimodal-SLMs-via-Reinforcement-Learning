                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest tube placement, question change in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of a pigtail right-sided chest catheter with subsequent
 re-expansion of the right lung and significant reduction in the right
 pneumothorax which is now small.  Right mid to lower lung atelectasis is seen.
 There may be a small right pleural effusion.  There is elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm which may be due to underlying right base and/or right middle
 lobe collapse.  The left lung is clear.  There is no left pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax on the left.  The mediastinal silhouette is more wide
 as compared to the prior study but likely relates to AP portable technique,
 change in patient position and lower lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  VP shunt is again partially imaged projecting over the right
 hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right-sided chest catheter with subsequent
 re-expansion of the right lung and significant interval decrease in the
 previously seen large right pneumothorax which is now small.  Right lung
 atelectasis with possible partial collapse of the right middle lobe and there
 is subsequent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There may be a small
 right pleural effusion.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm can be seen in
 right lung collapse, however, can also be seen with subpulmonic effusion or
 intra-abdominal fluid.
