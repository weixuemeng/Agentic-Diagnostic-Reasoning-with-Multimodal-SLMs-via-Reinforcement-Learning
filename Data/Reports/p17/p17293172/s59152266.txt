                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hiatal hernia and VP shunt, now shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large right pneumothorax.  No significant mediastinal shift is seen.  There is
 some flattening of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is blunting of the
 posterior right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural
 effusion.  There is some atelectasis in the collapsed right lung.  The left
 lung is clear.  No left-sided pneumothorax is seen.  Partially imaged is a VP
 shunt projecting over the right chest, inferior aspect not well seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right pneumothorax, no significant mediastinal shift but
 one image demonstrates flattening of the right hemidiaphragm and thus
 underlying mild tension is not excluded.  Possible trace right pleural
 effusion.  Subsequent chest radiograph demonstrates right chest pigtail
 catheter in place with reexpansion of the right lung and significant decrease
 in size in the right pneumothorax, thus the ED was aware.
