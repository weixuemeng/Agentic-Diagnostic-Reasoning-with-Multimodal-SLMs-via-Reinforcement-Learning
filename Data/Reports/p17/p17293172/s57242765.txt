 There has been interval removal of the right chest tube.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  A portion of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt is again seen coursing over

 right base and patchy opacity at the left base which most likely represents
 atelectasis ,although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.
