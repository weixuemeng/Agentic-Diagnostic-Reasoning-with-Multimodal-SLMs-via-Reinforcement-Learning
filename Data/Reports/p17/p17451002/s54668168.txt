                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pain in the mid lung field and mid thorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs
 with some hyperinflation that would be consistent with COPD.  These changes
 are similar to those seen on previous exam.  The patient has also had
 intermittent small pulmonary opacities over the last several years, consistent
 with COPD. Previously seen right basilar infiltrate has resolved.  There is no
 evidence of acute parenchymal process or infection on this exam.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic pulmonary changes consistent with chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No evidence of acute pulmonary process.  
 
 These findings were communicated to Dr. ___ ___ by phone at 3:30 p.m.
