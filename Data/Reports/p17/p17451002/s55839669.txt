                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent rib fractures one month ago on the left, now abnormal
 breath sounds in left lower lung.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 On the left, there are healing fractures of the fifth and sixth posterior
 ribs.  No evidence of left pneumothorax or pneumonia.  Minimal atelectasis at
 the left lung base.  On the right, however, there is an area of pleural
 thickening.  The frontal image shows the pleural thickening projecting over
 the lateral lung regions, on the lateral radiograph this corresponds to mild
 fissural thickening, not present on the previous examination.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged as compared to ___. 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
 No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Healing left rib fractures without complications, minimal left
 basal atelectasis.  Lateral thickening of the right major fissure.  A followup
 radiograph should be obtained in six to eight weeks, in order to rule out
 increase in extent of newly appeared change.
 
 No other change as compared to ___.
