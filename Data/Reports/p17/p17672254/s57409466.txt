                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube appears to be in unchanged position.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance is re- demonstrated. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved
 in the interval, without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities in lung
 bases may reflect areas of atelectasis however infection or aspiration cannot
 be completely excluded.  Previously noted small left pleural effusion appears
 decreased or nearly resolved.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  A right-sided
 VP shunt catheter is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis, but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.  Improved mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion and decreased left pleural effusion.
