  Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding, allowing for this, there is
  likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with trach, tachypnea and tachycardia evaluate for pneumonia
 or other acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Allowing for this, there is likely mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt edema.  Retrocardiac opacification may represent
 atelectasis or early consolidation depending on the clinical setting.  There
 is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 stable.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 Ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing and a tracheostomy tube project in unchanged
 location.  A radiodensity projecting over the mid abdomen may represent a
 G-tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding, allowing for this, there is
 likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
