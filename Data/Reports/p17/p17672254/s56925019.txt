  1.  Left-sided PICC tip projects in the mid SVC.
  
  2.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
  
  3.  Persistent bibasilar opacities.  As on the prior study, these are likely
  areas of atelectasis.  However, superimposed aspiration or infection is
  possible.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with s/p trach, hemoptysis.  Evaluate for evidence
 of aspiration, infiltrate, trach placement, PICC line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a left-sided PICC line, with tip
 projecting at the mid SVC.  The tracheostomy tube appears unchanged in
 position.
 
 Lung volumes remain low, with persistent mild cardiomegaly.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with pulmonary vascular congestion is again noted. 
 Patchy opacities in the bilateral lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis,
 aspiration, or infection.  No larger pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left-sided PICC tip projects in the mid SVC.
 
 2.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Persistent bibasilar opacities.  As on the prior study, these are likely
 areas of atelectasis.  However, superimposed aspiration or infection is
 possible.
