  1. Retrocardiac opacification may represent basilar atelectasis in the setting
  of low lung volumes, however consider sequelae of aspiration or infection in
  the appropriate clinical setting.
  2. Left IJ central venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC, in unchanged
  position.  Stable appearance of tracheostomy tube.
  3. Mild cardiomegaly, as on prior exams.  This, in conjunction with centrally
  predominant airspace opacities and subtle interlobular septal thickening seen
  in the peripheral right lung is suggestive of continued pulmonary vascular
  congestion and some degree of volume overload.
  4. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with  bilateral SAH known pneumonia on antibotics
 but continually spiking fevers  // assess for new consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, pulmonary vascular congestion has is slightly
 improved, and bilateral perihilar opacities have also slightly decreased
 extent, particularly on the left where there is also improving aeration in the
 retrocardiac region.  No new or progressive lung findings.
