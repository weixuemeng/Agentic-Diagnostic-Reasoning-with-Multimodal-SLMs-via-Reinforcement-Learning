                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, left lower extremity infection,
 hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged and the aorta is unfolded though overall appearance is
 unchanged.  There are no overt signs of pulmonary edema.  There is mild
 retrocardiac opacity which could represent left lower lobe atelectasis though
 given underpenetrated technique, evaluation is limited.  There is no large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Clips are noted in the right neck, again similar to
 prior exam.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with possible left lower lobe atelectasis.  No
 overt signs of pneumonia or edema.
