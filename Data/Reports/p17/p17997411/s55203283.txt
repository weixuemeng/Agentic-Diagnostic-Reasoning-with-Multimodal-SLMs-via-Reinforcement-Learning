                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There is what
 appears to be eventration of left hemidiaphragm with underyling loops of
 stool-filled bowel.  Herniation is also possible.  Where well visualized, the
 lungs are clear.  There is no large effusion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unremarkable, noting that it is not well assessed.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Abnormal appearance
 of left hemidiaphragm with either eventration with underlying colonic loops
 below the diaphragm or possible intrathoracic herniation of the bowel loops. 
 Correlate with prior imaging if possible would be of use, otherwise CT scan
 could further characterize.
