                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable mild cardiomegaly accompanied by tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.  Extensive right-sided pleural calcifications with associated volume
 loss appear similar to the prior study, as well as associated parenchymal
 scarring.  In both upper lobes, there are scattered calcified granulomas.  No
 new lung or pleural abnormalities are identified.  Healed left rib fractures
 are present as well as diffuse osseous demineralization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with calcified
 fibrothorax on the right, and evidence of previous granulomatous infection
 within both lung apices.
