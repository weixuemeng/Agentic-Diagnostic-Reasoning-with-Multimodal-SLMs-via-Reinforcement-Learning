                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Vomiting and diarrhea with epigastric pain.
 
 No comparison studies available.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Hazy bibasilar opacities are present,
 more prominent at the right lower lobe, also demonstrated on the lateral view,
 possibly representing early consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The heart size is top normal.  The aorta is mildly
 calcified and tortuous.  There is mild prominence of the hila bilaterally,
 likely vascular.  No free air is seen. A chronic left clavicle deformity is
 present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:   Possible early right lower lobe consolidation.
