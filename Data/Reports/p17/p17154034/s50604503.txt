 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ years chronic cough, lifetime
 non-smoker, no history of cancer  // any infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is increased opacification at
 the bilateral bases which likely represents atelectasis, however pneumonia
 could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification of the bilateral bases likely represents atelectasis,
 however pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
