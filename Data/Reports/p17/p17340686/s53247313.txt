                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:15 P.M. ON ___
  
 HISTORY:  Suspect left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower exaggerating what is at least worsened moderate
 pulmonary edema.  More focal areas of opacification in the lateral left mid
 lung and infrahilar right lung could be atelectasis and edema but pneumonia is
 of serious concern.  The moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette and dilated
 pulmonary arteries are larger today, and there is more mediastinal vascular
 engorgement.  Dual channel right supraclavicular central venous line ends in
 the upper right atrium as before.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion
 and no pneumothorax.
