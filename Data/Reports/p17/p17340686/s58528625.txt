 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Clips project over the upper aspect of the abdomen.  The dialysis
 catheter tip sits in the superior right atrium.  The heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Perihilar opacities represent pulmonary edema, slightly worse than
 prior exam.  A subtle nodular opacity is present in the left suprahilar region
 and is new from ___.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle
 suggests small amount of pleural effusion.

 2. Subtle left suprahilar nodular opacity may represent a focal area of edema;
 repeat imaging after diuresis may be considered.
