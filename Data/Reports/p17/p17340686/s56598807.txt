                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and recent tunneled line in right for dialysis.  Evaluate
 line placement as well as a pneumonia versus effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A right-sided tunneled dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is redemonstration of peribronchial
 cuffing and increased interstitial markings, likely secondary to pulmonary
 edema.  Increased bilateral lung opacities refelct growing nodules. There is a
 new region of consolidation above the minor fissure which could refelct an
 early infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right-sided tunnel dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. 
 
 2.  Increased bilateral lung opacities reflect growing nodules. 
 
 3.  New region of consolidation above the minor fissure is concerning for an
 acute infectious process. Short interval followup recommended.
