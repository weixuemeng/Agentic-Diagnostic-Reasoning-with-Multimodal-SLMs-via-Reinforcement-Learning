                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain for five hours, question pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT torso from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph is provided.  A left central line
 catheter tip terminates within the right atrium.  Compared to the previous
 exam there is increased radiodensiy in the right lower lung zone and since the
 left lower lung is difficult to evaluate, it is unclear if this is a
 unilateral process.  The heart remains severely enlarged.  Multiple pulmonary
 nodules are better visualized in the prior CT.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Severe degenerative changes within the right shoulder are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased radiodensity in the right lower lung zone which may
 represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
