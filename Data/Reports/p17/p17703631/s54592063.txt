 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild vascular prominence without overt pulmonary edema. 
 There is a consolidation at the right base with blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  No other focal consolidation is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  The cardiac size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation at the right base may represent a developing
 pneumonia or atelectasis.  There is likely an associated small right pleural
 effusion.
