                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with high erythrocyte sedimentation
 rate, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size is within
 normal limits.  No configurational abnormalities identified.  The thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and shows calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at
 the level of the arch.  No local contour abnormalities are identified. 
 Mediastinal structures are within normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Moderately
 accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine with moderate degree of
 degenerative changes, no significant progression of these changes in
 comparison with the previous study of ___.
 
 Our records include also a chest CT of ___.  Two tiny _2-3 mm sized
 granulomatous changes were identified, but these are not large enough to be
 shown on routine PA and lateral chest examination.  The chest CT report of
 that time did not recommend further followup examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of CHF or acute pulmonary infiltrates.  No
 significant new abnormalities in comparison with similar study in ___.
