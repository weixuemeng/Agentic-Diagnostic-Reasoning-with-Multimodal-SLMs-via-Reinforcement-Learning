                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy with tracheostomy tube in unchanged
 position. Left main stem bronchial stent remains in unchanged position with
 narrowing of the stent proximally. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is
 accentuated due to low lung volumes but appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Bronchovascular crowding is re- demonstrated as a
 result of low lung volumes. Patchy opacities are seen within the right lung
 base. Additional hazy opacity within the left upper lung field appears new
 compared to the previous study, concerning for an area of infection.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No pneumothorax is seen. Left lateral
 pleural thickening is again demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Ill-defined hazy opacity in the left upper lung field as well as patchy
 opacity within the right lung base. Findings are concerning for areas of
 multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Left main stem bronchial stent in unchanged position, though the proximal
 aspect appears narrowed, new compared to the prior study.
