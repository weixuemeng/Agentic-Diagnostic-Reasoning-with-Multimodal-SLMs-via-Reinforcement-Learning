                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheal, left mainstem, and bronchus
 intermedius stenosis status post left main airway dilation.  Rule out
 pneumothorax.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Bilateral perihilar
 pulmonary opacities, involving the right lung greater than the left, are
 consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema given engorged and indistinct
 appearance of the pulmonary vessels.  Aspiration is less likely.  No
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is visualized.  No pleural effusion.  The
 heart size is stable.  Gastric distension is mild to moderate.  Sternotomy
 wires are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Asymmetric, right greater than left, perihilar opacities, most likely due
 to asymmetric edema given engorged pulmonary vessels.  Aspiration is
 considered less likely.  
 
 2.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. 
 
 3.  Mild to moderate gastric distention.
