                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates obscuration of the left
 diaphragm. Additional note is made of slight leftward deviation of the
 mediastinal structures reflective of volume loss within left hemithorax. A
 focal consolidation cannot be excluded. Underlying left pleural effusion may
 also be present. Heart is enlarged. Patient is status post median sternotomy
 with intact wires. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Obscuration of left hemidiaphragm with shift of mediastinal structures to the
 left consistent with significant volume loss, though a focal underlying
 consolidation due to infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  Underlying
 left pleural effusion may also be present.
