                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with connective tissue disease s/p left bronchial
 stent, p/w multifocal PNA, had stent removed, broncus dilated, improving
 clinically, but now w/ rising WBC on Abx  // interval change in PNA?   
 interval change in PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 I cannot see bronchial stents and the bronchial airways are also difficult to
 define.  Tracheostomy tube is midline.  A new band of atelectasis has
 developed in the right midlung.  Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart
 size, but mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion but no edema.  Pleural thickening is chronic and there is no
 pleural effusion.
 Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 3
 cm to reposition it in the low SVC if desired.
