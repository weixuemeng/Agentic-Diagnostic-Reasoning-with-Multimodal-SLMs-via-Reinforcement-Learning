                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, throat pain s/p intubation earlier today.  Assess
 for pneumonia or mediastinal air.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well inflated with left lower lobe atelectasis and elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size and hila are
 unremarkable.  Longitudinaly oriented bulbous air-filled structure along the
 middle mediastinum is seen delineating the right paratracheal stripe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bulbous air-filled structure along the middle mediastinum is most consistent
 with a gaseous distended esophagus from achalasia.
