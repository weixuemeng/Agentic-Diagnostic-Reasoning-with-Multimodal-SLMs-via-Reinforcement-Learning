                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post MVC, now with positive seatbelt sign,
 chest tenderness.
 
 STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:53 from an outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The heart size is within normal limits.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.  Assessment of the
 sternum is somewhat challenging due to overlying breast tissue, but within
 that limitation, it appears contiguous.  Correlation with exam is recommended
 and if there is clinical concern for a sternal fracture, CT may be considered.
