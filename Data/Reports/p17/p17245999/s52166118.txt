 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:44 AM
  
  
  
  A retrocardiac opacity and a probable small left pleural effusion are new from
  the recent CT and could reflect an infectious process in the proper clinical
  setting.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also new.  A small right
  pleural effusion, a left pectoral 3 lead pacemaker, and an accessed right
  chest wall port are unchanged from the recent CT.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with B cell lymphoma, started chemo, now with
 crackles on the left  // eval for pneumonia, effusion     eval for pneumonia,
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion,
 a discordance that raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy.  Pacer device is
 unchanged and there is a Port-A-Cath with its tip in the lower SVC.  There is
 increased opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic
 angle.  This is consistent with small left pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have
 to be considered.
 Minimal blunting is seen in the right costophrenic angle.
