 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lead AICD is visualized with leads in place in appropriate
 position.  Unchanged blunting of the right hemidiaphragm is identified and may
 be due to a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Mild cardiomegaly persists.  Mediastinal contours are normal.  Anterior
 wedging of the lower thoracic vertebral body is again unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process with stable mild cardiomegaly.
