 Left-sided pacer device is stable in position.  Right-sided Port-A-Cath is
 seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette moderately to markedly
 enlarged and the aorta calcified.  Persistent blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is seen consistent with a small left pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis.  Possible trace right pleural effusion is also present.
 Chain sutures are again noted at the right lung base.  Evidence of mitral
 annulus calcification is seen.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.

 Small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis and likely trace right
