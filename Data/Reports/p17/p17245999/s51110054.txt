                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Near syncope.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Streaky opacities in the medial lower lung
 suggests minor atelectasis.  Although the posterior costophrenic sulci are
 partly excluded, a meniscoid appearance to the posterior right lower
 hemithorax suggests a very small pleural effusion or thickening, but appears
 unchanged.  Slight nodular thickening along the minor fissure is also
 unchanged.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly blunting of the posterior right costophrenic sulcus,
 possibly a trace effusion or thickening, but no evidence of acute disease.
