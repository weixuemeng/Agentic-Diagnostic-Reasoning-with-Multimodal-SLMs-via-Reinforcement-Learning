                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Reported right hip fracture and unclear history of fall.  Assess
 for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heterogeneous bilateral mid and lower lung opacities are likely
 atelectasis, especially given slightly low lung volumes, although infection or
 aspiration pneumonitis could have a similar appearance.  There may be a small
 left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Aortic calcifications are seen.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  A concomitant
 process at the lung bases, such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis cannot
 be excluded.  
 
 2.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
