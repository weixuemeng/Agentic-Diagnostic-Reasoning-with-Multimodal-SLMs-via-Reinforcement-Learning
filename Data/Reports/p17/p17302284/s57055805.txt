                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea, evaluate for CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A small left pleural effusion and a moderate right pleural effusion are new
 from the prior study.  An opacity at the right lung base more likely
 represents early consolidation and atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax,
 pulmonary vascular congestion, or pulmonary edema.  A dual-chamber pacemaker
 and its leads project in expected location.  Sternotomy ___ and
 mediastinal clips are noted.  Moderate cardiomegaly is somewhat obscured by
 effusion but appears generally stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable consolidation in the right lower lobe.  Subsegmental atelectasis
 is possible but less likely.
 2. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are new.
 3. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.
 4. Likely unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
