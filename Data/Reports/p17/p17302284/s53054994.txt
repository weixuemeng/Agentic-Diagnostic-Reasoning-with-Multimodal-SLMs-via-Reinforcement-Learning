                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Progressive chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-lead left-sided pacer device is again seen with leads
 extending to the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
 There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggesting small
 pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, similar to prior.
 There is a subtle rounded opacity, measuring approximately 9 mm projecting
 over the right lung base, which is subtly present on the prior study and could
 relate to nipple shadow.  This could be confirmed with repeat with nipple
 markers.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Partially imaged left
 shoulder prosthesis is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  9-mm rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base is similar in
 appearance to that seen on ___ and most likely represents a nipple
 shadow.  This could be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.
