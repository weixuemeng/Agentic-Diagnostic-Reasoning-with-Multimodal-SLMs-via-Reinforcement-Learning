  No significant interval change.  Right base opacity could be due to
  consolidation from pneumonia, atelectasis felt less likely, particularly given
  that the mediastinum is shifted slightly to the contralateral side. 
  Underlying neoplastic process is not excluded either.  Recommend followup to
  resolution.  Consider nonemergent chest CT to further assess.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF exacerbation. Prior CXR with ?consolidation
 // please eval s/p diuresis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD is stable in position.  The appearance of the lungs is without
 significant interval change.  There are bilateral, right greater than left,
 pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Opacity at the right lung base
 raises concern for overlying pneumonia, underlying pulmonary mass is not
 excluded on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change in the appearance of the lungs.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Right base opacity is concerning
 for consolidation possibly due to infection, underlying neoplastic process is
 not excluded either. Recommend followup to resolution.  Consider nonemergent
 chest CT to further assess.  Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
