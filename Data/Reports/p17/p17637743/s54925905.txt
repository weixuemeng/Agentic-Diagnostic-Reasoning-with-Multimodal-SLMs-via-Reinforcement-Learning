                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a right empyema status post recent VATS
 decortication and chest tube removal on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left IJ catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged,
 but further assessment is limited by adjacent pleuropulmonary pathology. 
 Increased, moderate right pleural effusion.  Unchanged, moderate, subpulmonic
 left pleural effusion with poor aeration of the left lower lobe that most
 likely reflects atelectasis; however, pneumonia is also possible.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased, moderate right pleural effusion, responsible for greater left lower
 lobe atelectasis.
 Unchanged, moderate, subpulmonic left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
