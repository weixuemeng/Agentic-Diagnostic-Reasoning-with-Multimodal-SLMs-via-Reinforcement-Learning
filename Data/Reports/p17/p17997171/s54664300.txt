                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:
 Status post endotracheal intubation an orogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP semi-supine portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm
 above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach but probably by
 only about 5 cm. A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right
 ventricle. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable. There are new bilateral central opacities
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema. Small very small pleural effusions are
 present. The possibility of a developing focal opacity at the right lung base
 is not excluded within the right lower lobe. There is also patchy retrocardiac
 opacification.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation. Orogastric tube terminating in the
 stomach although advancing the tube somewhat would yield better seating.
 Bilateral perihilar opacities most suggestive of pulmonary edema. However,
 developing areas of atelectasis or pneumonia at the lung bases are possible.
 Small pleural effusions.
