                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with splenomegaly and splenic infarction  //
 ?Lymphadenopathy      ?Lymphadenopathy
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The heart is normal in size and is no vascular congestion,
 pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Specifically, no evidence of hilar
 or mediastinal adenopathy.  There is the suggestion of some medial
 displacement of the fundus of the stomach that could be a manifestation of
 enlargement of the spleen. However, cross-sectional imaging would be necessary
 to definitively make this diagnosis.
