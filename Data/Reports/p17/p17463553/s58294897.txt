                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A homogeneous opacity is present in the right infrahilar region,
 corresponding to the subcarinal area on the lateral view.  Remaining
 mediastinal contours are normal in appearance.  Hilar structures show slight
 asymmetry with the left appearing slightly more dense than the right.  Heart
 size is normal, and lungs are clear except for minimal biapical pleural and
 parenchymal scarring.  On the lateral view, there is a suggestion of an area
 of increased opacity in the lower retrosternal region just above the heart. 
 This could potentially be projectional.  No pleural effusion or acute skeletal
 abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right infrahilar mass, possibly a conglomeration of lymph nodes in the
 subcarinal area.  Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest is recommended for
 confirmation and further characterization of this finding.  At that time, the
 retrosternal area may also be assessed to exclude enlarged internal mammary
 nodes.  Findings and recommendation entered into radiology communications
 dashboard on ___.
