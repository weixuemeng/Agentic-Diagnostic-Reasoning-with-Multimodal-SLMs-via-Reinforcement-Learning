                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Interval position of ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:14.  
 
 ET tube is present in satisfactory position approximately 3.3 cm above the
 carina.  It has been retracted compared with the initial chest x-ray.  An NG
 tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm.  Side port overlying upper stomach and
 distal tip below the edge of this film. 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Extreme lateral portion of the lower right chest wall is
 excluded from the film.  
 
 Leftward positioning of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably related
 to rotation, but could reflect slight volume loss in the left chest.  The
 appearance is grossly unchanged.  The opacity at the left base is again noted,
 unchanged.  No CHF, new consolidation, or gross effusion.   No supine film
 evidence of pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Incidental note is made of contrast in non-dilated renal collecting systems
 s/p interval chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval repositioning of ET tube, now in satisfactory position.  
 2) Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Hazy retrocardiac opacity
 and possible leftward shift of the mediastinum are unchanged.  Please see
 comment above.
