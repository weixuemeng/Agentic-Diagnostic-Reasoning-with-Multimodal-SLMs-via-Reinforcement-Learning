 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 The aorta is mildly unfolded. Hilar contours are unremarkable. There is
 diffuse chronic interstitial abnormality, most severe in the right lower lobe.
 This is characterized by traction bronchiectasis and parenchymal scarring.  No
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present.  There is no
 acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic interstitial lung disease with fibrotic changes,
 compatible with the patient's history of sarcoidosis.  Evaluation for acute
