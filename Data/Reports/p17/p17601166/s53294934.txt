 right greater than left.  Given differences in positioning, these are likely
 not significantly changed.  Stable scattered patchy opacities in both lungs
 which either reflect patchy atelectasis or an infectious process.  No
 developing airspace consolidation is appreciated.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.
