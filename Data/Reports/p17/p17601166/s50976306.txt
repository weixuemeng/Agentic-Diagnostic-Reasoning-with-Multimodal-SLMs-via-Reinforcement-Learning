                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, known effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear opacities in both lung bases
 appear unchanged, likely subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle appears unchanged.  Left basilar density is
 compatible with prior pleurodesis, better seen on the prior CT.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.  Prior left-sided pleurodesis
 and chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle, potentially pleural
 thickening.  No large pleural effusion identified.
