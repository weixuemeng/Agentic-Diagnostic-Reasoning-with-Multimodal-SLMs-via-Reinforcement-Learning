                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with low sats/cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Relative increased
 opacity at the right lung base could be due to underlying infection or
 aspiration.  If the patient is able, PA and lateral views would be helpful for
 further evaluation.  Left lung clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at the right lung base could be due to
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation due to infection not excluded. 
 If patient able, repeat dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for
 further evaluation.
