                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endovascular aortic valve repair is noted in addition to a dual-lead
 pacemaker/ICD device.  The heart is again enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear similar.  In addition to small to moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, which are probably unchanged, there is increased prominence
 of pulmonary vasculature.  This suggests mild but worsening pulmonary edema. 
 Multiple vertebroplasty sites are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild but worsening pulmonary edema.  Stable moderate pleural effusions.
