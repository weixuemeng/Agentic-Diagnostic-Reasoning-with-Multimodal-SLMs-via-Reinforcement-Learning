 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Left hip replacement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 stable.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are noted, new since the prior study,
 but might be reflecting aspiration.  Attention to these areas on the
 subsequent studies is recommended.
