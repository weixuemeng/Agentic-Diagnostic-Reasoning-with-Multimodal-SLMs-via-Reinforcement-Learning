                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent multifocal pneumonia.  New concerns of recurrent
 infection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is hilar congestion and diffuse bilateral ground glass
 opacities, most predominant at the bases, slightly improved from prior exam,
 and most consistent with pulmonary edema.  An underlying pneumonia cannot be
 fully excluded.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and unchanged
 from the prior exam.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral ground glass opacities and small bilateral pleural
 effusions are consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  In the proper
 clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Can consider a repeat chest
 radiograph after diuresis.
