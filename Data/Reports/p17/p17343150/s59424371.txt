                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 Compared to prior study of ___.
 
 Direct comparison to prior study is limited due to marked rotation on today's
 exam.  With this limitation in mind, there has been apparent increase in
 extent of localized consolidation in the right upper lobe, concerning for
 infectious pneumonia.  Considering the somewhat rounded configuration of the
 opacity, followup radiographs after antibiotic therapy would be helpful to
 document resolution.  Contiguous linear opacity extends to the pleural
 surface.  Remainder of right lung and the left lung are clear.
