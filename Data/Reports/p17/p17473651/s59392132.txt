                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Rounded left
 basilar opacity most likely represents a Bochdalek hernia seen on the lateral
 view, although this could be confirmed on chest CT.  There is prominence of
 the ascending aorta which could relate to tortuosity although dilatation of
 the ascending aorta is not excluded.  The aorta is calcified.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left basilar opacity appears posterior on the lateral view and may relate
 to a Bochdalek hernia, which can be confirmed on CT.
 2.  Prominence of the ascending aorta could relate to tortuosity.  However,
 dilatation is not excluded and recommend further evaluation with nonurgent
 chest CT with IV contrast if no clinical contraindication.
 3.  No focal consolidation.
