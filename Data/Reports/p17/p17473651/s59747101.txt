                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with PICC placement, new ectopy on tele,
 concern for PICC needing to be pulled back  // re-eval for PICC placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___, earlier on the same day at
 17:48.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right PICC tip is in the proximal SVC, similar in position to the prior
 exam.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.  Right lateral costophrenic
 angle blunting may reflect pleural thickening or small effusion.  .  A 9-mm
 ovoid opacity projecting over the left fifth posterior rib is not clearly
 imaged on prior exams and could be superimposed normal structures given the
 short interval time course of development.  Left basilar atelectasis is mild. 
 The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The
 ascending and descending thoracic aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right PICC tip in proximal SVC, similar to the prior exam.
 2.  Trace right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
 3.  Apparent new nodular opacity in left upper lung is potentially due to a
 structure external to the patient.  Repeat radiograph following removal or
 repositioning of external devices may be helpful in this regard.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. requesting a
 wet read by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 1:10 AM, 1
 minutes after discovery of the findings.
