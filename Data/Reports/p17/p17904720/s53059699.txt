 otherwise unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, somewhat
 improved compared to the previous exam. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated.  Linear opacities within the left lung base may reflect
 atelectasis.  Multilevel moderate degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.  Clips are noted projecting over the left lower hemithorax.

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and left basilar atelectasis.
