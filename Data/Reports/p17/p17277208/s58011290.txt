 FINDINGS: 
 
 No re-accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions.  A drain projects over the

 disease are overall similar in size and appearance with the exception of the
 right paramediastinal lesion which is less distinct on today's exam but
 probably still some.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation.  The heart is
 normal in size.

 CT.
