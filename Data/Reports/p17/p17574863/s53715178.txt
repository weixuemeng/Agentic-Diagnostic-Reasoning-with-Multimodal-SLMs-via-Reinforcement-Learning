                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplant on
 ___, now with persistent bacteremia, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show interval removal
 of a right-sided PICC line and a feeding tube.  A left supraclavicular
 dual-channel dialysis catheter is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating in the right atrium.  The lung volumes are persistently low.  A
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged with increased
 opacification at the right lung base now silhouetting the right heart border,
 which may represent compressive atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical context.  Atelectasis at the left lung base is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased opacification of the right lung base may represent compressive
 atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 2.  Stable small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
