                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 14:08
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with OLT, on CVVH, question pulmonary edema,
 question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 3:44.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film on ___ at 14:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central line and left subclavian central lines both
 have their tips in the proximal SVC, unchanged in position.  A feeding tube
 courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Lung volumes remain
 markedly diminished with some crowding of pulmonary vasculature and some
 patchy opacity at both bases, which likely reflects bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal
 contours, given differences in positioning.
