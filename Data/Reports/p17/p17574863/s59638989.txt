  Left large bore CV catheter terminating in right atrium.  Feeding tube at
  least within the stomach - tip not imaged.  Increased density of both lungs,
  R>L - concerning for layering pleural fluid given positioning, particularly on
  the right.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis though infection (right base
  especially) cannot be excluded.  Central venous congestion likely - though no
  overt edema.  ___ p_________________________________________________________________________________
