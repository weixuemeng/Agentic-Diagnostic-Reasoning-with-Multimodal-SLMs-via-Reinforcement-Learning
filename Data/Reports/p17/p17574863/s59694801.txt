 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, confirm readjustment of nasogastric
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the feeding tube now passes
 below the diaphragm into the expected region of the stomach.  Then the tube is
 coiled on itself with its tip above the diaphragm, projecting over the
 expected region of the mid distal esophagus.  This tube position needs to be
 revised.  A telephone information was given at the time of the wet read.
