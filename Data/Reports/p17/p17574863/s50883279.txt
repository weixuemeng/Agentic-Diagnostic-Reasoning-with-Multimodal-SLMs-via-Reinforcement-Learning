                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:21 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  To replace nasogastric tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Views of the chest and upper abdomen shows a nasogastric tube
 ending in the distal stomach.  Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary
 artery.  Mild interstitial edema persists.  Moderate cardiomegaly has
 improved, but mediastinal vascular engorgement is unchanged.  ET tube ends at
 the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 5 cm from the carina.  Lateral
 aspect left hemithorax is excluded from the examination.  The other pleural
 margins are normal, but I suspect posteriorly layering right pleural effusion
 at least small size.  No pneumothorax.
