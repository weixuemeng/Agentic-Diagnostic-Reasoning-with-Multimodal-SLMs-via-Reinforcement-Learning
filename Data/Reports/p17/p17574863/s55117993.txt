                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of a zone of increased opacity in the retrocardiac lung areas.  In the
 appropriate setting, this change could represent pneumonia but this
 possibility remains unlikely given the stability over almost 10 months.  No
 overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Unchanged position of the dialysis catheter.
