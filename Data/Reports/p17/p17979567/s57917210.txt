                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with gram-negative bacteremia and cough.  Question
 new pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Frontal view suggests a new very small region of consolidation at
 the base of the left lung projecting over the posterior left tenth rib.  The
 region is so small, I would not expect to see it confirmed on the lateral
 view, which is essentially clear.  In order to verify this finding, we would
 require oblique views.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Small pleural effusions
 seen only on the lateral view with certainty could have been present
 previously.
 
 Heart size is normal and pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  Mild
 mediastinal widening, particularly to the right of midline is nevertheless due
 to mediastinal fat deposition demonstrated by chest CT on ___.
