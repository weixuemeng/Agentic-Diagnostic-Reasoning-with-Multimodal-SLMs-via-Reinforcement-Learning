                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NASH cirrhossi complicated by neuroendocrine
 tumor presents with ___ and possible pneumonia  // Please eval for acute
 pneumonia and confirm PICC is in proper place
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mediastinum it is no longer widened.  New opacification of the basal left lung
 is accompanied by ipsilateral mediastinal shift suggesting a large component
 of atelectasis. Lateral view shows clearly a moderate posteriorly layering
 pleural effusions
 
 A Poorly defined opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the right
 first rib is more prominent today than it has been previously.  I am concerned
 that this may be a pleural or subpleural lung lesion and would recommend, at a
 minimum, a lordotic view. CT scanning may ultimately prove necessary. Feeding
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right PIC line ends in the mid
 to low SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
