                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs from ___, torso CT from ___, and recent spine MR studies.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Slight unfolding of the thoracic
 aorta is noted.  The arch is partly calcified.  Subpleural thickening is mild
 at each lung apex and appears unchanged, suggesting minor scarring.  There is
 a new fairly dense nodular focus projecting over the left upper lung as well
 as the course of the left posterior fifth rib, although not present on prior
 studies depicting the ribs; the focus measures approximately 8 mm in diameter.
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is extensive sclerosis in a lower thoracic vertebral body; this finding
 corresponds to metastatic disease as recently characterized on spine MR.  
 
 ___:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Findings consistent with bony metastatic disease associated with prostate
 cancer along the thoracic spine.
 
 3.  Small nodular focus projecting along the course of the left posterior
 fifth rib and left upper lobe.  Differential considerations include bony
 metastatic disease in the rib versus potentially a new pulmonary nodule (the
 former probably more likely based on high density).
