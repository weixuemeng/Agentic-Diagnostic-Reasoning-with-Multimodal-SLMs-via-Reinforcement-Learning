                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with fever and cough, evaluate for
 infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  Similar as to the previous examination, there
 is evidence of a subclavian approach central venous line terminating in the
 lower SVC.  It most likely represents a Port-A-Cath system.  Heart size
 remains normal and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but does not demonstrate any
 new local contour abnormalities.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested
 but somewhat irregular in the periphery, a finding which in conjunction with
 the low positioned and flattened diaphragm is suggestive of COPD.  Acute new
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the
 apical area where there exist bilateral apical local pleural thickening which
 are smoothly delineated.  Skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate some
 mild degree of degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as identified on the
 lateral view, but no evidence of any significant vertebral body compression
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of pulmonary congestion or
 acute infiltrates, but typical signs compatible with COPD.
