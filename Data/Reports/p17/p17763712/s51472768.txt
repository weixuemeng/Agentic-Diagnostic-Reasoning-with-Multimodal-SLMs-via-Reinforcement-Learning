 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 12:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 18:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decrease in size of layering left effusion status post thoracentesis
 with no evidence of pneumothorax.  Right Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Persistent faint
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect patchy atelectasis in the setting of small
 effusions.  Left upper lobe opacity is unchanged and consistent with radiation
 change when correlated with recent chest CT and the patient's clinical
 history.  No pulmonary edema.
