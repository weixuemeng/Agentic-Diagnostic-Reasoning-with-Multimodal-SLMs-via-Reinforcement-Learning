                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Status post transfusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  Within the limitations in technique, aside from calcification along
 the aortic arch, the cardiac and mediastinal contours appear within normal
 limits.  There is perhaps slight atelectasis at the left lung base.  The
 interstitium is mildly prominent.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial prominence, suggesting slight fluid overload, not
 striking.
