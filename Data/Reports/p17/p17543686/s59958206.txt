 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:06 PM
  Opacity with angular margins at the left lung base anteriorly with elevated
  left hemidiaphragm. Prior imaging studies are not available for viewing, but
  reports from prior chest radiographs and CTs in the Atrius system describe
  known chronic left pleural scarring from prior surgery. Given the angular
  margins of this density and volume loss in this area, this most likely
  corresponds to known chronic scarring. But in the absence of prior images,
  consolidation cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended. Close
  follow up imaging could be obtained to evaluate for change. If clinically
  indicated, CT could be performed for further evaluation. Discussed with ___
  ___ by phone at 9 p.m. on ___ at time of initial review of the study
  in response to wet read request.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Asthma and cough.  Patient is status post radical
 prostatectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with CT ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal. There is increase in the mediastinal fat at the left
 cardiophrenic angle. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, likely chronic.  The lungs are grossly
 clear.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with emphysema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No evidence of pneumonia.
