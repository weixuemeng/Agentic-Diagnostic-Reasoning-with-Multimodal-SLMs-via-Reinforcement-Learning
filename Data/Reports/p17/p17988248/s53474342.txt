 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:39 PM
  New ground-glass opacity surrounding the right lower lobe lung mass as well as
  in the right upper lobe.  Given the rapid onset since yesterday's clear exam,
  consider alveolar hemorrhage or edema.  Expected position of the left mainstem
  bronchus stent.  Acceptable endotracheal tube position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stent placement, respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 stent in the left main stem bronchus.  The patient also is intubated.  The tip
 of the endotracheal tube projects 4.7 cm above the carina.  There is a new
 parenchymal opacity, surrounding the known mass in the right lower lung, that
 shows air bronchograms and could reflect either infection, aspiration or
 bleeding.  The overall volume of the left hemithorax is substantially reduced.
 No pathological parenchymal changes in the left lung.
