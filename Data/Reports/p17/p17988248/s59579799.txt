                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recently diagnosed right lower lobe
 non-small cell lung cancer with airway obstruction.  Admission for
 bronchoscopy.  Rule out post-obstructive pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is focal consolidation
 within the right lower lobe.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Nipple shadows are identified bilaterally projecting over the
 lower lungs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe region of consolidation.  This is compatible
 with patient's diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.  Post-obstructive
 atelectasis and/or pneumonia would be impossible to exclude.
