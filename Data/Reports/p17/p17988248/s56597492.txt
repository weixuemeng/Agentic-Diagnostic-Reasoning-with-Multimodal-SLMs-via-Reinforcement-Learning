 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, status post interventional procedure,
 rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has undergone an
 interventional procedure.  A stent is visualized in the central bronchial
 system.  The right lung is better ventilated than on the previous examination.
 However, a mass-like opacity in the right lower lung and, potentially, in the
 middle lobe, persists.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 appearance of the left lung is normal.
