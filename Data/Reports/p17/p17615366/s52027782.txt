                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of palpitations.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are similar.  The ascending aorta appears slightly more prominent,
 which may relate to low lung volume; however, followup frontal radiograph with
 better inspiration or CT with contrast can be obtained to assess aortic
 diameter.  Evidence of DISH is seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  The ascending aorta appears slightly more prominent as compared to the
 prior study, which may relate to low lung volumes; however, this could be
 further evaluated with repeat PA upright radiograph with deeper inspiration or
 CT with contrast.
