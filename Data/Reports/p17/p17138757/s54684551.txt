 HISTORY:  Cough and altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS: Chest, PA and lateral.  There is subtle opacity in the left lower
 lobe in the setting of low lung volumes, likely atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise underinflated but clear.  The cardiac silhouette is minimally
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  An implanted pacemaker is present, with appropriately
 positioned leads.  There is calcification of the thoracic aorta.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe atelectasis, less likely pneumonia..
