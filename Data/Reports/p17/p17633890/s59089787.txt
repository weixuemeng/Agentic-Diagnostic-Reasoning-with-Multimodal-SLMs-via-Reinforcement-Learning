                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Lethargy and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Although technique and low lung volumes are somewhat limiting, there is a
 suggestion of mild interstitial abnormality.  No focal opacification is
 visualized, however.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interstitial abnormality.  Pulmonary congestion could be
 considered versus an inflammatory airway process.
