 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are slightly low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and
 heart size, which is mildly enlarged.  There is hazy opacification in the
 retrocardiac region in the left lung.  Linear scarring/atelectasis in the left
 mid lung is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or
 large pleural effusion.  Changes related to prior median sternotomy and valve
 replacement are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy retrocardiac opacity could reflect aspiration or pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
