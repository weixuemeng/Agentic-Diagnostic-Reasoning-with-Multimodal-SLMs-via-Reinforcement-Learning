 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral
 basilar opacities have improved.  Improvement is emphasized by the
 simultaneous decrease of atelectatic changes at both lung bases.  No new
 parenchymal opacities.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette,
 unchanged mild bronchiectatic changes in the dorsal aspects of the lung, best
 seen on the lateral radiograph.  Status post valvular surgery.
