                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETOH admitted with GIB reporting chest
 burning, sob and cough. Infiltrate seen on initial X ray.  // Please evaluate
 for pneumonia
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left retrocardiac
 opacity has nearly resolved with minimal linear opacities remaining.   Lungs
 are hyperinflated and note is made of linear atelectasis or scarring at the
 right base. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.  Heart
 size is normal and note is made of previous median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rapidly improved left lower lobe opacity.  Such rapid improvement strongly
 favors atelectasis or aspiration over infectious pneumonia. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
