 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:57 PM
  Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying
  consolidation not excluded. Small nodular opacities at the right lung base may
  also reflect infectious process. Right upper lung appears unremarkable on this
  examination.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with finding of New patchy ground glass opacities
 in the apical right upper lobe may reflect an infectious process on CT cspine 
 // acute pulmonary process?
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison studies. Please note that comparison to old films
 can be helpful to detect subtle interval change.  Comparison is made to
 selected images from the recent cervical spine CT dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The heart appears enlarged, although the left heart border is obscured by the
 either an elevated left hemidiaphragm or a moderate-sized left pleural
 effusion with associated partial lower lobe atelectasis. An underlying mass in
 this area cannot be excluded. A few small nodular opacities at the left apex
 are felt to more likely be related to the first costochondral junction rather
 than representing pulmonary nodules. The right lung appears grossly clear.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Given the
 subtle ground-glass opacity on recent cervical spine CT, further imaging
 evaluation with a chest CT would be recommended. Hardware is seen overlying
 the mid to lower cervical spine consistent with prior surgery.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were entered into the radiology critical results
 dashboard on the ___ at 09:44.
