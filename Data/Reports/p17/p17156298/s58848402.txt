                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AMS, leukocytosis  // Any evidence of
 infection/pneumonia?      Any evidence of infection/pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:41 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked thoracolumbar scoliosis. A left-sided dual lead pacer remains in place
 and the heart remains enlarged.  A prosthetic aortic valve remains in place.
 On the current study, the retrocardiac area is obscured by the pacemaker and
 therefore cannot be adequately evaluated.  Lung volumes remain markedly low
 with crowding of the vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax
 is appreciated. There is interposition of the colon between the diaphragm and
 liver consistent with Chiladiti's. Deformity of the body of the right scapula
 consistent with recent trauma and possible associated right-sided rib
 fracture, both of which were better assessed on the CT of the chest performed
 ___.
