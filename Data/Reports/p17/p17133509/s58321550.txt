                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart is mildly enlarged with unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Central pulmonary vascular congestion is seen with moderate
 interstitial edema.  Subtly increased basal density is seen posteriorly on
 lateral view.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion, moderate interstitial
 edema and small bilateral effusions.
 2. Subtle posterior basal density which was seen previously, though pneumonia
 is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3. Hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.
