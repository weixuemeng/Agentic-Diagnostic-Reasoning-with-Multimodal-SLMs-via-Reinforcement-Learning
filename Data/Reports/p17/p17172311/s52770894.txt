 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypotension, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided.  Lungs appear
 hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency suggesting underlying emphysema.  There
 is mild but stable linear opacity in the lower lungs, likely representing
 atelectasis or scarring.  The left CP angle is excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with emphysema without superimposed acute
 intrathoracic process.
