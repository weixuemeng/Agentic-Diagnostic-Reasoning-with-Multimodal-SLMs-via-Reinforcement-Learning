                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP and lateral chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with fever and cough, evaluate for pneumonia or
 other acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral upright chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes appear stable. The bilateral hila are within
 normal limits. Mild hyperinflation, best appreciated on lateral view, again
 suggests underlying COPD, though this is less apparent than on prior study.
 The lungs are clear without evidence of focal airspace abnormality. There is
 no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or effusion. There is mild levoscoliosis of the upper thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild hyperinflation suggestive of underlying COPD without evidence of
 superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process.  No significant change from prior
 exam.
