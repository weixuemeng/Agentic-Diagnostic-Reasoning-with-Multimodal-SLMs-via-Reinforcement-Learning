                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with weight loss.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are
 within normal limits.
 
 There is generalized osteopenia and multilevel spinal degenerative changes.
 The patient is status post right femoral head fixation. Flowing anterior
 spinal ossification involving multiple contiguous vertebral bodies with
 relative preservation of the intervertebral disc spaces is compatible with
 diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).  A chronic compression
 fracture involving a lower thoracic vertebral body results in moderate loss of
 vertebral body height.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Clear lungs.
 
 Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).
 
 Chronic lower thoracic spine compression fracture.
