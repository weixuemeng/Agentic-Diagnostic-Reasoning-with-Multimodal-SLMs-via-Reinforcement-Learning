                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and history of Y airway stent.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT trachea ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The
 hilar contours are normal without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. 
 There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A stent is
 noted within the trachea, though extension in to the main bronchi is not
 completely assessed.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis.  Airway stent noted within the trachea
 though extension into the proximal mainstem bronchi is not well assessed, as
 would be expected for a Y stent.  If there is continued concern for stent
 malpositioning, CT is a more sensitive exam.
