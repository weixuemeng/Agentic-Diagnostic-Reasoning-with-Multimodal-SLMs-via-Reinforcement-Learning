                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and a CT chest from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of sarcoidosis, acute onset
 chest pain starting at 2 a.m. last night which woke her from sleep, pain is
 intermittent and nonradiating, lasting three minutes at a time.  No short of
 breath, currently no pain.  Assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes are
 slightly low, though accounting for this, there is diffuse interstitial
 prominence which could reflect known sarcoidosis.  An element of superimposed
 interstitial edema is difficult to exclude.  The heart is top normal in size. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Diffuse interstitial opacity which
 could reflect known sarcoidosis, though a component of superimposed edema
 difficult to exclude.  Please correlate clinically.
