                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dating between ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size, and the aorta is diffusely tortuous.  A
 focal opacity overlying the left third anterior rib level is similar compared
 to multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___, and
 probably represents a healed rib fracture.  No focal areas of consolidation
 are present within the lungs.  Prominent pericardial fat pads are present
 bilaterally with minimal scarring adjacent to the left fat pad without change.
 Skeletal structures are remarkable for multilevel degenerative changes in the
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
