                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after hospitalization for multifocal pneumonia at___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to most recent prior chest
 radiograph here, ___, and series of radiographs over more than
 ___ years.
 
 It would be extremely helpful to have radiographs documenting the pneumonia
 described.  The lungs look very similar today to their appearance on ___.  The opacification at the base of the right lung on the frontal view is
 due to large mediastinal fat collection, not an abnormality in the lower lobe.
 There is a suggestion of some peribronchial infiltration in the right upper
 lobe, partially obscured by the first rib.  On the left, the same is true, but
 appearance was similar on ___. 
 
 The ___-mm wide nodule in the left upper lung projecting over the third rib is
 longstanding. The lateral view shows obliteration of a mid thoracic
 intervertebral disc space and loss of height in the two surrounding vertebrae
 as well as the one just above, also stable over several years.  The
 generalized increase in radiodensity of the vertebral bodies is due to chronic
 renal failure.
 
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings by telephone.
