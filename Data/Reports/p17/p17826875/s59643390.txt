                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are clear,
 though hyperinflated without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Linear left lower lung density is stable and likely represents an area of
 scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Atherosclerotic
 calcification along the aortic knob noted.  A density projecting over the left
 mid lung likely reflects an old rib fracture and has been seen dating back to
 multiple prior studies from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
