                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.  History lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new moderate-to-large pleural effusion on the right side which
 occupies much of the right chest with right upper and basilar lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The right hilum is enlarged raising concern for malignant
 involvement.  There is a small pleural effusion on the left.  An irregular
 nodule is not very well visualized in the left upper lobe but corresponds to a
 vague left suprahilar opacity which is similar to the prior study. The bones
 appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large right-sided pleural effusion with extensive atelectasis in
 basilar segments of the right lower lobe as well as right upper lobe.  This
 appearance includes right hilar enlargement.  Malignancy is a likely
 explanation for these findings.
