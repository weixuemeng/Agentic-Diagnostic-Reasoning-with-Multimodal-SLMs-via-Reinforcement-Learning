                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hyperglycemia, orthostasis, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Elevated right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  There is a nodular opacity projecting at the
 right lung base at the intersection of the right eighth posterior and sixth
 anterior ribs, possibly representing superimposed shadows though the
 possibility of a true pulmonary nodule is not excluded.  Consider oblique
 views to better assess.  There are no signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague nodular opacity at the intersection of the right eighth
 posterior and right sixth anterior ribs, question true pulmonary nodule. 
 Oblique views may be obtained to further assess.
