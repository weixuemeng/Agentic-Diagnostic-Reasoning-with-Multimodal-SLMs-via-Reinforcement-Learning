                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ams, fever  // please evaluate for infectious
 process, fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient's overlying chin obscures the left lung apex in the medial right lung
 apex.  The patient arm/hand partially obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  Given
 the above, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Aortic
 knob calcification is seen.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal study due to the patient's overlying chin obscuring the left lung
 apex and medial right lung apex as well the patient's overlying upper
 extremity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  Given this, no definite acute
 cardiopulmonary process seen.
