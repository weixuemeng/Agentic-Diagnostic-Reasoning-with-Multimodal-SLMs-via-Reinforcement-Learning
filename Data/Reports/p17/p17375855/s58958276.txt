                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent pneumonia, please do xray to follow
 up infiltrate  // follow up infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:   PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is evidence seen on frontal projection of an old, healed right humeral
 fracture. Otherwise the visualized bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. The bilateral hila
 are normal.
 
 There is interval progressive resolution of the left lower lobe opacity which
 was previously seen. However, there still remains some residual opacification
 best appreciated on lateral projection.  Given timing of this study as
 compared to prior radiograph, this may simply represent residual fibrous
 change of lung parenchyma following left lower lobe pneumonia.
 
 Otherwise there are no new focal lung consolidations. There is no evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion. There are no pneumothoraces or effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval progressive resolution of left lower lobe consolidation. Residual
 opacification in this area may simply represent resultant fibrous change of
 lung parenchyma following pneumonia.  Otherwise stable chest x-ray.
