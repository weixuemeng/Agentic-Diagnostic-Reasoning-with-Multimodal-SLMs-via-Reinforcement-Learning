 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  There is evidence of bilateral basal atelectasis.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  At today's radiograph, there is a mildly increasing density at
 the level of both perihilar areas.  Short-term repeat followup is required to
 exclude developing pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pleural effusions (the
 left lateral part of the costophrenic sinus is not included in the image).
