                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There appear to be
 minimal linear and patchy opacities both lower lobes with peribronchial
 cuffing.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lower lobes with peribronchial cuffing. Findings could
 reflect airways disease such as bronchitis, with associated atelectasis, but
 developing infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
