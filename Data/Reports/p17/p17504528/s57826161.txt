 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.

 left hilum.  A mechanical mitral valve is again noted.  A small left pleural
 effusion versus pleural thickening is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.  Again seen are multiple surgical clips projecting in the left upper
 quadrant.
 Left apical changes may be related to radiation changes versus sequela of
 prior granulomatous disease.
