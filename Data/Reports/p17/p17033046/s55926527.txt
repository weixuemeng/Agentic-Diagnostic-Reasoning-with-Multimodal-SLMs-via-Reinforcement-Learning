                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, AVR, question pulmonary edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A right IJ catheter or sheath overlies in the proximal/mid SVC.  
 
 There is probable background COPD.  The patient is status post sternotomy,
 with prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and vascular plethora and diffuse vascular blurring, with
 interstitial edema and probably with some component of basilar alveolar edema,
 consistent with CHF.  No gross effusion.  There is retrocardiac density,
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  COPD, with probable background interstitial changes.
 2.  CHF, overall similar or possibly slightly worse compared with ___ at
 7:19 a.m.
 3.  The possibility of some collapse/consolidation at left base cannot be
 excluded.
