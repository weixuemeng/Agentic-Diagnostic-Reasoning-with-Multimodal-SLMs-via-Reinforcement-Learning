                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M POD#5 from AV replacement, CABGx2 with persistent oxygen
 requirement  // ___M POD#5 from AV replacement, CABGx2 with persistent oxygen
 requirement; evaluate for edema/effusion
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest x-ray from ___ at 07:28.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right IJ sheath overlies the mid SVC.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette. There are diffuse increased interstitial
 markings -- some of this is probably vascular, reflecting CHF, but the
 possibility of underlying interstitial changes cannot be excluded. The right
 hemidiaphragm is slightly better defined. No gross effusion is identified. No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Stool noted in descending colon.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No gross change compared with 1 day prior, allowing for technical differences.
 Diffuse prominence of vessels and interstitial markings likely represent CHF,
 though the preoperative film also showed some background interstitial changes
 suggestive of fibrosis.
 
 Please note that in this setting, a superimposed interstitial infectious
 process would be difficult to exclude.
