                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CABG  // Eval interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is within normal limits. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right

 pulmonary artery.  There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and
 esophageal tube.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The right lung is clear.  There is minimal atelectasis
 at the left base. Lucency along the right heart border likely represents small
 pneumopericardium. There is evidence of gastric overinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right main pulmonary artery and could
 be pulled back 2-3 cm to be in the main pulmonary artery.
