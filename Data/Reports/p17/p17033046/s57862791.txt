 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // eval effusions
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube has been removed. A right central venous catheter ends
 at the cavoatrial junction. A Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach. Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again identified.
 
 Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, the combination of baseline interstitial
 lung disease and non cardiac edema, is generally increased, particularly in
 the left lower ___, ___ be due slightly lower lung volumes, but worsening
 edema is suspected.  There is a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax
 is identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Decreased lung volumes and
 increased opacity throughout the lungs.  Apparent radiographic worsening ___
 be due in part to withdrawal of positive pressure support, however, worsening
 lung disease is suspected.
