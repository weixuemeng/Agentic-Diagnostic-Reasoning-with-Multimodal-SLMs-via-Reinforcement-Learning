                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DHT reposition.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 9:11 a.m.
 
 A Dobhoff tube  is present.  The entire DHT is not included on this film, but
 the radiopaque portion lies in the left upper quadrant, most likely related to
 the gastric fundus. A portion of the DHT extends beyond the inferior edge of
 these films so the continuity between the main portion of the line cannot be
 established on the basis of this film.  
 
 Compared to ___ at 9:11 a.m., the cardiomediastinal and pulmonary findings
 are grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Based on this view, the Dobbhoff has not passed beyond the
 pylorus, but overlies the expected location of the fundus. This assumes that
 the radiopaque portion of the tube is contiguous with the portion extending
 through the mediastinum, though the entire tube is not contiguously visualized
 on this film.
