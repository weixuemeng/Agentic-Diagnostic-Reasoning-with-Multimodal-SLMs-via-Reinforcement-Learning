                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with possible aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single upright portable frontal radiograph of the chest
 demonstrates low lung volumes, with no evidence of pneumothorax, large pleural
 effusion, or overt pulmonary edema.  Low lung volumes accentuate the bilateral
 pulmonary vasculature, with hazy opacity about the infrahilar right lung,
 possibly due to aspiration or infection.  No acute osseous injury is detected.
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Calcifications are noted in the aortic
 arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, with hazy opacity in the infrahilar right lung,
 possibly due to aspiration or infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
