                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Right rib pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Left basilar
 opacity is seen, which could be due to atelectasis, although aspiration or
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting, neither is
 contusion, although the patient states pain is on the right.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Subtle left basilar opacity may relate to this; however, underlying
 atelectasis or even subtle consolidation due to pneumonia or aspiration or
 even contusion not excluded.  No displaced fracture is seen.  If high clinical
 concern for rib fracture, CT or dedicated rib series with BB marker over site
 of pain, is more sensitive.
