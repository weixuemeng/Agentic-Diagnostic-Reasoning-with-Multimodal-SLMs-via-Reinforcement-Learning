                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever  // eval for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Streaky
 opacity at the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  No focal opacity
 convincing for pneumonia is present.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Spinal hardware is noted
 involving the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacity at the left lung base appears atelectatic in etiology though
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
