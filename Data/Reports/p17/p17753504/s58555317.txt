                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, possible GI or GU source but unable to give good history or
 respiratory exam due to language barrier, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with increased AP diameter and
 flattening of the diaphragms suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 There is minimal lingular atelectasis/scarring as well as possible mild left
 basilar atelectasis/scarring.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is
 minimal right apical pleural thickening.  No pleural effusion or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No findings to suggest pneumonia.  Likely
 COPD.
