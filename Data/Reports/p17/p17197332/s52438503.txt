 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with question new onset congestive heart failure and
 increased sputum production who presented to the ED with confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is again noted with leads terminating in the regions of
 the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  Mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance is again noted.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 Increased interstitial opacities are most pronounced along the lung bases and
 the periphery compatible with a chronic interstitial abnormality, not
 substantially changed in the interval.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic interstitial lung disease without new areas of focal consolidation. 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly without congestive heart failure.
