  Increased densities present on the lateral chest radiograph at the posterior
  costophrenic angle relative to study dated ___ may reflect
  superimposed shadows and atelectasis although infectious process cannot be
  entirely excluded for which clinical correlation is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with cp  // ?cause of cp
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a linear opacity projecting over
 the left lower lung zone likely scarring or atelectasis.  Best appreciated on
 the lateral view, there appears to be increased opacities which may reflect
 superimposed shadows or alternatively sequela of atelectasis.  The right lung
 is clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within normal
 limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased densities present on the lateral chest radiograph at the posterior
 costophrenic angle relative to study dated ___ may reflect
 superimposed shadows and atelectasis although infectious process cannot be
 entirely excluded for which clinical correlation is recommended.
