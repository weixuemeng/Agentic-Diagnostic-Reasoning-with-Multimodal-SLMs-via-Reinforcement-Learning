                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult given the presence of a
 moderate size right pleural effusion, new in the interval, and a small left
 pleural effusion.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively
 similar.  There appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Multilevel mild to moderate degenerative changes
 are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left,
 with bibasilar airspace opacities potentially reflecting compressive
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.  Possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
