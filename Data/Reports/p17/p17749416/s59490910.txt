                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent PNA and effusion.  // ? pleural
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, a large right pleural effusion
 persists with adjacent atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower
 lobes.  Prominence of the right hilar contour is difficult to assess in the
 setting of substantial adjacent pleural effusion and atelectasis, and
 attention to this region on a followup radiograph or CT is recommended.  A
 nonspecific opacity at the left lung base has decreased in extent in the
 interval, and the exam is otherwise unchanged considering differences in lung
 volumes.
