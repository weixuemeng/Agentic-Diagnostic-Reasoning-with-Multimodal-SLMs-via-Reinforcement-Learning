                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest tube  // Eval for chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A large right pleural effusion is without substantial interval change from the
 previous radiograph.  There is been interval placement of a right basilar
 chest tube with tip projecting over the medial right base.  There is
 persistent right basilar opacification likely reflective of atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Streaky left basilar opacity is re- demonstrated. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of right basilar chest tube without substantial
 interval change in size of large right pleural effusion.
 2.  Persistent right basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
 3.  Streaky left basilar opacity previously reflective on CT of chronic
 aspiration.
