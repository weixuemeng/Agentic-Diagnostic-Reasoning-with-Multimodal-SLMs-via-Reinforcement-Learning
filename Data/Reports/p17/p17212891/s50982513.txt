                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 932  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with oxygen requirement, question pleural
 effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 734.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 9:32 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.  A right internal
 jugular introducer catheter has its tip in the proximal SVC near the
 confluence with the brachiocephalic vein.  There continues to be a right
 pleural effusion and probably a smaller left effusion with patchy bibasilar
 airspace opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis.  Overall, the pulmonary
 edema has substantially improved with minimal residual interstitial component
 at this time.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
