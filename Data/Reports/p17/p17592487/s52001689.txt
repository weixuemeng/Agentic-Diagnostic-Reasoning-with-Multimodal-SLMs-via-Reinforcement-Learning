                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of IV drug use with recent
 overdose, hepatitis-C, and known cavitary lung lesion likely secondary to
 untreated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of a drug overdose.  Evaluate
 known cavitary lung lesion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left upper lobe cavitary lesion likely reflects a lung abscess secondary to
 untreated aspiration pneumonia; however, the differential also includes
 tuberculosis and septic embolus.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.
 Normal pleural surfaces.  No acute pneumonia, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left upper lobe cavitary lesion likely reflects a lung abscess secondary to
 untreated aspiration pneumonia, but tuberculosis must be ruled out.
