 ventricle, and coronary sinus.  A tubular structure projects over the right
 hemithorax.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.  Previously seen bilateral pleural effusions have
 resolved in the interval.  Mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is grossly stable.  Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulder and
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
