                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypotension  // evidence of pneumonia or
 effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Bilateral, right greater than left, lower lobe opacities most
 likely represent atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 vascular stent projects over the trachea at the level of the clavicles. The
 trachea is deviated to the right.  Enlargement of the mediastinal and cardiac
 contours may be due to technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than left,
 most likely represent atelectasis.
 
 Deviation of the trachea to the right may indicate an enlarged thyroid.
