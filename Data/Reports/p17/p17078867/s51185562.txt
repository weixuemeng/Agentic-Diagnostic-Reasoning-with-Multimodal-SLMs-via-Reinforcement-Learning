                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, confusion  // eval pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. Cardiac silhouette
 size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal contour is similar. There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Bilateral pleural thickening is more
 pronounced on the left and compatible with mesothelioma, better demonstrated
 on the most recent CT.  Consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe may
 reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax or new focal consolidation is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the previous CT. Persistent bilateral
 pleural thickening, worse on the left, compatible with mesothelioma. Mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion with left lower lobe consolidative opacity
 potentially atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
