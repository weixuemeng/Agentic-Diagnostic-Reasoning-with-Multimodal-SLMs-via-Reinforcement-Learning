                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and upper back pain  // infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Mild enlargement of
 the heart is present. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Small
 left pleural effusion is noted with associated left basilar opacity likely
 reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural
 effusion is present.  Degenerative changes are seen in the imaged thoracic
 spine.  Deformity of the right third rib likely reflects an old healed
 fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion with associated left basilar opacity likely
 reflecting atelectasis, although infection is difficult to exclude.
