                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man.  Evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with chest CT from
 ___
 
 Left pleural abnormality is largely in the lower hemithorax with smooth
 margins interfacing with the left lung.  The precise contribution of pleural
 thickening and pleural effusion is indeterminate, but the overall volume is
 comparable to that on the chest CT scan in ___ performed in another
 hospital.  Both lungs are clear.  There are healed rib fractures on the right.
 Leftward mediastinal shift reflects the restrictive nature of left pleural
 thickening inducing loss of volume in the left lung.  Right lung is clear.
