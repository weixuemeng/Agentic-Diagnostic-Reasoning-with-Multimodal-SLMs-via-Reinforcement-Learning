                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, lower extremity edema
 1 week after cesarean section.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged compared to the prior study.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Streaky opacity at the right lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis.  There are no acute osseous findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in size of the heart, likely related to recent pregnancy. 
 No pulmonary edema or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Minimal right
 basilar atelectasis.
