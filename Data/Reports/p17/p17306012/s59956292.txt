                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Peritoneal carcinoma with decreased breath sounds on the right.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development
 of a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  The area of increased
 opacification at the right base medially appears to have essentially cleared
 with some mild residual that may reflect fibrous scarring.  The left lung is
 essentially clear except for some atelectatic changes.  Upper zones are clear
 and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.  The Port-A-Cath remains in
 place.
