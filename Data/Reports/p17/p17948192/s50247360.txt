 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dense, rounded, 2.3 x 2.2 cm opacity seen adjacent to

 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The lungs are noted to be hyperinflated. 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiologic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  2.3 x 2.2 cm rounded opacity overlying the right upper lobe.  This may

 costochondral junction.
