                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right VATS and chest
 tube removal.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 After removal of the right chest tube, there is no definitive pneumothorax
 demonstrated.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Substantial lucency in
 the left upper lung represented by large bulla is redemonstrated.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.
