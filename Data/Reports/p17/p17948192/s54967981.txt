                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:50 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after right upper lobectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Postoperative right lung is well inflated.  Air in the pleural space is
 minimal.  Rounded contour to the right hilus, presumably due to vascular
 augmentation or small hematoma.
 
 The left lower lobe is substantially consolidated.  It is early for pneumonia.
 This could be post-reexpansion edema if that lobe was collapsed during
 surgery, but possibility of aspiration should be considered.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
