                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests a small new effusion, with
 none identifiable on the right side.  Streaky basilar opacity seen posteriorly
 are suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, lungs appear clear.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small pleural effusion on the left only.
