                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Reevaluate left rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again identified are nondisplaced rib fractures of the left
 posterior second through sixth ribs.  Since the prior radiograph, there has
 been no significant change.  No evidence of callus formation is yet seen.  The
 osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Stable bibasilar interstitial
 opacifications reflect the patient's known pulmonary fibrosis.  A small amount
 of atelectasis is noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged
 and stable from prior exams.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable appearance of the left second through sixth rib fractures.
 2.  Stable bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis.
