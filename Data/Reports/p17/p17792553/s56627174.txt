                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tachycardia, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study is available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are slightly hyperexpanded with early findings of COPD. 
 There is a rounded relative hyperlucency projecting over the left lateral mid
 lung field, which likely corresponds to a thin-walled cyst on the PET-CT of
 ___.  There are coarse interstitial lung markings predominantly in
 the bilateral lung bases.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal in size.  A density projecting over the left heart on the frontal view
 with no correlate on the lateral view likely represents a dense costochondral
 calcification.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings compatible with COPD with mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
 2.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
