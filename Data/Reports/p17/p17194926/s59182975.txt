                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  No free air is seen
 beneath the diaphragm.  The upper edge of the right hemithorax lies slightly
 above the left, ? positional.  Visualized osseous structures are otherwise
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  No acute pulmonary process identified. 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change in the appearance
 of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
