                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent hospitalizations, cough, and increasing abdominal
 distention.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA, ___ and chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
 replacement.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is diffusely calcified. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs are hyperinflated
 with relative lucency within the lung apices, compatible with emphysema. 
 Previously described nodular opacities on CT are not well demonstrated on the
 current radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  Multiple compression deformities of the thoracic spine are
 unchanged as well as old bilateral rib deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Emphysema. 
 Previously noted nodular opacities seen on CT not clearly visualized on the
 current radiograph.
