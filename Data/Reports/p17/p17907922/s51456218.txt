 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little change in the degree
 of small left apical pneumothorax with the pigtail catheter in place.  The
 left basilar opacification has decreased.  Although this could reflect
 improved aeration in decreased effusion, it may merely be a manifestation of a
 more upright position of the patient.
