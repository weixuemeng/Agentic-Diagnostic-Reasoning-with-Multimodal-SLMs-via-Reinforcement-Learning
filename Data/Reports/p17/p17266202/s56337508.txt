                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Findings suggest
 non-displaced fracture of the right lateral ninth rib with callus.  Seventh
 and eighth rib fractures were apparent on the recent prior radiographs but not
 as well depicted on these.  These are probably subacute or older in age.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Non-displaced right-sided rib fractures, probably subacute or older in age. 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease
