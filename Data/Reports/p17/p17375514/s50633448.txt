                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and cough  // r/o infiltrate      r/o
 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive heterogeneous opacification has developed in both lungs, most severe
 in the left upper lobe, particularly the lingula, much lower in volume in the
 lower lobes.  Minimal left pleural effusion is probably clinically
 insignificant.  There is no good evidence for central adenopathy.  Heart size
 is normal.
 
 Although nonspecific, the involvement of more than one lobe is sometimes an
 indication of an atypical organism such as Legionella.  There is also the
 suggestion of cavitation in the upper aspect of the lingular component.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 4:03 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
