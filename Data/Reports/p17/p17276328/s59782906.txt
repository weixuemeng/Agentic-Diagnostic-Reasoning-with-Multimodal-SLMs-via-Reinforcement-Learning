                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with chest wall pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  Post-traumatic deformity appears unchanged along the
 proximal left humerus.  As noted previously, there is a recent left distal
 clavicle fracture.  In addition, on this study, irregular nondisplaced lucency
 in the medial left clavicular head are consistent with a fracture, although
 these are similar and retrospect to a recent prior CT of the cervical spine
 from ___, although hard to visualize on recent prior dedicated left
 shoulder radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Non-displaced fractures of the
 proximal and distal portions of the clavicle, but not significantly changed.
