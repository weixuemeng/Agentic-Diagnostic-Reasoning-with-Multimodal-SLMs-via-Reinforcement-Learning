                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall with head strike.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  No atherosclerotic calcifications are
 noted within the aortic arch.  Lungs are hyperexpanded but clear.  Airways are
 well calcified.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.  Mild mid
 thoracic central vertebral compression deformities.  Anterior osteophyte
 formation evident.  No displaced rib fractures identified.  Incompletely
 assessed deformity of the left humeral head likely reflects prior trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute process.
