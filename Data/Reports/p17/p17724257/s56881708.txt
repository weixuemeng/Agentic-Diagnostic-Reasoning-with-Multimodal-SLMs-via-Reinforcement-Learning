                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M with ESRD s/p transplant in ___, CAD s/p CABG, DM c/b
 neuropathy, CHF with EF ___%, hyperparathyroidism s/p resection of ___ glands
 on ___ sent in by PCP after found to be in acute on chronic renal failure
 with Cr 7.2 (from 4.3 on ___).  // Please assess for rib fractures (recent
 compressions), and pulmonary edema, evidence of decompensating heart failure
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___,  no definite change is detected. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Sternotomy wires again
 noted. Platelike atelectasis at the left base with an elevated left
 hemidiaphragm is again noted, though with gas now seen beneath the left
 hemidiaphragm, with in the gastric fundus.  No CHF or frank consolidation is
 identified. No gross effusion. Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 posteriorly could be new.
 
 No displaced rib fractures are detected on these lung-technique films. 
 Correlation with any specific site of symptoms and, if indicated, dedicated
 rib radiographs could help for further assessment. No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Possible slight blunting of both costophrenic angles posteriorly, which
 could be new. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 2. No displaced rib fracture detected. Please see comment above.
