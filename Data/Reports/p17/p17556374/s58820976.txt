                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The lung volumes
 are markedly low, limiting evaluation for pulmonary edema.  Allowing for
 technical limitations, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Osseous
 structures are normal.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
