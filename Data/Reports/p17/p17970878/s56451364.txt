 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The low lung volumes accentuate the
 cardiac silhouette.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is
 adjacent atelectasis in the left base. Chest tubes project over the left
 hemithorax. There is no definite pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous emphysema has not
 changed significantly over the interval. A right-sided internal jugular
 central venous line and the distal SVC.  Median sternotomy wires are in place.
 Subcutaneous gas is present in the bilateral supraclavicular soft tissues.
