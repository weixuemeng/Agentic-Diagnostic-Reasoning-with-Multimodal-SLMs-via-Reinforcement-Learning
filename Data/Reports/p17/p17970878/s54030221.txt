                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // eval for pneumo
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The previously described left apical
 pneumothorax is not definitely identified.  Air outlining the left pectoral
 muscle is unchanged. A left-sided PleurX catheter is present. There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, which have decreased
 over the interval. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The previously described left apical pneumothorax is not definitely
 identified.
