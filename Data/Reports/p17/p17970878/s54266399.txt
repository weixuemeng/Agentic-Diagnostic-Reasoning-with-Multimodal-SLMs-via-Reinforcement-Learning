                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p left ptx with ct in place  // eval for ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the previously described apical
 pneumothorax is not definitely identified.  The pectoral this is less
 prominent than on the previous study.  Left chest tube remains in place and
 there is continued opacification at the bases consistent with small pleural
 effusions and compressive atelectasis. Some indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
