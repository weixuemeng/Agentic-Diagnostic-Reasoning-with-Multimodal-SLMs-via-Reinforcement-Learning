                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Shortness of breath, desaturation, status post
 cholecystectomy.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and very tortuous aorta are unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities are new; this could be due to atelectasis and/or
 aspiration.  Minimal opacities in the left perihilar region also could be due
 to atelectasis or aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusions. 
 Scoliosis is again noted.
