                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ year old man, status post aortic valve replacement, AVR,
 evaluation for consolidation or atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared with chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show moderate lung volumes with
 stable opacity of the left lung base, likely due to a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia
 should be considered, especially in light of progressive worsening of this
 area since ___.  Right IJ catheter is unchanged with tip in mid-low
 SVC.  Heart size is stably enlarged in patient who has had sternotomy for
 cardiac surgery.  Widening of the vascular pedicle is stable and might be a
 sign of central venous distention.  Right lung is overall clear except for
 minimal right lung base atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Cannot exclude left basilar pneumonia
