 HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation, previously seen pneumonia.  Evaluate for pneumonia
 or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates severe cardiomegaly and
 increased vascular congestion.  Asymmetrically increased opacity of the left
 mid lung is again noted, and may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema versus a
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased vascular congestion.  
 
 2. Unchanged asymmetrically increased opacity of the left mid lung, which
 again may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema versus a focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.
