                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased oxygen demand and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  none
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is severely enlarged.  There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. 
 There is an alveolar infiltrate in the left mid lung.  It is difficult to
 assess for small effusions giving overlying soft tissue.  Abnormalities are
 seen in the right shoulder likely due to old trauma and degenerative changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. CHF.
 
 2. Focal infiltrate in the left mid lung likely represents pneumonia although
 an asymmetric presentation of pulmonary edema cannot be totally excluded.
