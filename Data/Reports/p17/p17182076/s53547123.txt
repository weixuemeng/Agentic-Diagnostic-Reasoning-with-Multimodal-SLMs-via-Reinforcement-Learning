 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung severely hyperinflated but clear of focal abnormalities.  No pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema, and no pleural effusion.  Heart is normal size.  Lateral view
 shows heavy atherosclerotic coronary calcification and calcification at the
 origin of the head and neck vessels and descending thoracic aorta.  Possible
 aortic valvular calcification is partially obscured.
 
 Left upper quadrant tubing is probably a gastric feeding tube, tip at the
 level of the gastric fundus, but not definitively localized in the absence of
 a gastric air bubble.
