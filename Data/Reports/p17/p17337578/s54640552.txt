                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  Additional patchy areas of opacities
 are seen in the mid lungs bilaterally, which could in part relate to edema;
 however, areas of infection may be present.  There is slight prominence of the
 central pulmonary vasculature.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta is slightly tortuous.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  Additional areas of small patchy opacity in
 the mid lungs bilaterally, right greater than left, foci of infection not
 excluded.
