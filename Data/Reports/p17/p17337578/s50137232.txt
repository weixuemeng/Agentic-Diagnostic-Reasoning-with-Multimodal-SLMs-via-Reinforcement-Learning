                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral pleural effusions and possible
 pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Increased opacity silhouetting
 the right heart border is compatible with infection.  Numerous additional
 smaller focal opacities are widely distributed and consistent with multifocal
 infection.  Persistent blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is consistent
 with moderate pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Top-normal heart size
 appears stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased right middle lobe consolidation with persistent widespread smaller
 focal opacities, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.
