                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and resolving
 cholangitis. Status post Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi upright chest radiograph.  Recently placed a Dobbhoff
 feeding tube is curled within the esophagus with tip directed superiorly
 located the level of the clavicular heads.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter is unchanged in position.  
 
 Dense left basal consolidation and milder right opacities are slightly
 increased from the previous examination along with unchanged left
 mild-to-moderate pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Previously administered contrast again
 noted in the stomach.  Descending aortic vascular calcifications are moderate
 in severity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube is curled within the esophagus.  At the time of dictation, a
 ___ radiograph had already been obtained which demonstrated satisfactory
 position of the tube.
 
 2.  Slight interval worsening of bibasilar opacities over the short interval
 likely reflects hypoventilation with accompanying mild to moderate left
 pleural effusion.
