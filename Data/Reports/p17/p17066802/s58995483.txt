                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:05 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with continued shortness of breath.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved substantially.  Opacification
 in both lower lobes persists, particularly the left, which is severely, if not
 entirely atelectatic.  Moderate left pleural effusion has increased. 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe and unchanged.  Right jugular line is
 central.  An upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view, but oral contrast agent is still collected in the stomach.  If barium
 contrast agent was used, it may be becoming inspissated, although this is
 usually not a problem in the stomach.
