                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:49 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 4:49 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric
 tube are in unchanged in position.  There continues to be a layering left
 effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity which may reflect an area of
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  In
 addition, there is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity
 which suggests worsening interstitial edema.  Focal linear opacities in the
 left mid and upper lungs may represent areas of subsegmental atelectasis or
 possibly scarring given the lack of interval change since ___.  No large
 pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
