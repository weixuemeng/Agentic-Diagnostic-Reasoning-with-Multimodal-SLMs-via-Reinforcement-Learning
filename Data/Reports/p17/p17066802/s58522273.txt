                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 17:16
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with viral peritonitis status post
 exploratory laparotomy and ERCP, confirm esophageal balloon placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 10:58.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest from ___ at 17:16 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip coursing below the diaphragm and
 obscured by some contrast, which is seen within the stomach.  Right internal
 jugular central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC.  An
 endotracheal tube is identified with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the
 carina.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects a
 combination of layering effusion with compressive atelectasis, although a
 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is persistent but
 improving interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated on this
 semi-erect study.  Calcification of the aorta is consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  Heart remains stably enlarged.
