                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Sepsis, new central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 right internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip of the catheter projects over
 the mid to low SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other
 complications.  The patient is rotated, causing a projection induced increase
 in radiodensity at the left lung bases.  Otherwise, the radiograph is
 unchanged.  The previously seen skin folds projecting over the left hemithorax
 are no longer visualized.
