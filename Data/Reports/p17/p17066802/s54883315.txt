                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:48 A.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater opacification has developed at both lung bases, presumably
 atelectasis, but raising concern for aspiration.  Accompanying the lung
 findings are small pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Previous
 severe subcutaneous emphysema traceable to surgery has nearly resolved.  There
 is no pneumothorax or appreciable pneumomediastinum.  The heart is probably
 enlarged.
