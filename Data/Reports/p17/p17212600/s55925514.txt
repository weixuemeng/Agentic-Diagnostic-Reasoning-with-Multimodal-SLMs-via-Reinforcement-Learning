 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for relatively low lung volumes, heart is upper limits of

 surfaces are clear.  A slight leftward deviation of trachea could potentially
 represent enlargement of right lobe of the thyroid gland.  No acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with no acute
 cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormalities.
