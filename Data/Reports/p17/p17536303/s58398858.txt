                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe systolic heart failure, on
 amiodarone, increasing shortness of breath.  // ?amiodarone toxicity or
 pulmonary edema     ?amiodarone toxicity or pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is no longer enlarged.  Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Previous
 pleural effusions and mild dependent edema have resolved.  Two trans
 subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads and  a right atrial
 pacer lead are in apparently contiguous from the left pectoral generator to
 their respective locations.  Presumably one of the ventricular leads is
 orphaned, but I cannot see the connections.
