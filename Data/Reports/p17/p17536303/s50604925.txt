                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with CP s/p pacemaker exchange  // PTX?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest wall pacing device is again seen with leads in unchanged positions,
 2 at the right ventricular apex and 1 in the right atrium.  The lungs are
 clear without consolidation, effusion, edema or pneumothorax.  There is a
 nodular opacity seen in the retrocardiac region on the lateral view just
 anterior to the the midportion of a lower thoracic vertebral body.  It
 measures approximately 1.5 cm and may localize to the left on the frontal
 view, abutting the cardiac margin.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Coronary artery stent is noted.  Hypertrophic changes are
 noted in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process, no pneumothorax.
 A 1.5 cm nodule seen on the lateral view, likely within the left lung on the
 frontal view.  Followup nonurgent chest CT is suggested.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Nonurgent chest CT for evaluation of suspected 1.5 mm
 pulmonary nodule.
