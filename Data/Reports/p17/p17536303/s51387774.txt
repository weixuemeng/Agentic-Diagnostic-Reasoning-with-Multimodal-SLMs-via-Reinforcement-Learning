 FINDINGS:  ICD pacing device is unchanged in position.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged, but pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Small right and
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are new along with adjacent bibasilar
 lung opacities most likely due to atelectasis, although infectious
 consolidation is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
