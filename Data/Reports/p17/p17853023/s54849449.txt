                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening/scarring is noted.  Slight increase
 in prominence of interstitial markings diffusely bilaterally could reflect
 interstitial disease.  The heart is normal in size and unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Prominence of interstitial markings perhaps age-related or reflective of a
 chronic lung disease.  No focal consolidation or overty pulmonary edema.
