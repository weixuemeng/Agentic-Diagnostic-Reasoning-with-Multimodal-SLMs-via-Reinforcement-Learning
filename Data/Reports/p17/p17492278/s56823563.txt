                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea and cough for three days.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. A 10mm small
 density projecting over the right lower lung without a correlate on the
 lateral view may represent confluence of shadows, but a small infectious focus
 cannot be excluded. The remainder of the lungs is clear. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Left volume loss after left lower lobectomy is
 similar to the prior study. Increased interstitial markings suggest chronic
 lung disease with emphysema as seen on CT. Bi-apical scarring is unchanged. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION: New tiny opacity projecting over the right lower lung is likely
 confluence of shadows, but a tiny infectious focus cannot be excluded.
 Recommend follow up radiographs after treatment.
