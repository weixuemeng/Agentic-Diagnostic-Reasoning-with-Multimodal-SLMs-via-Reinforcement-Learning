                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CHF, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary
 hypertension, afib on xarelto with several hours gradual shortness of breath
 this AM. From OSH, mild edema and right effusion on CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution suggestive of
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  More focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.  There appears to be background
 hyperinflation suggestive of underlying COPD.  11 mm nodular opacity projects
 over the right upper lung field.  There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely
 compressive atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
 3. 11 mm right upper lobe nodular opacity.  Correlation with nonemergent CT is
 recommended for further assessment.
