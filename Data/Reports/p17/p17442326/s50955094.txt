                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with thoracotomy and thymectomy, now with
 chest tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 likely secondary to poor inspiration.  Bilateral pleural effusions are seen,
 as well as some bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is some slight
 opacification at the right heart border which may be atelectasis, but in the
 appropriate clinical setting could also be concerning for pneumonia. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Sternotomy wires are again noted. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Medial right lung base opacity
 could be concerning for pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
