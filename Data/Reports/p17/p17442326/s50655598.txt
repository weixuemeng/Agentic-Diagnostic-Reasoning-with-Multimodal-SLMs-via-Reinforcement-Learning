 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post sternotomy and radical

 Heart size is mildly enlarged, possibly related to postoperative pericardial

 acute pulmonary infiltrates.  The lateral pleural sinus remains free, where as
 the left-sided basal pleural densities have regressed.  The posterior pleural
 sinuses remain free bilaterally.  On the left base, the pleural densities have
 regressed.  Improving aeration of the left lower lobe is noted.  A loculated
 pulmonary thickening remains laterally and extends into a remaining thickening
 of the major fissure.  No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen and no
 pneumothorax can be identified on either right or left apical area.
