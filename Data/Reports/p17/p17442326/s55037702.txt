                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thymectomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is less opacification
 at the bases and better definition of the hemidiaphragm.  However, on lateral
 view, there are again substantial bilateral pleural effusions, which suggest
 their appearance related to differences in patient position.
 
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
