                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman status post left VATS with washout, now post-chest
 tube pull, to rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Opacities in bilateral lower lobes, left
 greater than right, are likely due to atelectasis. There is also a component
 of pleural effusion on the left.  Previous chest tube has been removed and
 there is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal clips as well as median sternotomy
 wires are intact.  Abdominal surgical clips represent post-cholecystectomy
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax status post chest tube removement.
