                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Metastatic ovarian cancer, admitted for abdominal pain, please
 evaluate for cause of new hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours.  Heart borders are
 obscured by a minimally increased left lower lung opacity, likely a
 combination of atelectasis and a moderate left pleural effusion.  Right lower
 lung opacification is likely related to known large right lower lung lesion
 thought to represent metastatic disease.  Stable blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, likely represents small pleural effusion versus scarring. 
 Newly evident nodular opacification in the left mid lung without correlate on
 the ___ CT may represent additional metastatic deposit.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Relatively unchanged exam, though new focal nodularity projecting
 over the left mid lung may represent additional metastatic deposit.
