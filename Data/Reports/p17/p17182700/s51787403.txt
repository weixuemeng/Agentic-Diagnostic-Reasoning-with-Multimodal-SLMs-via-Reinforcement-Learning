                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.  Selected images from an
 abdominopelvic CT study dated ___.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity which may reflect a combination
 of a layering effusion with compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot
 be entirely excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Rounded opacity at the
 right base is unchanged and is felt to correspond to the pleural-based mass
 seen on the recent CT study consistent with metastatic disease.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The previously reported
 lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum is not well appreciated on the plain film
 study.  A right subclavian Port-A-Cath with its tip unchanged in the distal
 SVC.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.  More focal nodularity in the left
 mid lung is again seen but less well visualized than on the prior study of
 ___.
