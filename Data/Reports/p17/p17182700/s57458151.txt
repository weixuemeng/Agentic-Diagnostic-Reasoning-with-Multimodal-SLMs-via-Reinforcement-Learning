 presenting with leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, and CT torso from
 ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates
 in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  A large rounded opacity within the
 right lung base is better characterized on recent prior CT and corresponds
 with known metastatic disease.  Known subcarinal lymph nodes are not well
 characterized on this chest radiograph examination.  The remainder of the
 lungs appear clear.  There is no new focal consolidation or pneumothorax. 
 There is no vascular congestion or large pleural effusions.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Surgical clips are seen within
 the right hilum and are unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Unchanged right lung base mass corresponding with known metastatic disease.
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
