                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with reported history of positive PPD.  Needs to
 evaluate tuberculosis status for work.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 imaging.
 
 Lungs are fully expanded.  The only pulmonary abnormality is a possible
 sub-4-mm nodule in the right lung at the level of the fourth anterior rib,
 which alternatively could be a small region of sclerosis in that rib or a
 composite shadow.  Lungs are, otherwise, clear.  There is no pleural
 abnormality or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible sub-4-mm right lung nodule.  Suggest repeat conventional
 chest radiographs in six months.  If the finding persists or there is the
 possibility of growth, additional imaging would be indicated at that time.
 
 The findings were posted to the online record of critical radiology findings
 for direct notification of the referring physician.
