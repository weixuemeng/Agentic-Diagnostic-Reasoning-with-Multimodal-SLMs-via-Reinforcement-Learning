                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/bilateral scapular pain  // ___M w/bilateral scapular pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Focal opacity in left posterior costophrenic sulcus may reflect an area of
 atelectasis, scarring or pleural thickening; a mass is less likely. 
 Comparison to remote studies would be helpful.  In their absence, followup
 imaging with a PA and lateral chest radiograph in ___ months to assess for
 stability would be prudent.  Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Diffuse osteopenia is noted.  No
 displaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Focal opacity in the left posterior costophrenic sulcus as described above. 
 Comparison to remote studies would be advised.  In their absence, followup
 radiograph in ___ months would be prudent.  Clinical correlation is also
 recommended.
