 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:37 AM
  Disregard prior wet read. Erroneous patient and exam.
 WET READ VERSION #1 
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ ___ 1:25 AM
  There is a heterogeneously appearing collection in the anterior portion of the
  gallbladder fossa where the JP drain is present with locules of gas that
  appear extraluminal and not related to adjacent bowel, suggesting infection of
  this collection. The JP drain barely enters the collection.
  
  No extraluminal contrast or extensive gas to suggest bowel perforation.
  Hepaticojejunostomy appears intact and there is no bowel thickening.
  Pneumobilia is expected after hepaticojejunostomy. No other organized fluid
  collection in the abdomen.
  
  Small non hemorrhagic ascites. BIolateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
  atelectasis.
  
  2 cm fluid collection in the central prostate may represent urethrocele. Foley
  in place.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male intubated, transferred from outside institution.
 Evaluate tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A moderate right pneumothorax is obscured by heavy subcutaneous emphysema in
 the right chest wall extending into the neck and axilla; the mediastinum is
 not shifted, despite presumed postive pressure ventilation from an
 endotracheal tube ending 2 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube ends at
 the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced at least 12cm to
 move all the sideports into the stomach that is currently massively distended
 with air, quite likely interfering with expansion of the chest.
 
 Both lungs are densely consolidated, the right lung diffusely and the left
 predominantly at the base; contributions from atelectasis, aspiration, edemas,
 and even hemorrhage, cannot be assigne. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. The
 mediastinum is not appreciably widened. Pleural effusions are presumed, but
 not appreciable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax, explains subcutaneous emphysema. Has there
 been an attempted central line placement? Mediastinum is neither shifted nor
 widened.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Esophageal tube should be
 advanced to decompress severely distended stomach.
 
 These findings which vary considerably from those of the original dictation by
 Dr ___ at 1:25am, transcribed at 2:22am, were discussed at length
 by Drs. ___ ___ ___ between 8 and ___am.
