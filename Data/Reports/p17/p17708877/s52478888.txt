                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widening of the right mediastinal stripe reflects known lymphadenopathy. The
 heart is mildly enlarged. There is new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 not specific although a possible cause is a subpulmonic effusion although not
 explicitly demonstrated. There is, however, indication of a very small pleural
 effusion on the left with patchy retrocardiac opacity, which is mostly
 frequently due to atelectasis. Lung volumes are low.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy new retrocardiac opacity although more likely to represent atelectasis
 than pneumonia. Probable small effusion on the left. New elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm, not specific; among other possible causes a subpulmonic
 effusion could yield this appearance. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Standard PA
 and lateral radiographs may be useful to reassess if needed clinically.
