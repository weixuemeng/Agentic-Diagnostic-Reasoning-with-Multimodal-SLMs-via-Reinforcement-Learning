                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with non-small cell lung
 cancer and multiple pulmonary nodules, altered mental status, thus suspicion
 for pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral radiograph of the chest were reviewed.
 
 There is no change in the appearance of the right upper lobe mass and multiple
 pulmonary nodules.  No new consolidation demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax seen.
