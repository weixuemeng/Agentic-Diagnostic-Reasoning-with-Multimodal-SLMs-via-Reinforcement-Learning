                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been substantial interval improvement of
 bilateral consolidations with only minimal atelectasis seen on the left and
 presence of minimal amount of left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
 Upper lungs are clear.  The right central venous line tip terminates at the
 level of mid SVC.  Overall, no abnormality that can potentially explain
 patient's symptoms are currently demonstrated.  More chronic changes seen in
 the lung bases.
