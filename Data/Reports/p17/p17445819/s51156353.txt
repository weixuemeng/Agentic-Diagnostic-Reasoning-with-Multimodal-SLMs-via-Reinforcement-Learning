                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with relapsed AML and febrile neutropenia  //
 Infiltrate      Infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval changes are mild, consisting of more peribronchial opacification in
 the right lower lobe.  In the setting of a patient with febrile neutropenia
 this could be early pneumonia.  Unfortunately confirmation with CT scanning
 would be much more reliable.  Pleural effusion is minimal if any probably not
 significant.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
 
 Right transjugular infusion port catheter ends in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
