 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, AML and fever.  // ? infiltrate     
 ? infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 13 49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 00:31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right subclavian central line is unchanged position. Overall cardiac and 
 mediastinal contours are stable.  A few streaky linear opacities at both bases
 most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal airspace consolidation
 is seen to suggest pneumonia.  A curvilinear line in the left upper lung is
 felt to be related to clothing or sheets as it does appear matched pulmonary
 markings extend beyond the line making pneumothorax unlikely.  Followup
 imaging, however, would be advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large
 effusions.
