                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pericardial drain placement following right
 ventricular puncture during AICD placement.  Now with worsening hypotension
 and hypoxemia.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates unchanged
 position of dual-lead AICD, with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The cardiac size is unchanged since the prior study, and
 there is a new pericardial drain in place.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacification is likely due to atelectasis, and increased bilateral
 interstitial markings reflect mild underlying edema. Bilateral reticular
 opacities are unchanged due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, along with
 stable left apical scarring.  There is no pneumothorax.  The proximal
 esophagus is distended with air, possible due to dysmotility.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Mild acute interstitial edema.
 2. Increased left retrocardiac opacity, likley atelectasis.
 3. Distended proximal esophagus, possibly due to dysmotility. Consider barium
 study if esophageal symptoms are present.
