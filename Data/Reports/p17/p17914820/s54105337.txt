                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval improvement in heterogeneous lung opacities, which may
 have represented acute pulmonary edema superimposed upon more chronic lung
 disease.  A focal opacity in the left retrocardiac region has slightly
 improved, and a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Asymmetrical
 biapical thickening is again demonstrated, left greater than right, similar in
 appearance to ___ radiograph.  Calcifications along the right
 hemidiaphragm pleural surface are also unchanged.  Within the imaged portion
 of the upper abdomen, incompletely imaged distended loops of bowel are
 present, and could be more fully assessed by dedicated abdominal radiographs
 if warranted clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Rapid improvement in heterogeneous lung opacities, which may have represented
 acute pulmonary edema superimposed upon chronic lung disease. 
 
 Improving left retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to atelectasis, but
 continued followup is suggested to document complete resolution and to exclude
 a lung nodule or mass in this area.
