                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stroke, decreased responsiveness  // eval
 for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC terminates in the lower SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette including
 moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is increased density over the right
 base the lung markings only seen medially.  This could represent a moderate
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis; however, right lower lobe collapse
 and eventration of right hemidiaphragm also possible. Atelectasis at the left
 base has decreased. Barium from a prior study is seen in the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No substantial change in the right lower lung opacification which may be
 related to an moderate-sized effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, a
 collapsed right lower lobe cannot be excluded.
 2. Improved atelectasis at the left base.
