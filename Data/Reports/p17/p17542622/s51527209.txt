                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Minimal linear opacity within the left lung
 base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  A 4 mm nodular opacity within the
 left lung apex appears calcified, and likely reflects a granuloma.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
