 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Inability to protect airways, endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube still projects 6 cm above the carina, the tube could be advanced by 1-2
 cm.  The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.  The pre-existing
 minimal opacities at the left lung apex is completely resolved.  There is no
 evidence of new parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion. 
 No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia or atelectasis.
