  There is still a moderate left pleural effusion. Increased vague opacification
  of the left hemi thorax may be secondary to posterior layering of pleural
  fluid. There is a persistent retrocardiac opacity which may represent
  atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical
  setting.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CNS lymphoma, s/p fall with right hip
 fracture. Known pleural effusion.  // pleural effusion     pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacification of the left hemithorax is consistent with layering pleural
 effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification suggests volume loss small left lower
 lobe. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 The right lung remains essentially clear.
