                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple myeloma and chemotherapy, presents with increasing cough.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a 1.6 x 2.9 cm focal, oval opacity at the base of the right lung,
 which most likely represents evolution of a lytic rib lesion, now with
 increased sclerosis.  The heart is mildly enlarged and the hilar contours are
 normal.  The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax. Also
 seen is a partial vertebroplasty along the right side of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body, unchanged in appearance.   
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right lower lung opacity most likely represents increasing sclerosis
 associated with a lytic rib lesion and possibly healing pathological fracture.
 
 
 2. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
