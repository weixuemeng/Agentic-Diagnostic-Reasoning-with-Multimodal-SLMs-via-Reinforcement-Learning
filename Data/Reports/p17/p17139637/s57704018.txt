                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient status post fall.  Evaluate for traumatic injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is limited due to rotated position, and supine view. 
 Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  No focal parenchymal
 opacities are identified.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No rib fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  No rib fracture
 identified.  Of note, this study has suboptimal sensitivity for assessment of
 rib fractures.  If there is further concern, dedicated rib cage views should
 be obtained.
