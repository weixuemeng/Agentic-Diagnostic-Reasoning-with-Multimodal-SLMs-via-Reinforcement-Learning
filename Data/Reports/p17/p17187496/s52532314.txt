                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right elbow fracture, preoperative assessment.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.  Degenerative changes are noted involving both acromioclavicular
 joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise
 demonstrated.
