                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity weakness with recent subdural hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___; ___; CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright views of the chest were obtained.  A right cardiac
 pacemaker obscures the right lung base. Low lung volumes result in
 bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. Left basilar atelectasis is seen. Pulmonary vasculature is
 engorged without overt pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette are
 unchanged with mild cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity.  Cardiac pacemaker
 leads are in satisfactory position.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
