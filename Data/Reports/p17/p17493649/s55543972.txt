                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and active smoking with decreased breath sounds at the left
 base.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change.
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with tortuosity of the
 aorta appearing.  The pacer and defibrillator leads remain in position.
 
 On the lateral view, there is suggestion of some increased opacification in
 the retrocardiac region anterior to the lower thoracic spine.  No definite
 correlation is seen to this finding on the frontal view.  The possibility of a
 developing consolidation would have to be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
