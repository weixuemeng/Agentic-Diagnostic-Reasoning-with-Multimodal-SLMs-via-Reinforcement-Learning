                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 right-sided AICD is again seen with lead extending to the expected position of
 the right atrium and right ventricle.  The patient is rotated to the right. 
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  The right costophrenic angle is not
 well assessed due to overlying battery pack; however, a small right pleural
 effusion may be present.  There is minimal central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No definite focal consolidation.
