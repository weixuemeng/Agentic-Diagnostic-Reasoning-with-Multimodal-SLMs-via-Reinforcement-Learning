                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some increased
 prominence of the cardiac silhouette with engorgement of indistinct pulmonary
 vessels, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles suggests some small effusions.
