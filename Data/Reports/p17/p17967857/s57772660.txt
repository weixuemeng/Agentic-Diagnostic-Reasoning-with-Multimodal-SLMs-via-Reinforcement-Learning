                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  IABP placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite pulmonary vascular
 congestion, raising the possibility of pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy.
 Swan-Ganz catheter from the right IJ approach extends well into the right
 pulmonary artery.  Tip of the IABP lies approximately halfway between the left
 main stem bronchus and the superior portion of the aortic arch.
 
 Otherwise, little change.
