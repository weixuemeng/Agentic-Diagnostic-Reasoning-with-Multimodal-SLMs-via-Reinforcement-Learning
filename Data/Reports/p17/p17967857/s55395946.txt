                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with mitral valve replacement with mitral regurgitation
 and mitral stenosis, cardiogenic shock, balloon pump.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The intra-aortic balloon pump ends 2.2 cm below the aortic knob and 1.8 cm
 above the left mainstem which is adequate but should not be higher. 
 Right-sided Swan-Ganz has been slightly pulled back and now ends in the right
 pulmonary artery.  Moderate pulmonary edema, more localized in the right upper
 lobe may be due to mitral valve regurgitation.  Prior sternotomy was done for
 mitral valve repair in this patient with significant cardiomegaly.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  New 18 mm very dense opacity is seen in
 the left upper quadrant, probably in the stomach which could represent
 ingested pill or even a tooth.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.  Intra-aortic balloon pump should
 not be higher.
 2.  Increase in moderate pulmonary edema more localized in the right upper
 lobe could reflect mitral valve regurgitation.
 3.  Probable ingested material in the stomach could be a pill but also a
 tooth.
 
 This has been discussed at 10:58 a.m. with nurse practitioner, ___. 
 The patient is in the OR right now and postop x-ray is planned.
