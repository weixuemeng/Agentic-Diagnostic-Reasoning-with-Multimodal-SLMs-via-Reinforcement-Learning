 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  There is increased ground-glass
 opacity throughout the lungs, consistent with worsening mild pulmonary edema. 
 There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Intra-aortic balloon pump has advanced since yesterday and should be
 repositioned 2 cm for better positioning.  
 2.  Pulmonary arterial catheter terminates in the descending right pulmonary

 pulmonary artery.  
 3.  Slight worsening of mild pulmonary edema.
