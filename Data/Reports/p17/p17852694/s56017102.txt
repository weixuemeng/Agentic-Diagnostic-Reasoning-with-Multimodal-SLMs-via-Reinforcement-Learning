 Widespread severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality has features suggesting
 some chronic lung disease, but there is moderate to severe cardiomegaly and
 small pleural effusions, so some of it may be due to acute pulmonary edema as
 well.  The lungs are hyperinflated and the lucencies in the upper lungs
 suggest emphysema.  No pneumothorax.
