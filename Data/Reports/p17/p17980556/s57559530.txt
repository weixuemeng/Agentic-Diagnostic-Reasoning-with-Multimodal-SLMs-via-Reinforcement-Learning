                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female, intubated at outside hospital for hypoxia. 
 Question tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending 4.1
 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular approach central venous
 catheter has tip in the low SVC.  The enteric tube extends into the stomach
 with side port near the GE junction.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but
 likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is a right-sided pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Dense retrocardiac opacity may represent
 dependent atelectasis.  There is generalized hazy appearance to the lungs.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Appropriate positioning of lines and tubes.
 2. Generalized hazy appearance to lungs, which could represent mild
 interstitial edema or atypical infection.  Correlate clinically.
