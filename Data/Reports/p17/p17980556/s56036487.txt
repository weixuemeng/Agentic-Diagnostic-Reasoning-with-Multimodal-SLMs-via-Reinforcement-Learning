                                 FINAL REPORT
 ABDOMEN, ___ 7:27 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  Intubated ___-year-old woman, evaluate NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP view of the abdomen centered at the L2 level shows a
 nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach would need to be advanced at
 least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. 
 The imaged portion of the intestinal tract is not distended.  The widespread
 but variable abnormality at the lung bases may have improved, suggesting this
 was edema.
