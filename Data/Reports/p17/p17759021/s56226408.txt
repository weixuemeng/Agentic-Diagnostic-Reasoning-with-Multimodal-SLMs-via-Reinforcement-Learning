 bronchovascular markings.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusions,
 or pneumothorax.  Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Heart
 size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities at the lung
 bases most likely represent atelectasis.  Partially imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
