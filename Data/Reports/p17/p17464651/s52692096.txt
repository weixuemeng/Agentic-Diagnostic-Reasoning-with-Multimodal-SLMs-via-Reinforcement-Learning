 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and diffusely
 calcified.  Hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema. 
 Within the left upper lobe is a 2.8 x 2.5 cm rounded opacity, new in the
 interval, concerning for a neoplastic mass.  Innumerable nodular opacities in
 the right mid lung field and both lung bases are also new.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Dextroscoliosis
 of the thoracic spine is again noted with mild degenerative changes.  Left
 axillary clips are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. 2.8 x 2.5 cm rounded mass in the left upper lobe concerning for neoplasm,
 new from the prior chest radiograph.  Further assessment with
 contrast-enhanced CT is recommended.
 2. Multiple new nodular opacities in both lung bases concerning for metastatic
 disease.  Infection/small airways disease is not completely excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  2.8 x 2.5 cm rounded mass in the left upper lobe
 concerning for neoplasm, new from the prior chest radiograph.  Further
