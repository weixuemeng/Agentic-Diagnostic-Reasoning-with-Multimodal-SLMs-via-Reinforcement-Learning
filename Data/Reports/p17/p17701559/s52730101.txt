                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fall onto right side
 10 days ago, increased pain, question rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Projecting
 over the right lung base, there is a 0.8 cm partially seen nodular opacity
 which most likely represents nipple shadow, which can be confirmed with repeat
 with nipple markers.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen. No definite rib fracture is seen; however, if clinical
 concern for rib fracture persists, suggest dedicated rib series.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base nodular opacity may represent nipple shadow which can
 be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers.  Otherwise, no evidence of acute
 intrathoracic process.  No definite rib fracture seen.  However, if clinical
 concern for rib fracture persists, recommend dedicated rib series, which is
 more sensitive.
