                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a past medical history of severe COPD, now
 presenting with worsening dyspnea over the past few days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial markings are noted, right greater than left. 
 Additionally, there is a right upper lobe opacity with mediastinal shift
 towards the right.  This is suggestive of underlying volume loss, possibly
 prior lobectomy changes.  However, if there is no history of surgery,
 underlying malignancy should be considered.  Superimposed post-obstructive
 pneumonia is possible.
 
 Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base.  No substantial pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe opacity and volume loss.  While this may reflect prior
 lobectomy change, there may be an underlying mass with possible
 post-obstructive pneumonia, and should be further investigated with CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with contrast for further evaluation of rightward
 mediastinal shift and right upper lobe opacity.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings and recommendations were telephoned to Dr.
 ___ by ___ on ___ at 11:15AM, approximately 10 minutes
 after attending readout.
