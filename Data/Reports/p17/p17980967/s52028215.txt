                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath while lying
 down, hypoxia and right lower lobe crackles, diminished breath sounds. 
 Evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Heart size is borderline, without typical
 configurational abnormality.  Thoracic aorta of normal ___ but with
 some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  There is some
 moderate degree of perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation, but there
 is no conclusive finding for central parenchymal or basal interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  Diffuse haze is overlying the lower half of the right
 hemithorax in the absence of any pleural fluid accumulation blunting the
 lateral pleural sinuses.  Considering patient's significant recumbent
 position, it is possible that this haze relates to pleural effusion layering
 in the posterior pleural compartment.  In the differential diagnosis, this
 density could of course also represent parenchymal infiltrates of inflammatory
 nature.  Review of the latest transferred chest examination from ___ dated ___ demonstrated similar findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable right-sided pleural effusion or parenchymal
 infiltrates in right lower lobe, difficult to differentiate on single portable
 chest view.  Recommended additional lateral view or new evaluation with chest
 CT.
