                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PLL on chemotherapy, persistent
 dyspnea/hypoxia, volume overloaded on exam.  // Eval for infiltrate, effusion,
 other pulmonary process.     Eval for infiltrate, effusion, other pulmonary
 process.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the layering pleural effusion on the
 frontal view on the right appears to have improved.  However, on the lateral
 view, there are still substantial pleural effusions bilaterally, so that the
 change on the frontal view merely represents the upright position of the
 patient.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
 No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Port-A-Cath is
 unchanged.
