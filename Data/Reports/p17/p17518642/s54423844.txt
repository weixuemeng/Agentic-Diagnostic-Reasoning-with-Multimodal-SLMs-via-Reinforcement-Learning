 This exam was also compared with a prior radiograph from ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated. 
 Pleuroparenchymal scarring in the apices, greater on the right side, and
 nodular opacities in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe are more
 conspicuous than in prior study as well as nodular opacities in the left mid
 lung.  There is a new ill-defined opacity in the left perihilar region.  All
 these abnormalities should be evaluated by CT.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
