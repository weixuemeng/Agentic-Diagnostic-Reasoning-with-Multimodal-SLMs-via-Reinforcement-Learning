                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Trauma
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An azygos lobe is incidentally noted.  There are low lung volumes.  Mild
 basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation.  There is central
 pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac
 mediastinal silhouettes are likely exaggerated by a supine, AP technique. 
 Thoracic spine fractures and sternal fracture better pain on subsequent CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Thoracic spine and sternal fractures
 better seen on the subsequent CT.
