                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness, concern infectious source
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA neck ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the lung apices is limited by the patient's neck and chin
 obscuring these regions.  Heart size is unchanged, appearing mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas
 of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or large
 pneumothorax is identified.  Fusion hardware within the lower cervical and
 upper thoracic spine is not completely assessed on this study.  Mild
 compression deformity of an upper/ mid thoracic vertebral body appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis.
