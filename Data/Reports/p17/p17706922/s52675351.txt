 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient's positioning between studies.  There has been interval
 appearance of mild pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities at both bases may also
 reflect a component of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Multiple surgical clips
 in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
