 the right.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are grossly stable.

 Bilateral areas of airspace opacity, right greater than left raise concern for
 multifocal pneumonia.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is also in the differential
 diagnosis.
 
 
 Elevated right hemidiaphragm with possible right pleural effusion.
