                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with productive material from tracheostomy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is compatible with underlying
 lymphadenopathy, unchanged, and better seen on the previous CT.  Hilar
 contours are similar and there is mild pulmonary edema, as seen previously. 
 Small right pleural effusion is likely present.  Patchy right basilar opacity
 could reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 unchanged position.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged moderate to severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and
 probable small right pleural effusion.  Patchy right basilar opacity may
 reflect atelectasis.  Tracheostomy appears unchanged.
