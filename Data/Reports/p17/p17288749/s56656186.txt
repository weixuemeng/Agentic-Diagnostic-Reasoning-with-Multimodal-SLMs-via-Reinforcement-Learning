                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o man with complex medical hx of T2 DM, RLD ___ obesity,
 pulmonary HTN, complex sleep d/o requiring bipap, tracheomalacia s/p trach in
 ___, CHF (EF ___%), and aflutter, presenting from clinic at request of PCP
 for progressive fatigue, dyspnea, and orthopnea.  // assess for pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low but similar when compared to the prior study.  The
 patient has known tracheostomy is difficult to visualize due to patient
 positioning on today's study.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary
 vascular structures and cardiomegaly, however there has been progressive
 opacification of the right lung base with air bronchograms and the appearances
 are suspicious for a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.  Probable
 right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, the
 extent of consolidation at the right lung base appears to have progressed when
 compared to the prior study.
