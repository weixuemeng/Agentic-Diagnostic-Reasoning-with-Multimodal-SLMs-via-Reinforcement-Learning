                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post trach with cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP portable upright radiograph demonstrates bilateral nodular opacities
 bilaterally about the hila are thought to reflect engorged central vessels. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged, stable allowing for differences in
 radiographic technique when compared to prior study. No pulmonary edema. There
 is no large pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Evaluation of the
 tracheostomy tube is limited secondary to overlying soft tissue density.
 Allowing for this, the tracheostomy appears in stable position when compared
 to prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis, superimposed infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting is possible.
 Stable moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
