                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, chronic trach presents with SOB, pulm
 edema. Now s/p ventilation and lasix  // please assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, particularly on the right however there is improved
 aeration of the right lung base with partial resolution of the airspace
 opacities.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 Right basilar atelectasis is unchanged.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
 seen.  The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given the rapid interval improvement in the right basal airspace opacity, this
 likely reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema although there is residual opacity
 in the right mid lung and superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
