                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Follow-up after clamping chest tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-erect AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is in place. There is also an unchanged chest tube and on the
 left as well as a right subclavian central venous catheter terminating in the
 upper superior vena cava. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. Bullet
 fragments again project over the chest. On this study there is a large new
 right-sided pneumothorax. The gap between the outer pleural edge and chest
 wall measures up to nearly 6 cm. Associated with this is new mild leftward
 shift suggesting tension. On the left, there is no definite persistent
 pneumothorax although a tiny one is possible. Increased density in the left
 lower lung suggests worsening atelectasis, however. There is no pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large right-sided pneumothorax with tension. Findings discussed, at the
 time of discovery, namely 13:05 pm, with Dr. ___ by telephone.
