                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilat chest tubes, s/p bronch  // ?interval
 change      ; ___ year old man with intubation  // ?tube placement      ; ___
 year old man with bilat chest tubes, resp distress  // ?collapse, ptx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple portable AP radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The radiograph from 20:32 hours shows no change in the position of
 pre-existing bilateral chest tubes, right subclavian central venous catheter,
 and metallic fragments from the known gunshot wounds. The left lung remains
 almost completely atelectatic with increased leftward deviation of the heart
 and mediastinum, indicating worsening atelectasis. A pneumothorax is still
 present. The right lung remains clear, and the tiny right apical pneumothorax
 is stable.
 
 The followup radiograph from 21:46 hours shows worsening near complete left
 lung atelectasis and an increased left pneumothorax. The patient has also been
 intubated, and the endotracheal tube tip is just distal to the clavicles.  The
 tiny right apical pneumothorax has resolved.
 
 The most recent radiograph from ___ hours shows marked re-expansion of the
 left lung with substantial decrease in the left pneumothorax, which has
 essentially resolved.
 There is now a combination of left midlung subsegmental atelectasis and
 re-expansion pulmonary edema. The right lung remains clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Consecutive radiographs initially show worsening of the known left
 pneumothorax and near complete atelectasis of the left lung with subsequent
 re-expansion of the left lung on the most recent radiograph.  The left
 pneumothorax has resolved, and there is now left mid lung subsegmental
 atelectasis and re-expansion pulmonary edema.  The patient has been intubated
 with the ET tube terminating at the level of the clavicles.  The tiny right
 apical pneumothorax has resolved.
