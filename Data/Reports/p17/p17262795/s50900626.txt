                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds, right base.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly
 better inspiration.  There are areas of bilateral opacification, some of which
 may reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  However, the possibility of
 multifocal consolidation in the right lung must be seriously considered.  The
 retrocardiac area is difficult to evaluate, and the possibility of supervening
 consolidation in the left lower lung cannot be excluded.  
 
 Extensive fixation devices in the spine are again seen.
