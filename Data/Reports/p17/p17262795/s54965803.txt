                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cerebral palsy, seizures.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  And ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This causes crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Heart size is borderline enlarged, and the mediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary edema is noted.  Focal
 opacity within the retrocardiac region may reflect an area of pneumonia or
 aspiration.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  ___ rod and
 spinal fusion hardware is noted within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam with low lung volumes causing crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  Retrocardiac opacity could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.
