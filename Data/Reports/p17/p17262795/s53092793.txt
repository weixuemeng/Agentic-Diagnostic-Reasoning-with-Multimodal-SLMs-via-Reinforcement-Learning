 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Central line pulled back, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the central venous access
 line has been pulled back.  The tip of the line now projects over the lower
 SVC, the line is very likely in correct position (this statement is limited by
 the fact that parts of the tip projects over the metallic stabilization
 devices).  The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation.  No new parenchymal opacities.  No pneumothorax.
