                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Removal of central line.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the previous study of this date, the right IJ
 catheter has been removed.  There is bilateral opacification that could
 reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure or possibly multifocal regions of
 consolidation.
