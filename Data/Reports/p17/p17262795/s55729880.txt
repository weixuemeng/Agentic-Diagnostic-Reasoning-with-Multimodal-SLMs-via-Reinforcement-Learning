 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question aspiration or edema.

 Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially over the preceding 48 hours. 
 There is, however, more consolidation at the base of the left lung, which
 could be pneumonia or atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
 effusion.  Stomach and colon remain substantially distended.  An upright chest
 radiograph is strongly recommended to exclude pneumoperitoneum.
 
 Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC.
