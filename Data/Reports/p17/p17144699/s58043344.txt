                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is moderate prominence of the pulmonary vascularity including
 indistinctness and upper zone redistribution suggesting mild-to-moderate
 vascular congestion.  Hazy basilar opacification suggests moderate bilaterla
 pleural effusions.  Associated atelectasis is suspected and lung volumes are
 low.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion
 with bilateral pleural effusions and opacities at the lung bases likely due to
 associated atelectasis.
