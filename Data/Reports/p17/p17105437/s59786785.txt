                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with wheezing and history of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated, causing crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 There are linear opacities at the bases, likely atelectasis. The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. There is no
 pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hypoinflated lungs with bilateral probable atelectasis. However, early
 pneumonia in the proper clinical setting cannot be fully excluded.
