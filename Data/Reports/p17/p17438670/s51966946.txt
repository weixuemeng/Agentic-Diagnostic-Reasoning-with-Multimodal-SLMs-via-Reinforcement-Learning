                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis.  Delayed for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is persistent opacity in the
 right lower lobe, best appreciated on the lateral view where the right
 hemidiaphragm is obscured.  Volume loss is evidenced by inferior displacement
 of the minor fissure.  Based on the prior CT, findings remain concerning for a
 malignancy with postobstructive collapse.  Either bronchoscopy or PET-CT is
 recommended. 
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged
 but unchanged.  Minimal dilation of the ascending aorta is stable.  The known
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not well appreciated on this modality. 
 Surgical clips are noted in the neck.
