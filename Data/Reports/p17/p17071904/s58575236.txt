                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable CXR
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute desat, now s/p bronch  // please look
 for interval improvement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable CXR
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable CXR ___ at 20:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CXR, patient underwent bronchoscopy with interval resolution
 of right lower lobe collapse.  There is still opacification of the right lung
 base, which is due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. 
 Additionally, the left costophrenic angle now appears blunted.  No
 pneumothorax.  The support devices including the right IJ introducer, ETT,
 enteric tube, left IJ catheter, and RUQ drain are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval resolution of right lower lobe collapse status post bronchoscopy.
 2.  New left lung base opacity, likely due to atelectasis and/or pleural
 effusion.
