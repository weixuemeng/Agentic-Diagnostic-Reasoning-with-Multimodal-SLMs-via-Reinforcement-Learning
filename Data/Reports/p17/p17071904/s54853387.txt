                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w HCV/alcohol cirrhosis   HCC s/p liver txp s/p multiple
 ex-laps and graft dysfunction now s/p re-do liver txp s/p takeback for
 proximal SMV-donor PV anatomosis for thrombus  // s/p bronch with mucous
 plugging - assess for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest two-view radiograph ___ at 22:51
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed several hours earlier, there has been
 interval development of a diffuse scattered opacities in both lungs.  These
 are much more prominent at the lung bases, particularly the right side.  No
 changes in the position of the support tubes/devices.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Rapid development of new diffuse opacities, concerning for pulmonary edema
 versus ARDS.
 2.  Bibasilar opacities likely due to pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis, but cannot exclude persistent right lower lobe collapse.
