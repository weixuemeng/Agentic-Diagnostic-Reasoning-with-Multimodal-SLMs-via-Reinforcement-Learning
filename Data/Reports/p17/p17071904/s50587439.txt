                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post extubation yesterday.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:13 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior study, the ET tube has been removed.  A right IJ central
 line has been removed.  A nasoenteric line remains present, extending beneath
 the diaphragm, beyond the edge of this film.  The left IJ line has also been
 removed.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is slightly more pronounced opacity
 at the left lung base.  Faint opacities in the left upper zone and more
 confluent opacity at the right base, _in the setting of an elevated right
 hemidiaphragm, are similar to the prior film.  Both right and left AC joints
 appear widened, but unchanged.  
 
 Curvilinear density overlying the right upper abdomen on the prior film is not
 seen on the current study. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of lines and tubes, without pneumothorax.  
 2.  Patchy opacity in the left mid zone is more pronounced.  
 3.  Given low lung volumes, some degree of vascular engorgement would be
 difficult to exclude.
