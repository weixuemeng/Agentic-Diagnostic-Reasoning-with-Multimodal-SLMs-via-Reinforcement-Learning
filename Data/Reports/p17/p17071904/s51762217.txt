 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extubation. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip not identified.  Lung volumes are diminished with streaky opacities at
 both bases suggestive of atelectasis or aspiration and crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature which may reflect a component of superimposed edema.
 More focal faint opacity in the right upper lobe also could reflect an area of
 atelectasis or be related to edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 positioning.  No large pneumothorax.
