 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Bibasilar interstitial
 abnormality is most likely residual edema and mild atelectasis, but aspiration
 can occur with little if any radiographic change.  Elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm is exacerbated by severe distention of the stomach with air and
 fluid.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 Heart size normal.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
