 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p acute desat  // Please look for any acute
 pulmonary processes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable CXR ___ 04:47am
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube, enteric tube, right IJ introducer, and right upper
 quadrant drain are unchanged in position. The transesophageal drain has been
 removed. Compared to the prior CXR, the interstitial edema has nearly
 resolved.  Worsening right lung base opacity is largely due to new right lower
 lobe collapse in addition to a pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New right lower lobe collapse, concerning for mucous plugging.
 2.  Interval resolution of interstitial edema.
