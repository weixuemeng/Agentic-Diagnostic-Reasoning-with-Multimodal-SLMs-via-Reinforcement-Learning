                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver transplant, respiratory failure, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 3:35 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  The ET tube
 tip lies approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.  A nasoenteric tube extends
 beneath the diaphragm off the film.  A right IJ central line tip overlies the
 distal SVC.  An additional catheter overlies the right upper quadrant of the
 abdomen, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with opacities at the right and left bases,
 which are similar to the prior film.  Possible slight increase in the degree
 of engorgement of the upper zone vessels, raising the question of early CHF.
