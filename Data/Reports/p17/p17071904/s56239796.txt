                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pullback OGT.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW CENTERED AT THE DIAPHRAGMS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 A nasoenteric tube is present.  The radiopaque tip overlies lowermost
 mediastinum, likely at the level of the distal esophagus.  It does not pass
 beyond the GE junction.  This represents considerable retraction compared with
 the prior study.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary findings are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval retraction of the OG tube, with radiopaque tip now
 overlying distal esophagus.  I do not think it extends beyond the GE junction.
