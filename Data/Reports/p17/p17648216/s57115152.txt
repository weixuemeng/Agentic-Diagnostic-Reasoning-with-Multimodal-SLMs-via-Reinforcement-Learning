                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  The upper two most sternal wires are again seen to be
 fracture.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting pleural
 effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Underlying consolidation cannot be
 excluded.  The right lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal to
 mildly enlarged. Surgical clips are noted within the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity may be due to atelectasis or possible pleural
 effusion.  Underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.  Dedicated PA
 and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if and when patient
 able.  Again seen fractured upper two most sternal wires.
