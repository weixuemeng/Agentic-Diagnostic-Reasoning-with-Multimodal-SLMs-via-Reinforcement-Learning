                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is increasing basilar retrocardiac opacification, suggesting a similar
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion with associated opacity, possibly
 atelectasis, but it is difficult to completely exclude an infectious process. 
 Right basilar opacity is unchanged and also suggests atelectasis.  There is
 also a small pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar basilar opacities and pleural effusions, allowing for
 increased lung volumes.
