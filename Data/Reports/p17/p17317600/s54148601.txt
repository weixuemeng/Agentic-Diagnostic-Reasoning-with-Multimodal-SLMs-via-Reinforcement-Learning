 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Prominent murmur and ascites.  Question pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unremarkable.  There is patchy opacification of the
 left costophrenic sulcus suggesting a small pleural effusion.  There may be a
 small pleural effusion on the right side, but not definite.  The lungs appear
 clear aside from patchy left basilar opacities suggesting minor atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions without
 frank congestive heart failure.  The heart at the upper limits of normal size.
