                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with back pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable prominent cardiac
 silhouette as compared to one year prior.  There are atherosclerotic
 calcifications in the aortic arch.  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and aortic valve as well as CABG.  There are mild interstitial changes in the
 upper lungs which appears similar to perhaps slightly increased.  The lungs
 appear otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or
 pleural effusion.  A large hiatal hernia is redemonstrated.  Displaced right
 humeral fracture is unchanged in configuration since at least ___.  Marked
 kyphosis is also unchanged.  Allowing for significant diffuse osteopenia, no
 new compression fracture is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial change in the upper lungs which appears perhaps
 slightly more prominent; this could be associated with chronic congestion or
 mild congestion superimposed on background lung disease or perhaps an
 underlying interstitial process.  Clinical correlation is recommended
 regarding the possibility of chronic interstitial disease favoring the upper
 lungs; chest CT could be applied to investigate further if clinically
 indicated.
