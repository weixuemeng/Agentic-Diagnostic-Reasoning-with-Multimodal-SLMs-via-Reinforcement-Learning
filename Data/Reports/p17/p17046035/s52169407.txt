                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of prior fracture and right hemothorax. Evaluate for
 increased hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from approximately 2.5 hr prior on the same day, as well
 as chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a cardiomediastinal
 silhouette which is top normal in size to mildly enlarged.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity likely corresponds to a large hiatal hernia
 with adjacent compressive atelectasis seen on the CT from the same day.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pleural effusion.
 2. Retrocardiac opacity, likely corresponding to a large hiatal hernia with
 adjacent compressive atelectasis, as seen on CT from the same day.
 3. Mild cardiomegaly.
