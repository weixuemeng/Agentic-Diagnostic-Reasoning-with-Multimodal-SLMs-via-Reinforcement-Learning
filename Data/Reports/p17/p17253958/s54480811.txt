                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p assault w/ b/l mandibular fractures and trace R SAH  //
 line placement after transport
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph from earlier the same date, a nasogastric
 tube is been placed, with tip directed cephalad in the fundus.  Exam is
 otherwise remarkable for substantial improvement in right lower lobe
 atelectasis and apparent resolution of a small right pleural effusion, as well
 as apparent development of a new small left pleural effusion.  Lung apices are
 excluded from the radiograph, limiting assessment for pneumothorax.
