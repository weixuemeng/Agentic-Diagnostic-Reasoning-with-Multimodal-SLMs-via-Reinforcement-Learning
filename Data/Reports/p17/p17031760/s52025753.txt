                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Attempted internal jugular line placement.  Evaluation for
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from 6 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bilateral lungs and
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance compared with the
 prior study with bilateral opacifications suspicious for pneumonia or
 aspiration.  There has also been interval repositioning of the endotracheal
 tube, which is now in appropriate position, terminating 4.3 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube has also been repositioned since the prior
 study, coursing below the diaphragm with side hole below the level of the
 diaphragm, but near the gastroesophageal junction, and could be advanced
 several cm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence pneumothorax.  Unchanged appearance of bilateral
 consolidations, concerning for aspiration and pneumonia. 
 
 2. Interval repositioning of endotracheal tube, now in appropriate position.
 
 3. Interval repositioning of nasogastric tube with side hole near the
 gastroesophageal junction, which could be advanced several centimeters.
