                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Found down.  Evaluation for pneumonia and endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to outside CT of the chest from 5 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube which
 terminates 2 cm above the carina, and can be withdrawn at least 1.5 cm.  There
 is consolidation within the left midlung, likely representing pneumonia and/or
 aspiration, as well as hazy opacification in the right perihilar region and
 right lung base, also suspicious for pneumonia and/or aspiration.  There is
 blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, likely due to small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  
 
 An esophageal tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm.  The
 heart size is mildly enlarged.  There is partially visualized surgical
 hardware within the cervical spine. Residual contrast is seen in the bilateral
 renal collecting systems from prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Dense consolidation in the left mid lung along with hazy opacification in the
 right perihilar region and lung bases, concerning for pneumonia and/or
 aspiration. The endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina, and could
 be withdrawn at least 1.5 cm.
