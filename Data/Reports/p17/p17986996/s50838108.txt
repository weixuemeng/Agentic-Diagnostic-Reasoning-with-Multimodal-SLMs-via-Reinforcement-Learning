                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with nausea, L-arm pain, heartburn, evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, possibly representing mild cardiomegaly.
 Otherwise, the mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The bilateral
 hila are unremarkable.  Subtle opacity near the right cardiophrenic angle
 likely represents crowding of normal bronchovascular structures and overlying
 soft tissue.  Otherwise, there is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal lung consolidation.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
