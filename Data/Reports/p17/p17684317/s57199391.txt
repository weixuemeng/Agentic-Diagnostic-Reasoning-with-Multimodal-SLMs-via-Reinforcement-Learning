  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged in size but
  layering more densely in the lower chest due to more upright position. There
  is a persistent retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis but
  pneumonia is not entirely excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dysphagia s/p rib fractures, now with wet
 cough and crackles at left base/mid lung  // infiltrate     infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 at both bases, more prominent on the right, consistent with bilateral pleural
 effusions and compressive atelectasis. Continued enlargement of cardiac
 silhouette with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. In view of the basilar
 changes, it would be very difficult to exclude pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
