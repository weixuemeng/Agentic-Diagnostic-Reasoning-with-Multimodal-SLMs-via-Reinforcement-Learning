                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain with presyncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is a patchy density obscuring the left hemidiaphragm to a slight degree,
 although not specific.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar density obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. 
 Pneumonia could be considered versus atelectasis.  Short-term followup PA and
 lateral radiographs may be useful if needed clinically.
