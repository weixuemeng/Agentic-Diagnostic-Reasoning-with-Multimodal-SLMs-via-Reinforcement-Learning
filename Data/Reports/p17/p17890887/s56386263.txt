                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right IJ placement.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from earlier the same
 day, ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi erect frontal image of the chest.  There has been
 interval placement of right IJ line, which terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.  The lungs are well expanded.  There are heterogeneous peribronchial
 markings in the lungs bilaterally, which could represent an atypical pneumonia
 or less likely pulmonary edema from heart failure.   The lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ terminating in the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 
 2.  Heterogeneous peribronchial markings in the lungs bilaterally, which could
 represent an atypical pneumonia or less likely pulmonary edema from heart
 failure.  Recommend clinical observation for development of characteristic
 symptoms.
