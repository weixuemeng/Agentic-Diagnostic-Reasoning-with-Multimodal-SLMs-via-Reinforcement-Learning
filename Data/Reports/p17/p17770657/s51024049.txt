                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 at 00:05.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval insertion of a
 Dobbhoff tube which is coiled within in the stomach and then turns back  to
 terminate in the esophagus at the level of the clavicles.  There is a
 left-sided PICC line with tip terminating in the mid SVC.  There are
 multifocal opacifications, worst in the lung bases, which may represent
 atelectasis, though infectious process is consideration, possibly aspiration. 
 Dense opacification projecting over the right mid lung corresponds to a
 loculated fissural effusion evident on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff tube with tip coiled in stomach and tip terminating in
 the upper esophagus.  Multiple opacifications likely represent multifocal
 pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration.  Loculated pleural effusion in the
 right fissure.
