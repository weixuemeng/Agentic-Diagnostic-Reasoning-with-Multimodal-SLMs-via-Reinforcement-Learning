                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post sternal plating.  Evaluate for
 effusion or consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A feeding tube is noted with the tip not
 clearly visualized in the field of view provided.  A right PICC tip projects
 over the level of the low SVC.  Hyperexpanded lungs with decreased vascularity
 appear consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Opacification
 within the right middle lobe appears consistent with loculated fissural
 effusion evident on the prior CT, slightly more prominent on today's study
 compared to the prior examination.  Minimal opacification at bilateral lung
 bases is stable to slightly improved compared to the prior radiograph of ___ obtained at 14:27.
