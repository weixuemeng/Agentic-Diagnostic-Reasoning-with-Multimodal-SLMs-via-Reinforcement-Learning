                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post MVR, evaluate pigtail catheter.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Pigtail catheter in the anterior chest wall appears to be slightly lower than
 before.  There has been almost complete resolution of anterior air-fluid
 collection in the anterior chest wall.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Patient has emphysema.  There is no evident pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Small bibasilar and right upper lobe consolidations are
 grossly unchanged.
