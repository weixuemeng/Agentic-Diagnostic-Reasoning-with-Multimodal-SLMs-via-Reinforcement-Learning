                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate pigtail placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  There is a new right pigtail
 catheter in the right hemithorax.  Large known anterior air- fluid collection
 is not longer visualized, though would be better evaluated with a lateral
 radiograph to assess any residual air or fluid.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Small right perihilar and bilateral opacities largely on the right side are
 grossly unchanged consistent with infectious process.  Patient has known
 emphysema.  There are no other acute interval changes.
