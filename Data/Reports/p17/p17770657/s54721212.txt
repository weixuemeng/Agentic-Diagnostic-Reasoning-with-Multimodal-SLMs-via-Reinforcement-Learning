 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after pectoralis flaps and sternal plating.

 New heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lung at least some of which

 base, is all new since ___, considered pneumonia until proved
 otherwise.  New anterior chest wall drains are noted.  Heart is normal size. 
 The hyperinflation and vascular deficiency of emphysema are longstanding.  A
 ring shadow in the left upper lung at the level of the aortic arch is more
 prominent today than it has been since an abnormality in this region was
 demonstrated on chest CT scanning in ___.  There may be a second similar
 region in the right lower lung at the level of the sixth anterior rib.  These
