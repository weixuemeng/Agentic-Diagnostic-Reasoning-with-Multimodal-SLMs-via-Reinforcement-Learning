                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest pain, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and targeted review of chest CT from
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  Multiple surgical clips are seen about the mediastinum, consistent with
 prior surgery.  A linear wire-like density is again noted in the retrosternal
 region, unchanged.  Previously seen  anterior chest wall drains have been
 removed.  
 
 On today's exam, the heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is
 prominence of a hila suggesting element of pulmonary hypertension, probably
 unchanged.  There is some linear atelectasis and/or scarring at both lung
 bases.  Ring-like opacity in the left upper zone seen on the prior study has
 resolved, with only minimal residual scarring.  No CHF or new focal infiltrate
 is detected.  No effusions are identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 Relative lucency at the right base is thought to represent an artifact due to
 overlying soft tissues of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Background COPD, with suspected pulmonary hypertension.
 2. Status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.  No CHF.  
 3. No acute infiltrate identified.  Residual scarring noted, detailed above.  
 4. No pneumothorax detected.
