                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sternal reconstruction.  Evaluate for
 effusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, mediastinal chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ selected
 images from a CT study dated ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the sternal wires with placement of new sternal
 closure devices, mediastinal ___ and tubes.  Lungs are well inflated with
 linear streaky opacities seen at the left base likely representing scarring
 and/or subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema,
 pneumothorax, pleural effusions or focal airspace consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.  Slight lucency at the left apex is felt to be related to
 underlying emphysema rather than representing a pneumothorax.
