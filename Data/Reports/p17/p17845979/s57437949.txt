                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation in mind, heart size and
 pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits.  Bronchial wall thickening is
 present in both lower lobes, best visualized on the lateral view in the
 infrahilar region.  No confluent areas of consolidation are observed, and
 there are no pleural effusions.  Gunshot fragments project over the lateral
 left hemithorax without change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
 2.  Lower lobe bronchial wall thickening, possibly due to chronic airways
 disease considering the presence of thick-walled bronchi in these regions on
 previous PET-CT of ___.
