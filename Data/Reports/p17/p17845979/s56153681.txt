                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, altered mental status and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portion of the left lateral chest is excluded.  Small round
 metallic foreign bodies again project over the left lateral chest.  The lung
 volumes are low.  Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no evidence for
 pleural effusion.  The lungs appear clear within the limitations of technique.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
