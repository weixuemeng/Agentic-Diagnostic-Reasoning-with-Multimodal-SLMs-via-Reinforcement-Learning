                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia now with fever. Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been progressive worsening of bilateral interstitial opacities from
 ___. Given the absence of supporting radiographic evidence for
 pulmonary edema, this is thought to be compatible with atypical pneumonia.  No
 pleural effusion and the heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Without supportive radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema, the worsening
 bilateral interstitial opacities are compatible with atypical pneumonia.
