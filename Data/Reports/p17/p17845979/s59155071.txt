 INDICATION:  Concern for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small metallic pellets again overlie the left hemithorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 Bibasilar linear opacities, slightly more prominent on the right, may reflect
 atelectasis, though early consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
