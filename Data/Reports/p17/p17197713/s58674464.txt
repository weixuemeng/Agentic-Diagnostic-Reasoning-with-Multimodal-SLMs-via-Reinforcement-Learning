                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies at the level of the midclavicular heads,
 approximately 7.8 cm above the carina.  Two NG/OG-type tubes are present. One
 can clearly be seen extending beneath the diaphragm.  The other one is
 difficult to trace beyond the lower esophagus, though this may be due to
 underpenetration.  Right and left IJ central lines both overlie the proximal
 SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is dense alveolar opacity, most pronounced in the left middle and lower
 zones, consistent with pulmonary consolidation.  This is similar, but slightly
 more confluent, than on ___ at 4:53 a.m. and extends slightly higher on
 this examination.
 
 Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  There is atelectasis in the right lung and minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no frank right-sided
 consolidation.  Probable upper zone redistribution.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left mid and lower zone consolidation again seen, slightly more
 pronounced compared with one day earlier.  Upper zone redistribution,
 essentially unchanged.
