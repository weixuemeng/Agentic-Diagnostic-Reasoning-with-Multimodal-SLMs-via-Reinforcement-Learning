                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure, interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 5.6 cm above carina.  Feeding tube and NG tube are probably in
 the stomach : the distal end is not included in this study.  Bilateral jugular
 lines are in upper SVC.
 
 Left lung widespread opacity compatible with pneumonia is unchanged.  Right
 lung ground-glass opacity with pulmonary vessel enlargement is probably
 compatible with moderate pulmonary edema that has increased since prior exam. 
 Mediastinal and cardiac contours are top normal and unchanged.  Pleural
 effusion is small if any on the left side.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left severe pneumonia is unchanged.
 2.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 3.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.
