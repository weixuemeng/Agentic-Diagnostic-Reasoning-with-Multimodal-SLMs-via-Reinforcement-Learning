                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has been intubated with endotracheal tube tip
 terminating about 9.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube coils in the
 stomach with associated decrease in gastric distention since prior study. 
 Persistent airspace consolidation in the left perihilar and basilar regions is
 consistent with known pneumonia, accompanied by moderate left pleural
 effusion.  Previously demonstrated horizontal interface appears slightly less
 distinct, but this may reflect the lack of upright positioning.  As reported
 previously, this finding raises the concern for loculated hydropneumothorax. 
 Right lung and pleural surfaces remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Proximal location of endotracheal tube, as discussed with Dr.
 ___ by telephone at 9 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. 
 Evolving left lung pneumonia and questionable hydropneumothorax also discussed
 at the same time.
