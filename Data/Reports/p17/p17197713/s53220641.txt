                                 FINAL REPORT
 9:03 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with past history of non-insulin-dependent
 diabetes.  Left lower lobe consolidation and anion gap acidosis.  Increasing
 oxygen requirements.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Severe pulmonary consolidation has progressed in the right lung, both upper
 and lower lobes since it appeared on ___.  Preceding severe consolidation
 in the left lung may have worsened minimally, and now appears to have a small
 cavity, at the level of the cardiac apex.  At least a small left pleural
 effusion is present and hazy opacification in the upper lungs indicates at
 least a component of pulmonary edema.  To what extent the progressing
 consolidation on the right is hydrostatic edema, diffuse alveolar damage or
 multifocal pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate, but I am aware that
 the patient is receiving large volumes of fluid resuscitation.
 
 ET tube, left internal jugular line, and two enteric tubes are in standard
 positions.  There is no pneumothorax.
