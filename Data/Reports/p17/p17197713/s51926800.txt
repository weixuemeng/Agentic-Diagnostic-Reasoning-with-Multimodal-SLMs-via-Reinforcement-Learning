                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is some increase in the opacification densely
 involving the mid and lower lung and mildly involving the more upper portions.
 This is again consistent with widespread pneumonia, known to represent
 Legionella.
