                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now terminating in standard
 position about 4.5 cm above the carina.  Extensive pneumonic consolidation is
 again visualized in the left perihilar and basilar regions with adjacent
 moderate left pleural effusion, but no definite pneumothorax or
 hydropneumothorax is visualized on this semi-upright study.  New patchy
 opacity at right lung base could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration or
 additional site of pneumonia.
