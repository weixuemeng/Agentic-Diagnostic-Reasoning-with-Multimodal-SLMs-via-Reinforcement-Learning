                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.  Evaluate for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest ___.  Chest radiograph ___. 
 Multiple chest radiographs dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior x-ray and CT, the predominantly left
 upper and mid lung zone opacities have resolved.  There is no definite
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged.  A right PICC
 terminates in the low SVC.  Cervical hardware is present in the neck and
 incompletely evaluated.  Prominent air-filled loops of bowel are noted below
 the hemidiaphragms, and not significantly changed from the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  PICC terminates in the low SVC.
 3.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 3.  Prominent loops of air-filled bowel are partially imaged, and stable.  If
 further evaluation is necessary, could obtain a dedicated abdominal
 radiograph.
