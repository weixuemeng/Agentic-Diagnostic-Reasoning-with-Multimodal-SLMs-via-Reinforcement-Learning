                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear stable allowing for differences in technique.  There is fairly
 substantial retrocardiac opacification, although predominantly linear and
 streaky.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base, somewhat striking
 although suggestive atelectasis; an infectious process is difficult to
 exclude, however.
