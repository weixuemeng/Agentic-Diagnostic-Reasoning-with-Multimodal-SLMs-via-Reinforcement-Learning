                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and increasing oxygen requirement
 following distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 In comparison to prior study, the lung volumes are markedly low with resultant
 bronchovascular crowding.  Basilar opacities, particularly retrocardiac,
 likely represent atelectasis.  There is no focal opacity concerning for
 pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours
 are unchanged, accounting for technique.  Accounting for low lung volumes,
 there is no evidence of vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  Postoperative changes are seen in the upper abdomen, with a
 drain in the left upper quadrant and an epidural catheter projecting over the
 left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decrease in lung volumes accounts for all findings seen on chest
 radiograph.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
