                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is perihilar fullness with
 streaky perihilar opacities suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  In that setting, patchy right apical opacity may likewise
 represent a form of pulmonary vascular congestion; however, it is a somewhat
 unusual pattern.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy
 new right upper lung opacities which may be due to an asymmetric form of
 edema, perhaps superimposed on small bulla, but not well characterized. 
 Short-term followup repeat radiographs are recommended following treatment in
 order to reassess.
