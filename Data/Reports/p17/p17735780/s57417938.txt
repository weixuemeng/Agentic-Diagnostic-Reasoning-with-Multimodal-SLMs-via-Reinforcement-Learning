                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent bowel obstruction, new onset cough, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:26 a.m. chest x-ray.
 
 Compared to the prior film, the NG tube has been removed.  Inspiratory volumes
 are slightly better.  Again seen is vascular plethora as well as right
 suprahilar patchy opacity and some patchy opacity of both lung bases.  The
 right mid/upper zone opacity is more pronounced than on the prior film.  No
 effusion is detected on either side.  Marked bowel dilatation is again noted,
 similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable CHF.  Opacity in the right mid/upper zone is asymmetric
 and could reflect an early pneumonic infiltrate.
