                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:41 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral pneumonia, question interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Yesterday's dramatic improvement in bilateral airspace
 opacification is much more consistent with resolving edema than improving
 pneumonia.  A moderate component of interstitial abnormality persists,
 although mediastinal veins are less distended.  Heart size is normal.  Small
 left pleural effusion stable.
 
 Intestinal distension is still visible in the upper abdomen.  ET tube and
 right PIC line in standard placements, respectively.
