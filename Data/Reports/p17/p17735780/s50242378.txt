                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, status post intubation and bronch.  ET tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip is in satisfactory position approximately 4.5
 cm above the carina.  A right PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Compared with ___, there has been
 progression of opacities in both the right and left lungs, with more confluent
 opacity in the right upper and mid zones and right cardiophrenic region and at
 the left base.  These appear to have both interstitial and alveolar
 components.  Again seen is dilatation of bowel.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings in keeping with extensive multifocal bilateral pneumonia
 as demonstrated on the chest CT obtained earlier the same day.  ET tube in
 satisfactory position above the carina.
