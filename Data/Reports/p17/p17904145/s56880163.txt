                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope and bystander started CPR.  Question broken ribs or
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema,
 pneumonia or pleural effusion.  The ribs appear unremarkable on these
 non-dedicated rib views.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.  Dedicated rib views
 should be obtained if there is further clinical concern.
