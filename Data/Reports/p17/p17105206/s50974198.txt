                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with a history of MDS and CHF, now with shortness
 of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Decreased fluid within the right major fissure.  Inferior displacement of the
 right major fissure with slight obscuration of the middle portion of the right
 hemidiaphragm suggest right lower lobe atelectasis.  No good evidence of
 pneumonia, but chest CT is more sensitive for the detection of early
 pneumonia.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely right lower lobe atelectasis without good evidence for pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider CT chest for further evaluation if clinical
 concern for pneumonia persists.
