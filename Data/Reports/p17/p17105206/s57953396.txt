                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Afib  // CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with fissural fluid seen on the
 lateral view, which likely represents a subpulmonic pleural effusion, that is
 not significantly changed in comparison to the prior chest radiograph.  There
 are multiple bilateral ill-defined patchy opacities, mostly in the upper lung
 fields.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral ill-defined patchy opacities, which may represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, but is also concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 2. Unchanged right subpulmonic pleural effusion.
