                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new onset atrial fibrillation, lower extremity
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly tortuous. The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with enlargement of the left
 pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 Emphysematous changes are most pronounced in the upper lobes. Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present with
 patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax is present. Moderate to severe multilevel degenerative changes
 are again noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis. No pulmonary
 edema. Moderate emphysema.
