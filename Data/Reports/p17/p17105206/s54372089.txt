                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with iron overload, here w/ heart failure,
 admission xray w/ patchy infiltrates edema vs multifocal pna  // f/u
 infiltrates, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___, again seen are patchy opacities in both lungs. 
 Allowing for technical differences, the appearance is similar, likely
 accentuated by increased contrast on the current film.  As before, the right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, with a small effusion.  Minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle is also similar to the prior film.
 
 Again seen is mild cardiomegaly with background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 Incidental made of probable old healed rib fractures at the left lung apex.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral patchy opacities, non-specific, but consistent with multifocal
 pneumonic infiltrates.  Background COPD.  Stable mild cardiomegaly. Doubt
 significant CHF.  Small bilateral effusions are similar to the ___ 
 study.
