                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cholangitis, AFib, evaluation for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has increased and bilateral
 pleural effusions have newly appeared.  In addition, there is mild perihilar
 haze and increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature.  Overall, these
 findings are consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 Newly appeared mild bilateral areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
