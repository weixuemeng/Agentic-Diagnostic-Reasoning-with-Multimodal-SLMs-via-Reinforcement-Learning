                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes that may
 accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette.  No definite vascular
 congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  The region behind the
 heart is difficult to assess and a lateral view would be helpful if the
 condition of the patient permits.
