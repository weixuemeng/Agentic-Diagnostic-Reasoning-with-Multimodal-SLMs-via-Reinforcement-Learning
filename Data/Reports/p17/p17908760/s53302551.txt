                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post right VATS procedure complicated by
 hemothorax, now with chest tube removed.  Here to evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  The prior chest radiograph performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a right apical chest tube with
 development of a moderate right pneumothorax.  There is stable elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm and no appreciable mediastinal shift.  A patchy
 opacity in the right lower lobe, best appreciated on the lateral view, likely
 represents an area of atelectasis.  No large pleural effusions or focal
 consolidations are seen.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  A small amount of subcutaneous air is seen tracking
 along the right chest wall at the site of prior chest tube.  Interval removal
 of nasogastric tube is also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right-sided pneumothorax after chest tube removal with
 associated right lower lobe atelectasis.
