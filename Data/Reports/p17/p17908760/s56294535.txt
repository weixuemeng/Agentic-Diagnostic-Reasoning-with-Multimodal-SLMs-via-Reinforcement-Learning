                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:47 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic pleomorphic liposarcoma after IVC
 ligation and right nephrectomy.  DVT and pulmonary emboli a year ago.  Acute
 onset of shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Right hemithorax is uniformly opacified and mediastinum shifted substantially
 to the left by a large acute or subacute right pleural effusion.  Lung
 metastases in the aerated left lung have grown.  Heart size is indeterminate,
 because the right heart border is obscured by pleural fluid and atelectasis. 
 Tiny left pleural effusion is probably not clinically significant.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 1:10 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized,
 and we discussed the findings by telephone a minute later.
