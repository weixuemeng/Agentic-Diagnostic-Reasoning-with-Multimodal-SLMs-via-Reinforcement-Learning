                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pressure and dyspnea with decreased breath sounds at the right
 base.  Evaluate for effusion, infiltrate, and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT of the torso dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate multiple
 nodular densities in the left lung field as well as a 3 x 2 cm dominant nodule
 at the right supradiaphragmatic region.  In this patient with high-grade
 liposarcoma, these likely represent metastases.  No pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or acute infiltrate are seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Surgical clips from a prior IVC sarcoma resection are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pleural effusion, acute infiltrate, or pneumothorax.
 2.  Multiple nodular densities in the left lung field and dominant right
 basilar nodule which in this patient with a history of high-grade liposarcoma,
 likely represent metastases.
