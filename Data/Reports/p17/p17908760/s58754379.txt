                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST X-RAY
 
 HISTORY:  Follow up effusion.
 
 An upright portable chest radiograph shows that there is now some air density
 at the right apex with an appearance more suggestive of lung than
 pneumothorax.  The remainder of the right hemithorax remains obscured and
 positioning of the pigtail catheter appears unchanged.  There is slightly less
 leftward mediastinal shift suggesting decreasing pleural fluid on the right. 
 Again noted are multiple pulmonary nodules in the aerated left lung.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Some decrease in massive right pleural effusion evidenced by
 decreased mediastinal shift and visible aerated lung at the right apex.
