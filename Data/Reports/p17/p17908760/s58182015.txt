                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ at 22:49
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular vascular catheter continues to terminate in
 the proximal right atrium.  Small right apical pneumothorax is present and is
 likely unchanged allowing for positional differences between the studies. 
 Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent opacities in the right mid and
 lower lung regions also appear unchanged.  Remainder of the exam is similar to
 prior study performed less than one hour previous.
