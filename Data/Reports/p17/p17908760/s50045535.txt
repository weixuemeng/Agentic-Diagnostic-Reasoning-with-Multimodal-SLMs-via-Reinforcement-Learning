                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic IVC liposarcoma status post right hemothorax evacuation. 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___ at
 08:03.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  2 right pleural tubes terminate in the
 right lung apex. There is persistent near complete opacification of the right
 hemithorax with slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures, suggesting
 right lung atelectasis with likely coexisting effusion.  These changes are
 superimposed on re-expansion edema and residual consolidation.  Small left
 pleural effusion persists.  Widespread nodular pulmonary metastases are
 similar to prior.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable appearance of near complete right hemithorax opacification consistent
 with right lung atelectasis with coexisting pleural effusion.
