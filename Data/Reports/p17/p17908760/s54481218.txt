 reassessment for interval change in pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval improvement in
 the pneumothorax.  The right side is completely resolved.  There is a small
 amount of left-sided pneumothorax remaining.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Low lung volumes are seen and
 likely are responsible for vascular crowding that is visualized.
