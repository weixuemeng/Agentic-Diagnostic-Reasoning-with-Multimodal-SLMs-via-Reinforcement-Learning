                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:45
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with leiomyosarcoma, status post right VATS
 decortication with repositioning of the chest tube, assess for lung expansion.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 17:12.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 11:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 There has been repositioning of the right chest tube, which now has its tip at
 the apex.  There is a very subtle small right apical pneumothorax.  The
 elliptical opacity in the right mid lung is no longer present and therefore
 likely represented fluid/blood which was loculated within the horizontal
 fissure.  Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is seen within the right
 lateral chest wall.  The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  Lung volumes
 remain low with streaky opacities at both bases, likely reflecting
 subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Interval placement
 of a nasogastric tube which is coiled within the stomach.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No large left effusion.
