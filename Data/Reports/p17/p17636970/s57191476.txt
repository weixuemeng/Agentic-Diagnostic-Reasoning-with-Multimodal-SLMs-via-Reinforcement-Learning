 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the volumes of the lungs
 have decreased bilaterally.  As a consequence, there is increased crowding of
 the vascular structures at the lung bases.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and
 mediastinal structures.
