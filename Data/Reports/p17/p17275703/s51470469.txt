                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx breast cancer, recurrent pneumonias and
 resolving pulmonary infiltrates on prior chest CT.  s/p URI with cough now
 with wheezing right lung base and pain lower ribs right side.  // R/O
 infectious process, rib abnormalities
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a rounded consolidation in the right
 upper lobe, adjacent to an area of pleural thickening, has substantially
 increased in density and size. Although a fibrotic process was visualized on
 the CT examination performed in ___, this process now seems to have
 increased. A repeat CT examination should be performed to exclude the presence
 of a neoplastic lesion.  Minimal parenchymal heterogeneities at the level of
 the right upper lobe which reflect areas of scarring documented on the
 previous CT examination.
 The lateral radiograph shows a solitary nodule in retrosternal location which
 was not present on the previous CT examination.  The presence of a metastatic
 lesion needs to be excluded.  No evidence of acute lung disease.  A minimal
 atelectasis at the level of the right lower lobe is unchanged.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the findings and the recommendation
 for CT where entered into the radiology dashboard system.
