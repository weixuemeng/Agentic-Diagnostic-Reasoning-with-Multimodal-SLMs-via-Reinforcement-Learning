                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer status post chemotherapy with chills and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Patchy opacities are noted in the right
 lung, predominant within the right upper and middle lobes, with bronchiectasis
 and bronchial wall thickening. Findings appear improved compared to the
 previous radiograph from ___, but appears slightly worse when
 compared to the previous CT from ___.  Streaky opacity in the left
 lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and patchy opacities within the
 right lung, most pronounced within the right upper and middle lobes. Findings
 appear slightly progressed compared to the prior CT exam, and are concerning
 for airways inflammation and infection.
