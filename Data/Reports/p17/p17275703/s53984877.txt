                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:03 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with complete heart block, now recovered sinus
 rhythm after a short period of CPR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heart is minimally larger today than in ___ but still well
 within normal limits and there is no pulmonary edema.
 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Surgical drains overlie the
 right chest wall, presumably following mastectomy, reflecting subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Right apical lung scarring has not progressed since ___, and
 there is no other focal pulmonary abnormality.
 
 There are no displaced rib fractures, but conventional chest radiographs are
 relatively insensitive in detecting subtle chest cage trauma.  Any regions of
 focal tenderness should be marked for detailed rib views.
