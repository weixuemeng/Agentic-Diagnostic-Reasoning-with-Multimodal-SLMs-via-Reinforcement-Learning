                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Question TB.  Immunosuppression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, reflecting improved ventilation.  There is a massive decrease in
 extent and severity of a pre-existing right lung opacity.  At the site of the
 former opacity, a linear scar is seen on today's image.  No evidence of acute
 changes.  In particular, there is no evidence of tuberculous infection.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  No pleural effusions.
