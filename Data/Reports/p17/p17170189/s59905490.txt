                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  There are low lung volumes which accentuate the size of
 the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged, with a left
 ventricular predominance.  There is apparent widening of the superior
 mediastinum which also may be due to low lung volumes.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures, without overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal consolidation is noted. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, without definite acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality.
