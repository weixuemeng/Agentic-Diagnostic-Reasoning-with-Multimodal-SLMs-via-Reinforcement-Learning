                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with 10 days cough, crackles left lung  //
 evaluate for pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ radiograph, multifocal reticular and nodular
 opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left are again
 demonstrated. These findings correspond to a pattern of pulmonary fibrosis on
 ___ chest CT attributed to NSIP at that time.  No definite superimposed
 acute findings are evident to suggest infectious pneumonia, but early A and
 focal pneumonia is may be difficult to detect in the setting of diffuse lung
 disease. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and there are no
 pleural effusions.
