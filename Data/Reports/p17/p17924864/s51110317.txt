                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion and cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal contour appears unchanged. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable, and no pulmonary edema is present.  Increased
 interstitial opacities are seen within the right lung diffusely, as well as in
 the left lung base, findings which appear worse in the right lung compared to
 the previous chest radiograph.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening interstitial opacities within the right lung, which may reflect a
 superimposed infectious process on a background of chronic interstitial
 abnormality previously characterized on CT as NSIP.
