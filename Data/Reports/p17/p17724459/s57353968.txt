                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and without change.  Within
 the lungs, a small opacity has developed in the periphery of the left lower
 lobe, partially obscuring a small portion of the left hemidiaphragm.  An
 adjacent linear opacity is seen peripherally just above this level.  No
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or acute, displaced rib fracture is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific peripheral left lower lobe opacity, which could be
 due to localized atelectasis or an early focus of pneumonia.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, a pulmonary infarct is an additional
 consideration.  Findings communicated by phone to Dr. ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 10:30 a.m. at the time of discovery.
