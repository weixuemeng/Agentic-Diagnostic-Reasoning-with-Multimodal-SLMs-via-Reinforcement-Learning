                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with tachycardia, SOB  // eval for fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Examination is limited secondary to patient body habitus, portable technique
 and apparent motion.  There is no definite confluent consolidation although
 subtle opacities could certainly be missed.  Enlargement of the right hilum
 which could represent pulmonary artery enlargement or adenopathy is noted. 
 Cardiac silhouette is slightly prominent but this is likely accentuated by
 portable technique and positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam for which repeat is suggested for more detailed evaluation. 
 Enlarged right hilum could be due to pulmonary artery enlargement or
 underlying adenopathy and attention suggested on followup.
