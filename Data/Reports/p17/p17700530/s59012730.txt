                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Elevated white blood cell count.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Interval improvement in left lower
 lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion is demonstrated with only minimal
 opacity currently seen.  The pleural effusion on both left and right is small.
 There is no pneumothorax.  There is nodular opacity projecting over the right
 lower lung, not clearly seen on the prior chest radiograph, the etiology is
 unclear and not definitely seen on the prior CT torso, reassessment in several
 days is recommended to document stability/resolution.
 
 The patient is after cholecystectomy.
