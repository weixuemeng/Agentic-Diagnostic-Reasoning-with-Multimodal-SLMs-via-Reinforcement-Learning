                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low, but there are no focal opacities. A nodular
 opacity just below the margin of the right hemidiaphragm represents a
 calcified granuloma seen in prior CT.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the lower SVC, unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
