                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoglycemia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal
 patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar patchy opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes. Infection is not completely excluded, and if there is continued
 clinical concern, consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved
 inspiratory effort.
