                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 ___M with chest pain after MVA evaluate for rib fracture. .
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___ and ___
 TECHNIQUE
 Frontal and lateral view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lateral view shows a nondisplaced fracture of the mid portion of the sternal
 body, with a modest amount of presternal and retrosternal bleeding.  No
 displaced rib fracture is seen, but since the conventional chest radiograph is
 not sensitive in detecting subtle chest cage trauma, the subsequent chest CT
 scan should be consulted. Sternal fracture is associated with hemopericardium
 and cardiac trauma and should be evaluated clinically and with appropriate
 imaging.
 
 Severe bullous emphysema is chronic. Bands of atelectasis or scarring 
 involving several bulla also are stable dating back to ___. Lower lung
 volumes are probably a reflection of splinting and would explain the relative
 increase in ___ in both lower lung zones compared to ___. This
 includes partial obliteration of the left cardiac border, but there is the
 possibility of some a lung contusion particularly in the lingula, and a
 smaller region in the axillary sub segments of the right upper lobe projecting
 over the third anterior interspace, also best evaluated on the chest CT. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of rib fracture.
 2. Nondisplaced sternal fracture.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the telephone by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 04:45, ___ min after they were made.
