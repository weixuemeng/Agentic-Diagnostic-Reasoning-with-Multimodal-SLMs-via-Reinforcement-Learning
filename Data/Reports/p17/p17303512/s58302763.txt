 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new IPH  // rule out infection      rule
 out infection
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  There is mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette with
 mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  The left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle are
 not well seen. This could reflect some small effusion and atelectatic changes,
 or merely be a manifestation of anterior soft tissues. No evidence of acute
 focal pneumonia.
