                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  There is some tortuosity of the aorta.  However, no
 evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.
 
 There is some prominence of interstitial markings at the bases, which could be
 a manifestation of the patient's known chronic lung disease.
