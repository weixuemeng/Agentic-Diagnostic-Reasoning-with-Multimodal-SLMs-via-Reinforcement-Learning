                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with decrease in oxygen
 saturation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___. 
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Right IJ sheath terminates at the origin of
 the right brachiocephalic vein.  Mild interstitial edema and vascular
 engorgement have improved and are superimposed on diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Small right pleural effusion is stable.  Bibasilar opacities have increased,
 representing either atelectasis or infection.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Improved pulmonary edema on background of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung
 disease.  Right base atelectasis and effusion are stable.
