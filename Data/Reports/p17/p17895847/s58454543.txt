                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT:
 
 Low lung volumes persist.  Scattered areas of atelectasis are present.  There
 is a general increase in interstitial patten consistent with known
 interstitial lung disease.  Some of it, however, is probably due to persistent
 failure.
