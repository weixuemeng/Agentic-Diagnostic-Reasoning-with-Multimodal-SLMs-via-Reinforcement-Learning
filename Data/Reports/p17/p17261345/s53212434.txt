                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with suspected COPD exacerbation.  // Please eval
 for e/o pneumonia or pulm edema.      Please eval for e/o pneumonia or pulm
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest radiograph ___ at 04:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval appearance of pulmonary vascular indistinctness and perihilar
 fullness suggestive of mild perihilar and pulmonary edema.  The cavitary
 nodular opacity in the right upper lobe is stable.  Patchy opacity at the
 right base is felt to more likely be related to the pulmonary edema rather
 than representing a superimposed infection.  This can be better assessed on
 followup imaging.  No large effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation.
