                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // R/O CHF
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views the chest provided.  There is a peripheral right mid lung
 opacity corresponding with abnormality on prior CT chest.  This lesion may
 represent scarring though an outpatient chest CT may be performed to further
 evaluate.  Emphysema is noted with no focal consolidation, large effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Peripheral opacity persists in the right mid lung at the site of prior
 cavitary lesion, likely representing scarring.  No convincing evidence for
 pneumonia or edema.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent CT chest
