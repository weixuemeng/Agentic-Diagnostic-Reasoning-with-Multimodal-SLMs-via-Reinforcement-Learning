                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:32 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with past medical history of coronary artery
 disease, diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, CHF exacerbation.  Previously
 demonstrated large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging here:
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, bilateral pleural effusions probably moderate in
 size, accompanying mild interstitial pulmonary edema attest to cardiac
 decompensation.  Additionally, there is dense consolidation in the left lower
 lobe which could be pneumonia or collapse and should be reevaluated after
 hemodynamic status improves.  Heart size is top normal.  No pneumothorax.
