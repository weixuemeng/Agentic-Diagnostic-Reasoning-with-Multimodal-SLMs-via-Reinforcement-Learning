                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of new-onset
 second-degree heart block, known interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  In the
 periphery of the right upper lobe as well as the right lung base, there are
 increased interstitial markings, which may relate to patient's interstitial
 lung disease, although there is no prior for comparison to assess for interval
 change and to exclude underlying infection.  The hila are slightly prominent,
 which may be due to underlying pulmonary engorgement.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The patient is
 rotated to the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings which may be due to patient's known interstitial lung
 disease as above, although given lack of priors for comparison, unable to
 assess for interval change and to exclude infection.  Probable pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.
