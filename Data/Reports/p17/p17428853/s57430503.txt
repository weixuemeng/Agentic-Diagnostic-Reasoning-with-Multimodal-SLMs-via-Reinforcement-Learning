                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Newly placed left pacemaker is present, with leads in the regions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle, with no visible pneumothorax. 
 Extensive fibrosis is present throughout the right lung with associated marked
 volume loss, with shift of mediastinum and heart to the right.  Less extensive
 scarring or fibrosis is present within the left lung.  No pleural effusion or
 acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Permanent pacemaker leads in expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle with no pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Asymmetrically distributed interstitial lung disease much worse on the
 right than the left.  The patient carries a history of interstitial lung
 disease, and correlation with outside cross-sectional imaging would be helpful
 for a more complete characterization.
