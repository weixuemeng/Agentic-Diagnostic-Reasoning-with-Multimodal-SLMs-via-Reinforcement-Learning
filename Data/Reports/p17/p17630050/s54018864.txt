                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness and fatigue for seven days. 
 Evaluate for infiltrate versus edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker device is
 noted with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle in appropriate
 position. Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of
 bronchovascular markings. Cardiac silhouette appears mildly accentuated by
 lower lung volumes.  Opacification at the right lung base may represent
 atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bilateral low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings.
 2.  Opacification of the right lung base may represent atelectasis; however,
 infectious process such as pneumonia should be considered in the correct
 clinical setting.
