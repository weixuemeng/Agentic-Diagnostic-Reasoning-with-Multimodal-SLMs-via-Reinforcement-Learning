                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Central catheter.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly
 better inspiration, which may account for the decrease in transverse diameter
 of the heart.  Dual-channel pacemaker device remains in good position.  No
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion or acute pneumonia.
 
 Right IJ catheter has been introduced that extends to at least the mid portion
 of the SVC where it is obscured by the pacer device.  This was discussed with
 the ICU team when they visited the radiology department this morning.
