                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia, coughing ___ ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with
 fullness of the hila and AP window again suggestive of underlying
 lymphadenopathy. There appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Increased interstitial markings are again demonstrated with septal thickening
 at the periphery of both lung bases, suggestive of either an underlying
 interstitial lung disease or mild interstitial pulmonary edema, and appear
 similar compared to the prior exam.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.   No acute osseous abnormalities
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased peripheral and basilar
 interstitial opacities again may reflect mild interstitial pulmonary edema,
 but raise concern for a chronic interstitial lung disease, and findings appear
 somewhat similar compared to the prior chest radiograph.  Fullness of the hila
 and AP window are suggestive of lymphadenopathy.
