                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough, fatigue.  Assess for aspiration or pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Video oropharyngeal swallow ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately hyperinflated with a clear left lung. Tubular and
 heterogeneous radiopacities within the right lower lobe are consistent with
 aspirated contrast from prior oropharyngeal video swallow.  Right lower lobe
 atelectasis is noted.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.  Intact median sternotomy
 wires and sternal clips are consistent with prior history of CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Aspirated barium contrast within right lower lobe likely from recent
 oropharyngeal video swallow.
 2. No pneumonia.
