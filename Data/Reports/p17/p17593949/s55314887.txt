                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatocellular carcinoma, subacute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged.  The
 aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion with perihilar haziness, new compared to the prior exam. 
 Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, however,
 infection is not completely excluded. No large pleural effusion is identified
 although a trace left pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, new from the prior exam.
 
 2. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though
 infection cannot be excluded.  Possible trace left pleural effusion.
