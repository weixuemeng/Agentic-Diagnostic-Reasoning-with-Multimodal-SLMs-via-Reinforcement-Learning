 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly
 stable.  Pleural effusion, bilateral, right more than left, is small to
 moderate, better appreciated on the lateral view.  Right rib fractures are
 partially imaged.  No new consolidation to suggest interval development of
 infectious process has been demonstrated on the current examination.  Mild
 degree of interstitial edema cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
