                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p repair of perf'd duodenal ulcers now with nec fasc of
 perineum s/p debridement with ongoing sepsis; remains intubated  // eval for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 17 56
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip and side-port extending beneath diaphragm.  Tip extends beyond
 the edge of the film.  A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal
 SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Again seen is
 dense retrocardiac opacity obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Small left effusion is likely
 present.  There is patchy opacity at the right base, similar to the prior
 film, with trace blunting of the costophrenic angle.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 
 No free air detected beneath the diaphragms on this supine film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation patchy opacity right lung base
 and possible small bilateral effusions are similar to the prior study.
 
 Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF, also similar to the
 prior study.
