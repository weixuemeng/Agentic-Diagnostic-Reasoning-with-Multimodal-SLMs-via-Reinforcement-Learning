                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is no right-sided pleural effusion.  Slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on
 the left.  There is a patchy medial right lower lung opacity that appears
 streaky, suggestive of atelectasis, although not entirely specific. 
 Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky medial right lower lung opacity, which may be due to atelectasis in
 the right middle lobe, although an infectious etiology is not completely
 excluded.  Short-term followup PA and lateral views may be helpful, if
 clinically, indicated to reassess.
