                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain worsened with inspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs,
 consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and some regions of fibrotic change
 at the right base.  However, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia,
 vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 Of incidental note is an azygous fissure, of no clinical significance.
