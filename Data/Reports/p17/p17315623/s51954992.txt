 As compared to the previous radiograph, the ventilation of the left lung has
 substantially improved. However, the inferior part of the hemi thorax is still
 atelectatic and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is no evidence of a
 pleural drain on the left. On the right, the lung has increased in
 transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The pre-existing oval
 opacity is no longer seen
