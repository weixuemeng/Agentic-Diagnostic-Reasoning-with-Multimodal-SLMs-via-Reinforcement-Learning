 HISTORY:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged,
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Minimal linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is visualized.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
