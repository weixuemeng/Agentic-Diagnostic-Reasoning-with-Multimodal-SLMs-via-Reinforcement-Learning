 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bradycardia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate several external

 appears normal, allowing for low lung volumes.  The lungs remain clear without
 pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process such as
 pneumonia.
