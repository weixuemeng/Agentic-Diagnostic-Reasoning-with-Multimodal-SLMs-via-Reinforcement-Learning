 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Tachycardia, lightheadedness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The

 suprahilar rounded opacity is felt to represent a vessel on end.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
