  2. Interval increase in left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
  atelectasis.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 7:47 PM
  New right-sided PICC line terminates within the mid SVC.  A left-sided PICC
  line projects in unchanged location.  There is no pneumothorax.  Allowing for
  differences in lung volumes, small bilateral pleural effusions appear
  unchanged with slightly more prominent left-sided atelectasis or fluid
  extending into the fissure.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with CHF w/ L picc line leakge, s/p R picc placement, eval
 position of both picc lines (R is new, once R picc is confirmed, will remove L
 picc).
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The new right PICC line terminates within the mid SVC.  A left-sided PICC line
 projects in unchanged location, also terminating within the mid SVC.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Allowing for differences in lung volumes, small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  Linear atelectasis or a small amount of fluid
 extending into the fissure is slightly more prominent at the left base than on
 the prior study, suggesting an increase in left pleural effusion with
 compressive atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Sternotomy wires are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right PICC line terminates within the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 2. Interval increase in left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.
