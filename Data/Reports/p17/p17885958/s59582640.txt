 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:06 PM
  Swan-Ganz extends out of the pulmonary outflow track projecting over the right
  hilus likely within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax.
  Interval decrease in the left pleural effusion. New right lower lung
  opacification with some volume loss may reflect some degree of atelectasis;
  however, is concerning for superimposed pneumonia or aspiration in the correct
  clinical setting. The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
  on the telephone on ___ at 8:01 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___ lady with ischemic cardiomyopathy
 LVEF ___%s/p CBAG ___, DM, PAD who presented with dyspnea found to have acute
 on chronic CHF exacerbation  // s/p left thoracentesis, evaluated for pneumo
 and volume status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the level of the right lower lobe pulmonary
 artery and should be pulled back.  Heart size and mediastinum are stable in
 appearance. There is substantial interval decrease in the left pleural
 effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax and left basal areas of atelectasis.
 
 There is new wall right lower lobe consolidation and giving therapy VD is most
 likely consistent with aspiration. New pneumonia or hemorrhage would be less
 likely.  No right pneumothorax noted.
