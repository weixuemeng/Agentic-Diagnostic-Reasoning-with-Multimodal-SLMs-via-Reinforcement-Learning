                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dypsnea,  // acute cardiopulm disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Film from earlier the same day performed at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are hazy bibasilar opacities which could be in part due to technique and
 overlying soft tissues although there is more dense opacity in the
 retrocardiac region. Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits given positioning and
 technique. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible retrocardiac opacity for which dedicated PA and lateral may help
 further characterize if patient is amenable.
