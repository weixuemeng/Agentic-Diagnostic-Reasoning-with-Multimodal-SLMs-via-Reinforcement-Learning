 ill-defined nodular opacities most pronounced in the lung bases, not
 substantially changed in the interval, with no new focal consolidation clearly
 evident.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated with scarring
 noted at the lung apices.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There are
