                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is persistent opacity
 of reticular character with prior bronchial cuffing and probably mild volume
 loss within the right lower lobe, but this was the case before and appears
 less severe.  An area of right mid lung scarring and nodular appears
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent but improved right basilar opacity, which may indicate residual
 scarring from prior infection, although recurring infection at the same site
 as before is not excluded.
