                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough  // r/o infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Biapical pleural thickening is re- demonstrated.  There are
 increased bilateral lower lung opacities worrisome for pneumonia.  A more
 focal opacity in the right mid lung was also present on the prior study.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased right mid to lower lung and left lower lung opacities worrisome for
 infection superimposed on chronic changes.
