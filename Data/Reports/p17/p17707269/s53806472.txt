                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recurrent bronchiectasis and MRSA pneumonia, shortness
 of breath, coarse right lower lobe breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Right
 basilar opacity and patchy opacity projecting over the right mid lung are
 worrisome for pneumonia.  There is also patchy lateral left base opacity,
 which may be due to chronic changes, although an additional site of infection
 is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable and stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity and to a lesser extent patchy opacities in the
 right mid lung are worrisome for pneumonia.  Subtle patchy lateral left base
 opacity may be due to chronic change/known bronchiectasis; however, additional
 site of infection is not excluded.
