                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior studies including most recent chest radiograph
 from ___ and CT chest without contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior radiograph from ___, there has been
 removal of the right arm PIC line.  Again seen is severe bronchiectasis
 affecting the right middle and lower lobes as well as the left lower lobe. 
 There maybe slight worsening of bronchiectasis in left lower lobe.  In the
 right upper lobe, just above the minor fissure, an ill-defined patchy opacity
 persists which may represent infectious process.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Lungs remain hyperexpanded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Osseous structures are intact.  A right PICC line has been
 removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in severe bronchiectasis in the right middle and
 right lower lobes.  Possible interval worsening in left lower lobe
 bronchiectasis.
 2.  Stable ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe may represent
 continuing infectious process.  No new focal consolidation.
