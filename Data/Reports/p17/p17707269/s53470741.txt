                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe bronchiectasis, cough, sputum for 6 weeks, evaluate for
 change in known chronic bronchiectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  Compared to prior study, there
 is an increase in opacities in the superior portion of the right lower lobe
 and the left lower lobe, as well as possibly in the medial portion of the
 right lower lobe.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in opacities in the right and left lower lobes likely
 represent mucoid impaction and pneumonia on a background of severe chronic
 bronchiectasis.
