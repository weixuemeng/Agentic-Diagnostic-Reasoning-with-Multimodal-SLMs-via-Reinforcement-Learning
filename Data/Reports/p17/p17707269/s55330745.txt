                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of bronchiectasis, now presenting
 with fever.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___ and chest
 CT from ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a catheter external to the patient
 overlying the upper right chest extending across the midline.  A previously
 seen PICC line has been removed in the interval.  Diffuse bronchiectasis
 within the lung bases, right greater than left, appears similar to prior
 radiographic and CT examinations.  However, on the lateral view, there is
 increased density projecting over the spine, which is concerning for
 superimposed infection given patient's clinical history.  This likely
 correlates with subtle increased density in the right lung base on the frontal
 view.  Upper lungs remain clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffuse basilar bronchiectasis, right greater than left, unchanged from
 prior.
 
 2.  Increased right lower lobe opacity raises concern for acute infection
