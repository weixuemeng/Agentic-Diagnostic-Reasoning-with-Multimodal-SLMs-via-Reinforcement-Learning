                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lungs
 remain hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency, likely reflecting underlying
 emphysema.  There is mild residual opacity at the right and left lung base,
 which could represent pneumonia versus scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 stable.  Bony structures intact.
