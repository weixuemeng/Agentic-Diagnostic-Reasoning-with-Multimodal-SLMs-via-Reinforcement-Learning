                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Severe bronchiectasis, prolonged IV antibiotic administration,
 assessment for progression.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is in
 unchanged position.  The areas of scattered infection in both lungs,
 appreciated both on the frontal and on the lateral radiograph, have decreased
 in extent and severity.  Extensive bronchiectatic changes, however, are still
 clearly visible.  At the bases of the right upper lobe, a scar in the lung
 parenchyma is visualized.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
