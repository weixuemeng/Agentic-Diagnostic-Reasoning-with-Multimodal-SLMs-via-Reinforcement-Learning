                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  None.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Opacities in the
 right middle lobe and lingula have improved since the prior study and appear
 very similar to the earlier comparison examination suggesting chronic
 abnormality.  Superimposed infection is difficult to exclude, however. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right basilar opacity which has improved since the last study and
 may be compatible with chronic background finding; superimposed infection is
 not excluded however.
