                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe bronchiectasis, on antibiotics.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some decrease in the
 opacification at the bases.  This could reflect some improvement in the
 pneumonia that has been a supervening factor in a patient with diffuse severe
 bilateral bronchiectatic changes in the lower lung zones.  Hyperexpansion of
 the lungs is again consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
 
 Central catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
