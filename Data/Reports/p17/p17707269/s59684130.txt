 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in stable position.  Persistent hyperinflation of
 the lungs is re- demonstrated.  Left base opacity is persistent.  Right mid to
 lower lung opacities may be minimally improved, but persist.  There is slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle new since the prior study, which could
 be due to a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.

 Right mid to lower lung and left base opacities have slightly improved in the
 interval, but persist.
