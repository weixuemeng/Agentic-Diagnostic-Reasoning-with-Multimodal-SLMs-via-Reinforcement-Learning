                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M POD #___ s/p hemicolectomy and SBR, now p/w hypoxia and
 increased o2 requirement  // r/o acute pulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   ___ portable chest radiograph

 edema.  The heart size is top normal.  There are no acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Increased bibasilar opacities are more consistent with worsening bibasilar
 atelectasis; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, an evolving
 pneumonia may be considered.
 2. Endotracheal tube seen in ___ chest radiograph has been removed.
