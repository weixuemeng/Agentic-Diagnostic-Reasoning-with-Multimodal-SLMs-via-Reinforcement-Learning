 TECHNIQUE: Chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There are patchy streaky opacities within the lingula and left
 lower lobe, which may reflect early pneumonia although atelectasis could also
 be considered.  Moderate anterior osteophytes are present along the visualized
 lower thoracic spine.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacities in the left lower lung, which may reflect
 pneumonia in the appropriate setting.
