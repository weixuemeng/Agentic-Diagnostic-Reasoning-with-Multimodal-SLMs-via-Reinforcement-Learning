 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. The heart was moderately enlarged on the prior study but has since
 normalized, suggesting in the setting of the acute illness on the prior study
 there was cardiac enlargement perhaps due to a pericardial effusion.
