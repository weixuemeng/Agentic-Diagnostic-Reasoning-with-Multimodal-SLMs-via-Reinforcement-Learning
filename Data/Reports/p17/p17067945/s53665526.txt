 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fever and confusion.  
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___ chest x-ray and CT ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Increasing retrocardiac opacities are
 due to increasing atelectasis.  Irregular mainly peripheral opacities in the
 upper lobes bilaterally are better seen in prior CT, they may be due to
 sarcoidosis or previous granulomatous infection.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large effusion.  Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
