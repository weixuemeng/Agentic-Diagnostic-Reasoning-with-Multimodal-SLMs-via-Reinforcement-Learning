                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient is status post MVC, eval interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the
 patient in semi-upright position.
 
 A left subclavian line terminates in the mid SVC.  There are new increased
 opacities in the left retrocardiac region.  Again seen are unchanged bilateral
 upper lung peripheral opacities, consistent with prior sarcoidosis.  There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  A known comminuted fracture of
 the right humerus is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left retrocardiac opacification which may reflect atelectasis
 or an early consolidation.
