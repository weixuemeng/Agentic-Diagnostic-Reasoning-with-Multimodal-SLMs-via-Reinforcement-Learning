                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Clogged OG tube replacement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An OG/NG type tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, overlying expected site
 of fundus.  The sideport lies in the region of the EG junction, possibly
 slightly proximal to it.  The ET tube is in satisfactory position,
 approximately 3.7 cm above the carina.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  No acute superimposed
 process is identified.  Rib fractures again noted.
