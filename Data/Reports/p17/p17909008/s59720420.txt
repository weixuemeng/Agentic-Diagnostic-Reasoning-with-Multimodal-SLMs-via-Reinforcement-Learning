 nominal position in relation to the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip
 extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  The heart is not enlarged.
 There is borderline upper zone redistribution, but no CHF.  There is minimal
 patchy opacity at the left base, unchanged, presumably atelectasis and
 scarring.  No new infiltrate.  No effusion is identified.  
 
 Multiple left-sided old rib fractures are noted.  Small focal densities seen
 in the left mid zone laterally in relation to the left seventh and eighth ribs
 are thought to represent old rib fractures. There is definitely an old rib
 fracture involving the left ninth rib laterally.
