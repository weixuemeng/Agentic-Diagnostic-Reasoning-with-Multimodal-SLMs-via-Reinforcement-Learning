                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 portable AP views of the chest.  The lungs are hyperinflated as on prior
 with coarse interstitial markings suggestive of chronic underlying lung
 disease.  More focal opacities projecting over the left lung are compatible
 with callus formation from interval, healing rib fractures involving the
 posterior left ___ ___ and 9th ribs.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  No definite acute osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
