 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient status post lobectomy with

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a subtle density at the
 medial right lung base.  In the right clinical setting, this could represent
 an early right middle lobe pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacity at the medial right lung base could represent an early right
 middle lobe pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
