 Interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of mediastinal
 shift.  The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged and there is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent
 with some pulmonary edema.  Opacification at the left base with obscuration of
 the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 at the at 1 or both bases would have to be considered.
 The PICC line extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
