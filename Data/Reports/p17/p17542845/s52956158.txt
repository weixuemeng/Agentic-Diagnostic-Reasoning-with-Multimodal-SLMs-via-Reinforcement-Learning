 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known CLL, now with cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a relevant change.
 At the level of the right azygos lobe, a new mass-like parenchymal
 consolidation in epihilar and paramediastinal location has newly appeared. 
 The lesion causes partial obliteration of the paratracheal stripe and an
 enlargement of the mediastinum.
 
 In addition, there is new enlargement of the left hilus, presumably caused by
 lymph nodes.  The changes are well documented on the previous CT examination
 of the chest performed on ___.
 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
