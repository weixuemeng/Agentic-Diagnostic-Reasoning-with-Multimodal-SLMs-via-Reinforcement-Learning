                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sob/dizziness  // ? Acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  More obvious on today's examination than on the previous film
 is a slight increase in vascular diameters, likely reflecting mild pulmonary
 edema.  A scar in the right lower lung is constant in appearance. Neither the
 frontal nor the lateral radiograph give evidence of pleural effusions.
