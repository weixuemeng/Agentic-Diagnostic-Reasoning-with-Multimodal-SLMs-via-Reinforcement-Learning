                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Febrile, neutropenic spike, question infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.. Additional post-rpocessed version generated. 
 No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for comparison.  
 
 A right-sided Port-A-Cath type catheter is present, with tip over mid SVC.  An
 additional left-sided central line tip overlies the distal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. 
 Tubing overlies the left lung upper zone accounting for linear opacities
 there.  No effusion.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary nodule is detected.  
 
 No obvious focal lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.  Limited assessment of
 bowel gas in the upper abdomen is grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chest x-ray examination within normal limits.  No focal
 infiltrate identified.  Please note that early infection in the setting of
 neutropenia may be radiographically occult.
