                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with vomiting, new hypoxia, evaluate for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 EKG leads overlie the chest.  The patient is rotated to the right on the
 current exam.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The
 hila are unremarkable.  There is diffuse left lung patchy/hazy airspace
 opacity which appears worsened/new in comparison to earlier same-day CT of the
 chest even when allowing for inter-modality differences.  The right lung is
 grossly clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although possibly at least in part due to technical factors, new hazy left
 lung airspace opacities raise the possibility of aspiration in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
