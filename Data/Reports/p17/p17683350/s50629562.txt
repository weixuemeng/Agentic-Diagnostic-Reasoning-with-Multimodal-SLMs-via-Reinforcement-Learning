                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with sepsis fluid overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient has been extubated.  NG tube and right jugular line has been
 removed.
 
 Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has improved, but residual right
 perihilar heterogeneous opacity and left lower lung consolidation are
 worrisome for pneumonia.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated in this patient with known centrilobular
 emphysema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has improved.
 2.  Remaining heterogeneous right perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are
 worrisome for pneumonia.
