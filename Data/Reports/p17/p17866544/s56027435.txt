                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with quadrapelegia, recurrent aspiration PNA,
 collapsed L lung, s/p bronch  // interval change, L lung (collapsed/improved
 post- bronch)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, a previously nodular opacity in the
 left lung has massively increased in extent.  The opacities ill-defined and
 seen on both the frontal and lateral radiograph.  The opacities located in the
 apical portions of the left lower lobe and in the lingular.  Air bronchograms
 are visualized.  The findings would be consistent with post bronchoscopy
 changes or aspiration pneumonia.  However, in the absence of cross-sectional
 imaging documentation, close radiographic followup is required and complete
 resolution of the changes should be documented, to exclude a chronic
 parenchymal process or an underlying neoplasm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were posted on the radiology dashboard.
