 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 re-expansion of the left lung, presumably related to expectoration of a mucous
 followup.  Nevertheless, there is still substantial retrocardiac opacification
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, probably associated with a
 small effusion.
 The right lung is essentially clear.
