                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVA with trach now with LLL collapse s/p
 bronchoscopy  // Assess for interval change      Assess for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in
 the left lower lobe collapse and effusion at the left base.  Atelectatic
 changes have developed at the right base.
 There is the vague suggestion of some increased opacification in the left
 perihilar region.  Some of this probably represents the overlapping left
 scapula.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 could be considered.
