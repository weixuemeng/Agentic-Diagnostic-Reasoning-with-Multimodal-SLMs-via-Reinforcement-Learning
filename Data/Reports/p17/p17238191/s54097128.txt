                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with esophageal food bolus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The esophagus is markedly distended, suggesting a distal food impaction.
 
 Patchy opacities at the right base likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidations.  No pulmonary edema.  Stable appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion.  Surgical clips are seen within the
 neck bilaterally due to prior thyroidectomy.  Multiple right lateral rib
 fractures are re- demonstrated.  Chronic anterior subluxation of the humeral
 head with respect to the glenoid bilaterally, stable.  Status post
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The esophagus is markedly distended, suggesting distal food impaction.  No
 evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
 2. Patchy opacification at the right base, likely atelectasis.
 3. Small left pleural effusion.
