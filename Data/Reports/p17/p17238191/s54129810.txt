 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.  Shoulder films from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hypoinflated, likely accentuating the size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous.  Surgical clips

 changes noted at the right shoulder.  Right-sided rib fractures are noted
 involving right upper ribs.  Right lower rib and left anterior second and
 third rib fractures are also noted.  These are apparently new from the prior
 study from ___.  The upper rib fractures are not clearly delineated on
 shoulder films from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small left pleural effusion.  No focal lung consolidation.
 2. Apparent anterior dislocation at the left shoulder.
 3. Multiple right lateral rib fractures involving right upper and lower ribs
 are mildly displaced.  Left second and third rib fractures.  Some of these are
 may be chronic; though not visualized in ___ correlate with tenderness
 on physical exam at these locations.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings above including modification to preliminary report
 (minus left rib fractures) were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
