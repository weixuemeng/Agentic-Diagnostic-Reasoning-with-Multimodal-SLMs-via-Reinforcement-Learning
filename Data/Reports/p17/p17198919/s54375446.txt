                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough productive of green blood-tinged sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Linear increased opacity projecting over the heart on the
 lateral view is most likely vascular crowding due to lower lung volumes. 
 There is no corresponding area on the frontal view; otherwise, the lungs are
 clear.  Normal heart, mediastinum, and pleural surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacification overlying the heart on the lateral view is
 likely due to vascular crowding.  If there is strong clinical suspicion of
 pneumonia, oblique views would be helpful in making a more confident
 assessment.
