  Improved pulmonary edema.  Persistent small left and moderate right pleural
  effusions.  Overlying consolidation is again noted at the right lung base and
  a infection at this location cannot be excluded.  Heart size remains enlarged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again a moderate
 right and small left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases.  The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears to be somewhat
 improved.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
