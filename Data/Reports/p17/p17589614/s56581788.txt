                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESLD, displaced feeding tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___, 8:29 a.m.  
 
 No orogastric tube is detected on the current exam.  A left-sided PICC line is
 present, tip over upper right atrium, unchanged. Clinical correlation regading
 possible retraction is requested. 
 
 Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Diffusely increased vascular
 interstitial and alveolar markings in both lungs, bilateral effusions, and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation appear similar to the prior film.
 More confluent opacity is again seen in the left mid/upper zone. Clips or
 sutures are faintly seen in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared with the prior film.  No
 orogastric-type tube identified.
