                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left upper lobe opacity of unclear etiology on CT, resolved, now
 readmitted for SBP with cough and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the study from 12 hours prior, there has been some
 increase in the bilateral pleural effusions.  The heart continues to be
 moderately enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution.  The
 impression is that of fluid overload.  An underlying infectious infiltrate
 cannot be excluded.
