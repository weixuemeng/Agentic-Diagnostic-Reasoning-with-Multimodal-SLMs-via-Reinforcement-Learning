                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with past medical history of cirrhosis now with
 increasing shortness of breath and abdominal pain.  Evaluate for worsening
 pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___ and CT chest without
 contrast from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  Compared to ___, there is improvement
 although not complete resolution of the diffuse interstitial thickening
 bilaterally with mild engorgement of the hila and associated bilateral pleural
 effusions compatible with pulmonary edema.  No focal opacities are identified.
 Cardiomediastinal contour cannot be properly assessed due to obscuring of the
 heart silhouette by layering effusions and bibasilar atelectases.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema with associated pleural effusions.
