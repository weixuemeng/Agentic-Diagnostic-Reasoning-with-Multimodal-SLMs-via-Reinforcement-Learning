                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ataxia  // ?Aspiration      ?Aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images. The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular
 congestion or pleural effusion. Small amount of increased opacification in the
 retrocardiac region most likely represents atelectasis with associated
 blunting of the costophrenic angle. However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
