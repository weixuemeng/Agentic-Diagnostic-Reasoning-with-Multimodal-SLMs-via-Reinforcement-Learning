                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evidence of aspiration.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:27 p.m.
 
 The lateral portion of the left diaphragm and extreme right costophrenic angle
 are excluded from the film.  
 
 Tubing projects over the mediastinum, presumably some orogastric tubing, which
 extends to the inferior edge of this film, but, based on the field of view,
 cannot be confirmed to extend beyond the GE junction. Tubing previously seen
 over the upper mediastinum is no longer visualized or has been advanced. A
 right IJ central line has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
 enlarged.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring,
 consistent with CHF and interstitial edema.  Increased retrocardiac density
 and atelectasis at the right base are both unchanged. Probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions, difficult to conclusively assess in light of positioning of
 the film.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Compared to the prior film, the CHF findings are worse. Bibasilar opacities
 are similar.
