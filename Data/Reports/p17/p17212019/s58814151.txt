                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There may be mild pulmonary
 hyperinflation.
 
 A nodule is projected between the ninth tenth ribs on the left side, possibly
 representing a nipple and a less-defined nodule on the contralateral right
 side is seen.  The visualized osseous structures appear grossly normal.  There
 is some irregularity about the right tenth rib posteriorly which represnets a
 fracture as  previously present.  There is no good evidence of pneumonia as
 clinically questioned.
 
 COCLUSION:
 
 No acute findings.
 
 Bilateral small nodules, likely reflective of nipples.
 
 Reviews of prior radiographs shows that the right-sided rib fractures are
 chronic
