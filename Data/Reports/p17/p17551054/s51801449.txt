                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Renal cell carcinoma with pulmonary involvement, chest pain
 twinge after Sutent chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The cardiac
 silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary vascularity
 is not engorged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Linear
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Previously noted
 pulmonary nodules are not clearly demonstrated on chest radiograph.  Nipple
 shadows are seen bilaterally.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.
