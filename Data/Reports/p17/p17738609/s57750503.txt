                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta appears mildly tortuous. 
 Remainder the mediastinal contour is on remarkable.  The hila appear prominent
 bilaterally, which suggests enlargement of the pulmonary arteries.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes seen in the upper lobes. 
 Linear and patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis with scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysema with bibasilar linear and patchy airspace opacities, likely
 atelectasis or scarring, although infection cannot be excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally may
 suggest underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
