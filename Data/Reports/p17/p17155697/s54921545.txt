                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old-man with history of metastatic myxoid liposarcoma
 with known right pleural metastases.  Patient is status post right thoracotomy
 for pleural mass resection.  Assess for lung reexpansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___; most recent
 from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right chest tube is in unchanged
 position.  There is persistent opacity within the right lung base, which is
 similar in severity compared to recent prior, likely a combination of
 post-surgical atelectasis and pleural fluid.  Overall aeration of the right
 lung is unchanged.  The left lung remains essentially clear.  Post-surgical
 changes within the left base are noted.  There is decreased pulmonary vascular
 congestion as compared to most recent prior.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right lower lobe opacity related to recent thoracotomy
 and pleural mass resections.  Overall unchanged aeration of the lungs. 
 Slightly decreased edema.
