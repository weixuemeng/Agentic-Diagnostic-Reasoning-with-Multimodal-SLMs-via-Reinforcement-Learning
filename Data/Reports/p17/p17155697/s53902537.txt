 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate sized, loculated right pleural effusion and right pleural
 masses are similar in appearance to the previous radiograph.  Loculated
 hydropneumothoraces in the apicolateral right pleural surface and in the
 anterior retrosternal region on the lateral view are unchanged as well as
 right middle and lower lung opacities. Linear left lower lobe atelectasis is
 also similar.
