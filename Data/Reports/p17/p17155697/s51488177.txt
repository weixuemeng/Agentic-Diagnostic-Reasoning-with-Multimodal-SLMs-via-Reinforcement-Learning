                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with metastatic myxoid liposarcoma status post
 right lower anterior rib resection.  Assess for hemothorax or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___, ___, MRI chest of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right pleural effusion and a sharply demarcated
 homogeneous noncalcified opacity the density of soft tissue in the right lower
 lobe obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. On the lateral view it is seen as a
 triangular sharply demarcated opacity projecting posterior to the left
 ventricle with likely opacification of the right middle lobe.  No additional
 focal opacity, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or left pleural effusion.  Heart
 size, mediastinal contour and hila are normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Small right pleural effusion. 
 2. Homogeneous sharply demarcated triangular opacity is likely a soft tissue
 density and may be  fluid collected posterior to the graft. 
 3. No pneumothorax.
