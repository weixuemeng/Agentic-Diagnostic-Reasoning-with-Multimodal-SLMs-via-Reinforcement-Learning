                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracotomy and mass resection, assess for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph.  Lungs are low in volume with right
 apically directed chest tube redemonstrated.  Persistent basilar opacity
 likely relates to a combination of atelectasis, pleural effusion and surgical
 changes after pleural mass resection.  Aeration of the right lung nodule is
 unchanged with increasing left basal opacity suggesting atelectasis.  No
 pleural effusion is identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No pulmonary edema seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged right basal opacity reflecting a combination of
 atelectasis, effusion postsurgical changes.  Slight increase in left basilar
 atelectasis.  Resolved edema.
