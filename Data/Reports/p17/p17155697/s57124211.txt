 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic myxoid sarcoma, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared,
 huge, approximately 7 cm large right dorsal lesion.  The lesion abuts the
 pleura and is likely to represent a metastatic disease.  The marked elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No
 other lung lesions.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, the finding was entered into the
 Radiology dashboard system.
