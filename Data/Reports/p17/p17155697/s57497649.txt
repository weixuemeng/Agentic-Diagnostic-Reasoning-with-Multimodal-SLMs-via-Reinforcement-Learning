                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left thoracotomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, with the left chest tube
 removed, there is no definite pneumothorax, though a small pneumothorax could
 possibly be hidden due to superimposition of bony structures overlying the
 left apex.  The lungs are free of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. 
 Continued opacification at the right base.
