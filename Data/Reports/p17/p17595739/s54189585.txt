                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Bilateral patchy opacities in the context of fever and
 cough may relate to multifocal pneumonia, possibly superimposed on mild
 pulmonary edema.  Patchy right middle lobe opacity is also worrisome for
 consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
