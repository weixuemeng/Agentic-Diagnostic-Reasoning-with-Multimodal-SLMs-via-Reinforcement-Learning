                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with overdose and assault.  Evaluation for
 fracture.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, accentuating the heart size, which appears mildly enlarged, which may
 also be partially due to imaging technique.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax identified within the lungs. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is present.  The osseous structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
