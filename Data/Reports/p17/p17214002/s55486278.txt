                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph is somewhat limited by rotation to the
 left.  However, it does ___ lung volumes with mild pulmonary interstitial
 edema.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 difficult to ascertain.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.  Low lung volumes limit study and
 PA/lateral radiographs are recommended.
