                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough, fever, and left greater than right crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear normal. There is a medial right posterior basilar opacity in the right
 lower lobe consistent with pneumonia, in addition to opacification of the
 lingula suggesting an infectious consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities in the lingula and right lower lobe suggesting
 pneumonia.  Follow-up chest radiographs are recommended in six to eight weeks
 in order to show resolution.
