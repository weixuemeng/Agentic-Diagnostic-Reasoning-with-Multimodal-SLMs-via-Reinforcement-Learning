                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evacuation of right neck hematoma, ET tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  There are
 surgical ___ over right neck, with subcutaneous emphysema there.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly.    There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is patchy opacity at both lung bases,
 consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, this could also reflect changes due to aspiration.  No gross effusion
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval surgical changes at the left neck.
 2.  COPD and cardiomegaly, grossly stable.
 3.  CHF with interstitial edema.
 4.  Patchy opacities at both lung bases.
 5.  No pneumothorax detected.
