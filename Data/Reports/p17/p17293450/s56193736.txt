  1. Endotracheal tube terminates 7.4 cm carina, and the enteric tube terminates
  at the GE junction.  Both support devices should be advanced for optimal
  placement.
  2. New widespread parenchymal opacities may represent severe pulmonary edema,
  ARDS, widespread pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage, depending on the clinical
  circumstances.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp distress leading to intubation, confirm
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP supine view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 7.4 cm from the carina, and the enteric tube
 terminates at the GE junction, the should be advanced for optimal placement.
 
 Short interval development of widespread pulmonary airspace opacities, likely
 accentuated somewhat by low lung volumes, representing severe pulmonary edema,
 ARDS, widespread pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.  Allowing for differences in rotation, the
 cardiomediastinal contour is stable.  The upper abdomen and osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 7.4 cm carina, and the enteric tube terminates
 at the GE junction.  Both support devices should be advanced for optimal
 placement.
 2. New widespread parenchymal opacities may represent severe pulmonary edema,
 ARDS, widespread pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage, depending on the clinical
 circumstances.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. 
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 12:14 AM, 2 minutes after the
 discovery of the findings.
