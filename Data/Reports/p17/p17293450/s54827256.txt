                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ett  // ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, earlier today, at 14:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm
 above the level of the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out
 of the field of view.  There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings, however, bilateral perihilar highly areolar
 opacities raise concern for developing pulmonary edema.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable given differences in patient position and inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the level the carina.  Enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm, out of the field view.
 
 Low lung volumes accentuates the vascular markings, however, bilateral
 perihilar alveolar opacities raise concern for developing pulmonary edema,
 underlying aspiration not excluded.
