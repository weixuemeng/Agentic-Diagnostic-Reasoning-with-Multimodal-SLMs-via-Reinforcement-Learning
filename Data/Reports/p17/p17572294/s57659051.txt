 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contour is unchanged
 with atherosclerotic calcifications and tortuosity of the aorta again noted. 
 There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, worse in the interval with
 increased size of small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is
 identified. There are moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.

 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
