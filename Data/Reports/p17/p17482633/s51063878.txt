                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior outside hospital chest radiographs dated ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the immediate prior study low lung volumes and a more lordotic
 technique cause bronchovascular crowding and apparent increased cardiomegaly. 
 These changes are felt to be technical.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema.  The left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for differences in lung volumes and patient positioning, no acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
