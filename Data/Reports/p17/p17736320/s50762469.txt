                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pulmonary edema and heart failure. Please
 evaluate for pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes, and the heart is moderately enlarged.  Vascular
 congestion is accompanied by bilateral reticular opacities in the mid and
 lower lungs as well as superimposed heterogenous consolidatin in the right mid
 and lower lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Right mid and lower lung heterogeneous consolidation may represent
 pneumonia or asymmetrical edema, likely superimposed upon chronic underlying
 fibrotic lung disease.  Recommend short term follow up PA and lateral chest
 radiograph following diuresis.  HRCT may be helpful for more complete
 characterization of the interstitium.
