                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recurrent aspiration pneumonias, now with
 decreased breath sounds on the left.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left lower lobe opacities are definitely present; however, in
 comparison to the most recent prior film, they are probably improving.  Right
 lower lobe opacities are certainly improving with a much clearer visualization
 of the diaphragm today than on the prior film.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta
 is slightly tortuous.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near-complete resolution of the right-sided opacities.  Continued
 left- sided opacities which are improving compared to the most recent prior
 radiograph.
