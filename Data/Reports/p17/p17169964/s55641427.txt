                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male chronic aspiration.  NPO with G-tube in place. 
 Increased cough.  No fever.  Question pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___ and chest CT
 scans, most recently CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previous severe consolidation in both lower lungs has improved, but there is
 still extensive consolidative abnormality at both lung bases particular the
 right where it extends more laterally than before.    There is a decrease in
 profusion of small nodular opacities due to a combination of impacted bronchi
 and bronchiolar inflammation, all due to aspiration.  One region where
 consolidation has not cleared, in the right mid-lung, presumably superior
 segment of the lower lobe at the level of the carina.
 
 Right apical radiation change, stable.  
 
 Normal cardiac silhouette.  No appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Generalized improvement of previously severe bibasilar pneumonia, widespread
 bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis, with the exception of the lateral aspect of
 the right lung which is more severely affected, and the stable consolidation
 in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.
 
 Right apical radiation change, stable.
