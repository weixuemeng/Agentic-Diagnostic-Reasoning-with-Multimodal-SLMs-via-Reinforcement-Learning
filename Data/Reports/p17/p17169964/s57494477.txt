                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia shortness of breath, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Single portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates worsening
 right middle and right lower lobe airspace consolidation. There has also been
 overall worsening left lower lobe opacification, although a peripheral left
 basilar opacity has improved.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral lower lung airspace opacities, likely due to
 recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Please see subsequently dictated CT for more
 complete characterization.
 
 Recommend follow up CXR to demonstrate clearing in response to therapy in
 order to exclude a more chronic process including lung adenocarcinoma.
