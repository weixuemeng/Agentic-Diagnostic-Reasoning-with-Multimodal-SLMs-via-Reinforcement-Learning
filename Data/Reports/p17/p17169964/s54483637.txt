                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest congestion and shortness of breath. Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from ___. Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior CT, there is increased opacification in the right lower lobe,
 concerning for pneumonia, likely aspiration related. Additionally, there is an
 opacity in the left lower lobe, which is similar to the prior CT and chest
 radiograph, which could be related to findings of chronic aspiration, though a
 component of active infection cannot be completely excluded.  There is no
 pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia, likely aspiration
 related.  A left lower lobe opacity is unchanged from prior exam, and may be
 the sequelae of chronic aspiration. A superimposed active infection cannot be
 completely excluded.
