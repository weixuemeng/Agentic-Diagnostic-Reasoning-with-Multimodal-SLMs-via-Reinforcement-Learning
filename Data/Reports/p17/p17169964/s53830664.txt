                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, resolution surveillance.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right lower lobe
 pneumonia is slightly denser than before, potentially reflecting ongoing
 organization o f the pathologic process.  However, there also is a newly
 appeared parenchymal opacity at the bases of the left lung, located both in
 the lingula and in the left lower lobe.  The opacity is similar to the
 contralateral parenchymal process and very likely reflects infection.
 
 Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged.
 
 Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal appearance of the mediastinal
 structures.  Extensive known and pre-described deformities in the region of
 the right clavicle.
