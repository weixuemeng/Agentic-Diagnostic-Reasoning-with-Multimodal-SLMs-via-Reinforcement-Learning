                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post CABG, evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  Median sternotomy
 wires are intact.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax has nearly resolved.  A
 tiny left apical pneumothorax has in retrospect become smaller than the prior
 study. Lung volumes are slightly low with multifocal linear atelectasis which
 has improved since the prior exam.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  Imaged upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Near resolution of tiny bilateral apical pneumothoraces.
 2.  Improved multifocal atelectasis.
