                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male, status post CABG.  Patient is status post
 recent chest tube removal.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There has been interval removal of
 bilateral chest tubes after cardiac surgery.  There is a small right apical
 pneumothorax.  No left-sided pneumothorax is evident.  There are ongoing
 basilar opacities, though slightly decreased compared to most recent prior
 examination, likely a combination of atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The upper lobes are clear.  There is an expected postoperative
 appearance of cardiomediastinal contours.  Median sternotomy closure devices
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of bilateral chest tubes.  New small right apical
 pneumothorax.
 2.  Improved aeration of the lung bases, though with some persistent
 atelectasis and small bilateral effusions.
