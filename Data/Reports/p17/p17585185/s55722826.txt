 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of asthma, shortness of breath, and cough, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:31 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a lesser
 inspiratory effort.  As a consequence, the size of the cardiac silhouette
 appears larger than on the previous exam.  However, there is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No other acute or
 chronic changes.
