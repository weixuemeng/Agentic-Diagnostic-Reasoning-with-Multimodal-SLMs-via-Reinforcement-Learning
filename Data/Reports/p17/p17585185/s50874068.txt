                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of tracheobronchomalacia, severe
 asthma, and recent ICU admission, presenting with crushing chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Chain sutures are
 noted within both lung bases compatible with prior lung resections.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right, may reflect areas of
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right, may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
