 recurrent pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph performed earlier in the day at 5:10.

 apical pneumothorax is seen at this time.  Surgical suture chains are seen
 along the lateral aspect of the right lung fields.  The left lung remains
 clear.  The mediastinum and cardiac silhouettes remain unchanged and within
 normal limits.
 
 Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.

 No residual right-sided pneumothorax visualized, with pigtail catheter
 remaining in place.
