                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  ICD with left ventricular pacing lead remains in place.  Persistent
 cardiomegaly but worsening pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by
 interstitial edema.  More confluent lower lobe opacities have also worsened in
 the interval, and could be due to developing pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  These findings appear to be superimposed on chronic basilar
 fibrotic lung disease, and note is made of extensive calcified granulomas in
 the upper lobes, as well as an incompletely characterized asymmetrical opacity
 in the right apex, more fully characterized with recommendations for followup
 on the prior radiograph of earlier the same date.
