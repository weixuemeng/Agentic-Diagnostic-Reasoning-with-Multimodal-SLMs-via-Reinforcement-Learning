                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pulmonary congestion in a pedestrian struck by a
 motor vehicle, initially  with a left pneumothorax and intubated. Now
 extubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral upright views of the chest were obtained.  Compared
 to the prior examination, there is improved lung expansion as well as interval
 decrease in bilateral pulmonary opacities.  Retrocardiac opacification remains
 and could be due to aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis.  Left lower lung
 linear opacities likely represent atelectasis.  The bones and soft tissues are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion.  Residual
 opacities at the left base are most likely due to atelectasis, however, but
 there could be superimposed aspiration or pneumonia.
