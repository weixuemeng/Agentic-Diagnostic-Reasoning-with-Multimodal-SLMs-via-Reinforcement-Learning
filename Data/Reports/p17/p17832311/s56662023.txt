                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to possibly minimally enlarged given AP
 technique, although appears similar as compared to the prior study.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute chest abnormality.
 2.  Again seen top normal to possibly minimally enlarged cardiac silhouette
 given AP technique; as mentioned on the prior study cardiac silhouette size
 warrants further evaluation if not performed since the prior study.
