                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath status post CABG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  Mild enlargement of cardiac
 silhouette persists.  There are calcifications of the aortic arch.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Linear opacities within the lung bases most
 likely reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly
 likely reflects the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities. 
 Multilevel mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Extensive degenerative changes are also noted within the glenohumeral joints
 bilaterally, partially imaged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
