                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with small right lung infiltrate, thought to be
 ___ aspiration pneumonitis, looking for interval improvement  // eval interval
 change     eval interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ and
 ___.
 
 Heterogeneous opacification in a large volume of the right perihilar lung from
 the axillary to the basal regions has increased since first appearing on
 ___.  Small region of similar abnormality in the left midlung has
 developed subsequently and also progressed.  Because of the asymmetry,
 aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are more likely than pulmonary
 edema, but I note that cardiomegaly increased substantially between ___ and ___ and is larger subsequently suggesting worsening
 cardiomyopathy.  Acute mitral regurgitation, particularly, can produce
 asymmetric edema this severe.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the right, surprisingly decreased
 on the left.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads continuous from the
 left pectoral generator.
