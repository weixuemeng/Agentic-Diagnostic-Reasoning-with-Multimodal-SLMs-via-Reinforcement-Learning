                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with R empyema s/p VATS decortication and chest
 tube placement  // eval chest tube placement, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently performed on ___ at 23:05 ; chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two right-sided chest tubes enter the thoracic cage laterally and adjacent
 towards the head of the clavicle, terminating at the level of the aortic arch.
 Anterior-posterior location cannot be assessed by frontal radiography. 
 Left-sided PICC terminates near the mid SVC.
 
 Notable improvement in opacification of the right hemithorax in the short
 interval since the prior radiograph, most consistent with resolving pulmonary
 edema.  Mild background pulmonary edema on the left is stable.  Other than
 minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, there is no focal consolidation. 
 Small amount of fluid in the right minor fissure has increased.  Stable mild
 cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild generalized interstitial edema, improved on the right.
 2. Stable positioning of the right-sided chest tubes, although
 anterior-posterior location is unknown.  A lateral CXR could be considered for
 clarification of their position.
