                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever, leukocytosis, recent URI. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right paratracheal opacity is
 again seen, present since at least ___, without definite mass effect
 on the trachea or enlarged thyroid (correlation was made with CT C-spine from
 ___).  This is likely due to prominent and toruous vessels and has been
 stable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  Bones are slightly
 osteopenic and multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
