                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP 8 AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with right-sided effusion and mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT with contrast ___ at 10:31
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Widening of the mediastinum, particularly the right mediastinal contour is due
 to a large infiltrative mediastinal mass, better assessed on the prior CT
 performed the same day. A right apical mass is also demonstrated. A large
 right pleural effusion with right basilar opacity compatible with atelectasis
 is again seen.  Small left pleural effusion is noted. There is mild prominence
 of the interstitial markings within the left lung which could suggest mild
 volume overload.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess given the presence of the large right pleural effusion.  Numerous
 compression deformities are seen within the imaged thoracolumbar spine, better
 assessed on the CT.  Remote right-sided rib fractures are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large mediastinal mass and right apical mass compatible with malignancy. 
 Large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion with associated
 right basilar atelectasis.  Possible mild fluid overload. Numerous compression
 fractures within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
