                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with abdominal wound infection with fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen and pelvis of the same date, chest radiographs of
 ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which
 accentuate bronchovascular markings.  There is no pleural effusion. 
 Retrocardiac opacities are noted.  There is perihilar vascular congestion. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise unchanged.  Heart is mildly
 enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No focal consolidation.  Sternotomy
 wires are noted, which appear intact.  Aortic valve prosthesis is in place. 
 Gastrojejunostomy and biliary stent projects over mid upper abdomen.
 Malpositioned Dobhoff tube has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Perihilar vascular congestion.  Retrocardiac opacity,
 likely atelectasis, or superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
