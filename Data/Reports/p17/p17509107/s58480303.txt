 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, nasogastric tube replacement.

 of the stomach.  The previously placed Dobbhoff catheter has been removed in
 the interval.  All other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
 position.  The post-surgical clips in the abdomen are better visible than on
 the previous examination.  Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma,
 unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
