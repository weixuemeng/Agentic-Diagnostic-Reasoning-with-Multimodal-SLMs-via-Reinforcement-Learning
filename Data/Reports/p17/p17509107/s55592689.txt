                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  A radiograph was obtained centered at the thoracoabdominal junction
 for assessment of a nasogastric or orogastric tube.  It terminates within the
 distal stomach within the left mid abdomen.  No Dobbhoff tube is detected. 
 Within the imaged portion of the chest, there has not been a substantial
 change since the recent study of several hours earlier.
