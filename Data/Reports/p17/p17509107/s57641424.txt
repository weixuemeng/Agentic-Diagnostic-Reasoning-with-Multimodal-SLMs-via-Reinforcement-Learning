 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:45 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the endotracheal tube, a venous introduction sheath on the
 right, a right Swan-Ganz catheter, a nasogastric tube and drainage devices
 over the liver are all unchanged.  The lung volumes have minimally increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. 
 However, atelectatic areas are still seen at the lung bases, both on the left
 and on the right.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild fluid
 overload.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
