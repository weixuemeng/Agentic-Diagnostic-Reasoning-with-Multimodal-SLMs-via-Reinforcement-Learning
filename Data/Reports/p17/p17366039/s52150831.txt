                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Mid scapular back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There may be a trace pleural effusion on the left side.  The
 left posterior costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded on the lateral view
 making it difficult to exclude a trace pleural effusion.  No fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute disease.
