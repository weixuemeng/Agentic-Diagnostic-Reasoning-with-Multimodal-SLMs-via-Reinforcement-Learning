                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Thrombocytopenia, epigastric bruising.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with
 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle are again noted,
 unchanged.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta remains tortuous. 
 Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries particularly on the right is unchanged,
 compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Diffuse calcified pleural
 plaques are redemonstrated, compatible with the history of asbestos exposure. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  No new focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities. Old bilateral rib fractures and remote trauma to the left
 shoulder are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Bilateral calcified
 pleural plaques suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.  Pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.
