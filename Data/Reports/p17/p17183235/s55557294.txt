                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest CT from ___ as well as a prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, weakness, question CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained demonstrating a
 dual-lead pacer projecting over the left upper chest with lead tips extending
 into the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is
 extensive calcified pleural plaque, which appears grossly stable.  There is no
 definite sign of pneumonia or CHF.  Pleural thickening and/or scarring likely
 accounts for the blunted right CP angle.  Multiple old rib cage deformities
 are again noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes related to prior asbestos exposure with calcified
 pleural plaque.  No definite acute intrathoracic process.
