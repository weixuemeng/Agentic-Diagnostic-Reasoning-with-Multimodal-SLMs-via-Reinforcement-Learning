                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall, evaluate opacity on prior chest x-ray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at ___:___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  Hilar and mediastinal
 contours are otherwise unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of subsegmental
 atelectasis or scarring.  Scarring is also noted in the upper lobes
 bilaterally.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Previously described opacity projecting over the level of the
 undersurface of the aortic arch appears to correlate to a calcified
 mediastinal lymph node.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Previously described focal opacity
 projecting over the undersurface of the aortic arch correlates with a
 calcified mediastinal lymph node, likely the sequela of prior granulomatous
 disease.
