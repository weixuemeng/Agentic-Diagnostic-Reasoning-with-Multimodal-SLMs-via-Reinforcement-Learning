 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is linear scarring at the left lung base and at the lung apices.  On the
 lateral view there is focal opacity projecting over the region of the
 undersurface of the aortic arch not clearly present on prior.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Hypertrophic changes
 are noted in the spine.  There is no visualized displaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 Focal opacity on the lateral view projecting at the level of the undersurface
 of the aortic arch.  While this could be due to overlapping shadows, repeat
