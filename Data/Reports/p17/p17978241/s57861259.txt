                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sudden left-sided weakness with known brain metastases from lung
 carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and reference chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation.
 
 Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.  Multiple mediastinal clips are again
 demonstrated.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again seen.  Left lower lobe
 opacification appears slightly worse when compared to the prior radiograph,
 likely reflecting a combination of patient's known malignancy with atelectasis
 and/or infection superimposed.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 which is increased compared to the prior study.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification within the left lower lobe likely reflecting a
 combination of the patient's known malignancy with atelectasis and/or
 infection superimposed.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
