                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia, evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature, and interstitial thickening consistent with mild volume
 overload.  There is mild bilateral blunting of costophrenic angles consistent
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac silhouette and main
 pulmonary artery segment are markedly enlarged.  There is atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aortic arch.  A right hemodialysis catheter is in place,
 the tip of which projects over the right atrium.  A left chest AICD is in
 place with appropriate positioning of the atrial and ventricular leads.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac opacity projects within the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Airspace opacity in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with diagnosis of
 pulmonary hypertension.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly and interstitial edema consistent with mild congestive heart
 failure.
