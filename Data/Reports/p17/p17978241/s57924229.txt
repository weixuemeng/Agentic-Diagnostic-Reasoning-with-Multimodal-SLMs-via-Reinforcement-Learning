                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, status post fall, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest provided.  AICD is in
 unchanged position with lead tips extending into the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Patient is rotated to her left.  Multiple mediastinal clips are
 noted.  The lungs are clear.  There is a known left lower lobe posterior basal
 mass-like consolidation as seen on prior CT of the chest from ___ and
 ___ which likely accounts for the posterior opacity on the lateral view. 
 A tiny right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  No definite bony abnormality.  A chronic-appearing deformity of the
 right shoulder likely reflects old injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left lower lobe opacity likely reflects known mass lesion
 in this region.  Possible tiny right effusion.
