                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are low lung volumes. 
 There are areas of increased opacification at both bases with silhouetting of
 the hemidiaphragm on the left.  This is consistent with volume loss and
 pleural effusion, more prominent on the left.  No vascular congestion.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the basilar opacification could reflect
 consolidation, especially on the left.
