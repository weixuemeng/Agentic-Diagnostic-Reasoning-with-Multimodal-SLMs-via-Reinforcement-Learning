                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:08
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new oxygen requirement, question
 pneumonia, question aspiration.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:12.
 
 Portable upright chest film, ___ at 10:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart remains enlarged, which
 could reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be
 considered.  There is bilateral airspace disease, which is not significantly
 changed, but would favor pulmonary edema rather than diffuse pneumonia. 
 Retrocardiac area is not well evaluated due to the enlarged heart.  There is
 possibly a left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  A spherical calcification in the
 left upper quadrant again seen and may be splenic in etiology.
