                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // eval for CHF/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Prominence and indistinctness of the hila with
 perihilar alveolar opacities consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. 
 Additional right middle lobe opacity could be due to atelectasis adjacent to
 large hiatal hernia or pneumonia.  There is a large hiatal hernia with
 retrocardiac air-fluid level seen.No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are grossly stable.  Evidence
 of DISH is seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema.  Right middle lobe opacity may be due to atelectasis
 adjacent to large hiatal hernia versus pneumonia.
