                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right-sided chest pain and dyspnea.  Evaluate for edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  Flattening
 of the diaphragms and increased retrosternal clear space suggest underlying
 COPD.  Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged with mild elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are
 stable with moderate cardiomegaly. Mediastinal widening is combination of fat
 and tortuous vessels. Hiatal hernia is again noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema, or effusion.
