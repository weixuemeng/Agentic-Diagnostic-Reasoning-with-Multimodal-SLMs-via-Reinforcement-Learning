                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nausea.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is patchy left basilar opacity, more
 conspicuous on the frontal than on the lateral.  Elsewhere, the lungs are
 clear.  There is no effusion.  Findings suggest small hiatal hernia. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unchanged, noting hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis; however,
 infiltrate from infection is not excluded.  Clinical correlation suggested.
