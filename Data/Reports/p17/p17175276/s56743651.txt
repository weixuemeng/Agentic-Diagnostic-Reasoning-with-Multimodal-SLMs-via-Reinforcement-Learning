 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, no pleural effusion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is better
 visualization of subtle parenchymal opacity in the peripheral and basal zones
 of the right lung.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the change could
 represent early pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema and no larger pleural
 effusion.  Healed rib fractures on the left.  Moderate tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
 edema.
