                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of head and neck cancer, intubated, likely VAP/aspiration
 pneumonia, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.0 cm above the carina.  A PICC line
 is present, tip overlying mid/distal SVC.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared with ___ at 5:30
 a.m.  
 
 There are patchy opacities in both lungs, more pronounced on the left. 
 Compared to the earlier film, there has been some interval improvement on the
 right side, but otherwise, this persists.  Possible small left-
 greater-than-right effusions.  No pneumothorax identified.  A pigtail catheter
 overlies the upper abdomen near the midline.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary opacities, overall similar, but with slight
 improvement at the right base.  The differential diagnosis includes 
 aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and/or  pneumonia.   Small left
 greater than right effusions.
