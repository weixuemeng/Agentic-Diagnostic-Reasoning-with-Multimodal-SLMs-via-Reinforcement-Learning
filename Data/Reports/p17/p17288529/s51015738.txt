                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer with malignant pleural and pericardial
 effusions.  Removal of chest tube, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Subcutaneous gas is seen along the left lower chest and upper
 abdomen wall.  The apparent engorgement of pulmonary vessels on the previous
 study has substantially decreased.
 
 Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.
