                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer, pericardial and pleural fluid, question interval
 change in effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Right IJ central line is present, tip over mid/distal SVC.  
 
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, unchanged.  There is a large left effusion
 tracking along the left chest wall into left lung apex, with underlying
 opacification of the left lung.  The degree of left pleural fluid is similar,
 possibly slightly worse, compared with ___ at 11:42 a.m..  Two-to-three
 catheters overlie the left lung base -- direct correlation with clinical
 history is requested to further characterrize these.  
 
 The right lung is unchanged, grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis or
 scarring in the  mid zone (versus a small amount of minor fissure fluid),
 unchanged.  The right lung base is clear, without gross effusion in the
 costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Large left effusion and opacification of the underlying left lung, with
 some residual aeration in the left upper zone and to a lesser extent left mid
 zone, overall similar to ___ at 11:42 a.m., possibly slightly worse.  
 
 2) Right lung grossly clear.
