                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for dyspnea at ___ hospital, here to evaluate for
 pulmonary edema and ETT position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiographs performed at ___ dated
 ___, ___, ___ and ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just at the level of
 the thoracic inlet 9 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.  There is a focal airspace
 consolidation in the right lung base on this single frontal view, which is
 unchanged from ___ at which time the patient was also intubated but
 new from the pre intubation study of ___.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion and edema is improved from ___.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but
 stable.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The trachea is
 midline.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right basilar consolidation new from pre intubation chest radiograph of ___ raises the possibility of aspiration.  Less likely, this may
 represent asymmetric flash pulmonary edema. 
 
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and edema improved from ___.  
 
 2.  ET tube at thoracic inlet.  NG tube below the diaphragm.
