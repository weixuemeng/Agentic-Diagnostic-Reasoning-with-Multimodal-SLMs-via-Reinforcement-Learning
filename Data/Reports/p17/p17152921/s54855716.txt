 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity within the
 left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in
 the correct clinical setting.  Right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Fusion hardware within the cervical spine is
 incompletely imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot
 be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
