                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with COPD, asbestosis, cough, and chronic left
 scapular pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with CT chest from ___ and chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs.
 The right base pleural plaques are again seen, consistent with patient's
 history of asbestosis.  Calcified nodules in the right mid lung and left
 lateral lower lung are again seen, unchanged from previous exam.  Again seen
 are scattered left mid-zone hazy circular opacities which are more prominent
 on this exam than on previous exams.  They are amorphous and appear to be
 consistent with pleural plaques, but followup CT imaging is recommended to
 evaluate these opacities further.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right lung base pleural plaque and right mid lung and
 left lower lateral lung calcified nodules.  Increased prominence of left
 mid-zone hazy circular opacities.  Recommend followup CT imaging to evaluate
 these opacities further.
 
 These findings were communicated via Radiology Critical Results Dashboard at
 4:35pm.
