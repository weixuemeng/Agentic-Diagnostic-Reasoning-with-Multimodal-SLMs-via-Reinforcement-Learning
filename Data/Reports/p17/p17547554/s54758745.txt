                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, stigmata of fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. Chest CT from ___
 and PET-CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal and unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 knob. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Biapical opacities are again
 noted, with streaky left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis.
 There may be a trace left pleural effusion as there is blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Unchanged biapical pulmonary opacities, which have been previously
 characterized on chest CT from ___ and PET-CT from ___. 
 If clinically indicated, further assessment with a dedicated chest CT can be
 obtained for direct comparison.
 2. Left basilar atelectasis and probable trace left pleural effusion.
