                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Worsening hazy opacification involving the left mid and lower lung fields
 likely reflects an increasing layering pleural effusion which is at least
 moderate to large in size.  There is continued mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Small right pleural effusion persists.  Bibasilar airspace opacities
 may reflect compressive atelectasis.  Ill-defined focal nodular opacities
 within both lung apices are relatively unchanged.  New ill-defined nodular
 opacities within the right upper lung field may reflect superimposed infection
 or aspiration.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increasing layering moderate to large left pleural effusion and unchanged
 small right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.   
 
 2.  New ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lung apex could reflect
 infection or aspiration superimposed on mild to moderate pulmonary edema. 
 
 3. Unchanged biapical nodular opacities.
