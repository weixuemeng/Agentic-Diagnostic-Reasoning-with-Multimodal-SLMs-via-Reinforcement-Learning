                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Heart block with temporary pacer.  Evaluate for interval change and
 location of pacer leads.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates cardiomegaly, pulmonary
 edema, and bilateral pleural effusions with likely associated atelectasis. 
 Given changes in patient position, it is difficult to assess for interval
 change.  No pacer lead is visualized. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No pacer lead is visualized. 
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and likely
 associated atelectasis.  Interval changes are unclear due to changes in
 patient position.
