                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ALS with chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  Some streaky
 bibasilar opacities, slightly worse on the right than the left, are likely
 atelectasis.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac size is at the upper limits
 of normal, and unchanged.  There are coronary artery and aortic valve
 calcifications, which have progressed since the prior exam.  Compression
 deformities in the mid thoracic spine are stable.  Old healed rib fractures
 are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis; no definite evidence of
 pneumonia.
 2.  Hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.
