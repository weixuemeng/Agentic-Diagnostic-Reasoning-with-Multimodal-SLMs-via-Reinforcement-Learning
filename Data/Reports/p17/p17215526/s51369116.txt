                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the outside study of ___, there is little
 overall change.  There are atelectatic streaks especially at the left base,
 but no evidence of appreciable cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Midline sternal wires are intact.  A
 linear opacification at the left base medially most likely represents an
 unchanged surgical clips.
