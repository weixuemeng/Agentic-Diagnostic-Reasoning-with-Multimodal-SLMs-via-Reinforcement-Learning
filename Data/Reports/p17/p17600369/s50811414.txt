                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:49 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypertension and history of aortic aneurysm
 after repair presented with heart failure and volume overload.  Is there
 pulmonary edema or pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The previous severe consolidation in the right lung has not recurred and the
 lower lobe component continues to clear.  Left lower lobe is clearing as well.
 If this was initially pulmonary edema, it has not recurred; however, I would
 reconsider the possibility of chronic severe and recurrent aspiration. 
 Emphysema is reflected in large lung volumes.  Heart is top normal size.
