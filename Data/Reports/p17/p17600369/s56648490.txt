                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent ascending aortic arch repair, now with chest and back
 pain, please evaluate for widened mediastinum or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomediastinal appearance.  Dense retrocardiac
 opacification likely represents a combination of a stable moderate left
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Trace right pleural effusion noted.  Linear
 density within the right middle lung consistent with atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax evident.  Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dense retrocardiac opacification, likely combination of a
 moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Stable small right pleural
 effusion.
