                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and elevated troponins.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___, 9:18 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no change compared to early or same-day study performed at
 ___.  Post-sternotomy cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with
 re-demonstration of increased interstitial markings throughout the right lung
 field with more prominent focal consolidations within the right upper lobe and
 the right middle lobe.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal patchy consolidations of the right lung involving the
 right middle and upper lobe most compatible with multifocal pneumonia. 
 Differential consideration includes asymmetric unilateral pulmonary edema.
