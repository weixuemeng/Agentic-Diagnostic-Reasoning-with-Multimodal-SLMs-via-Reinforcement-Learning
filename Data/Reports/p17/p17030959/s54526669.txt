                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Admitted with trimalleolar fracture of the left ankle, here to
 evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited due to patient rotation.  Within
 this limitation, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are likely within normal limits allowing for rotational changes.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
