                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and wheezing. 
 Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded.  There are no focal opacities in the
 right lung.  The left lung demonstrates stable opacity at the lateral left
 lung base representing post op changes with scarring/atelectasis, stable
 compared to multiple priors. Mild cardiomegaly is again noted. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable otherwise.  There is no
 evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Prominent vascular
 calcifications are noted at the level of the aortic knob.  Fracture deformity
 of the posterolateral left sixth rib. External monitoring devices are present.
 
 IMPRESSION: No significant change compared with prior exam. Left lower lung
 field opacity is stable and represent postoperative changes of
 scarring/atelectasis.
