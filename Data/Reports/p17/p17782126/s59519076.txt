 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of

 right-sided drains and the right medial small pneumothorax. The left
 pneumothorax, manifesting as a bandlike hyperlucency paralleling the vertebral
 bodies on the left is no longer visualized. The nasogastric tube shows an
 overall normal course but its gastric part is coiled and the tip of the tube
 points towards the gastric fundus. The tip is currently located approximately
 2 cm below the left hemidiaphragm.
