                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pre-operative for aortic stenosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Relatively low lung volumes may account for
 the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is
 blunting of the costophrenic angles on the frontal view, but no definite
 effusion is seen on the lateral.  No vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
