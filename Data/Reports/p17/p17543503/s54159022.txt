 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:47 PM
  When compared to the radiograph from ___ at 3:50 AM, there
  continues to be bibasilar opacities, left greater than right. A left chest
  tube is in place, though now pointing inferiorly. An endotracheal tube is in
  place, and a nasogastric tube terminates below the level of the diaphragm, but
  the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. A left
  subclavian central venous line terminates in the lower SVC.

  continues to be bibasilar passes, left greater than right. A left chest tube
  is in place, though now pointing inferiorly. An endotracheal tube is in place,
  and a nasogastric tube terminates below the level of the diaphragm, but the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall from with + EtOH R SDH,  L IPH, SAH  // tachypneic
 - assess for interval change      tachypneic - assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 3:55 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left thoracostomy tube is positioned differently, now oriented inferiorly.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The small volume of left pleural effusion on the
 study ___ has resolved.  Bibasilar consolidation persists, but is
 somewhat improved, presumably resolving pneumonia.  Heart size is normal.
 
 
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements. A presumed shunt
 catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen.  What looks like
 the tip marker of a new intra-aortic balloon pump projecting over the apex of
 the aorta is actually component of an external lead. Esophageal drainage tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.
