                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with question of atelectasis on OSH CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 08:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study.  This accounts for the
 increased size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged.  Crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is present, without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected, however the extreme left costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the field of view.  Multiple clips are seen in the
 right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes compared to the previous radiograph with patchy atelectasis
 in both lung bases.
