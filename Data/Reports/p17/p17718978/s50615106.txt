                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of heart failure, now with chest pain status post AICD
 firing, here to evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left pectoral AICD is unchanged with two leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac silhouette remains severely
 enlarged, compatible with known dilated cardiomyopathy, which is particularly
 impressive on the lateral view.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The lungs are relatively clear without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 but no overt edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
