                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MIE  // R/O PTX post CT removal
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has been removed.
 There is a 8-10 mm right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  The
 postoperative changes, including a small amount of free intra-abdominal air
 under the right hemidiaphragm, are constant. Contrast is seen in the
 neoesophagus.  A small left pleural effusion, causing a small retrocardiac
 atelectasis, persists.
