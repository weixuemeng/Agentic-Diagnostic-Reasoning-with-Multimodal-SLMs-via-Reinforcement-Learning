                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta demonstrates vascular calcifications and mild unfolding.  Diffuse
 interstitial opacities with reticulation are noted, most pronounced at the
 lung bases, suggestive of an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease with
 probable fibrosis.  Additionally, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  No pneumothorax is definitively noted nor is there pleural
 effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse interstitial and reticular opacities predominantly within
 the lung bases, raises the possibility of underlying chronic interstitial lung
 disease, and comparison with any prior studies is recommended.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  A superimposed infectious process within the lung bases
 cannot be excluded.
