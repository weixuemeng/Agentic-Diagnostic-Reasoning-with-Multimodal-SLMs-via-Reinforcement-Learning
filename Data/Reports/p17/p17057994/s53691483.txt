                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV, fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac silhouette size is
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Increased
 interstitial markings bilaterally are noted, with crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, which may suggest atelectasis, mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, or possibly an atypical infectious process. No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 No areas of focal consolidation are present.  There are mild degenerative
 changes within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings most pronounced at the lung
 bases, which are nonspecific and may reflect atelectatic changes but mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, or an atypical infection are not excluded.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.  A repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory
 effort may be helpful for further evaluation.
