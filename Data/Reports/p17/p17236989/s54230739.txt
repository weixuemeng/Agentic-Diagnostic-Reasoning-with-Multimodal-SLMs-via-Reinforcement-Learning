                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with cough.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  In the right cardiophrenic recess
 there is increase in linear opacities which may not be significantly changed
 compared with prior exam.  Retrocardiac opacity and small linear opacity
 abutting the left heart border is noted.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Linear opacities at the lung bases, potentially due to
 atelectasis or scarring but clinical correlation suggested rearding
 possibility of infection.
