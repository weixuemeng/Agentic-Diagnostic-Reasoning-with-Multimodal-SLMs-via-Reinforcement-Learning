                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of the chest tube, there is no definite
 pneumothorax.  The running sutures are again seen with a dense linear
 opacification extending from the lowermost suture to the region of the lateral
 chest wall.  Overall, inspiration is improved.  The right lung is essentially
 clear.
