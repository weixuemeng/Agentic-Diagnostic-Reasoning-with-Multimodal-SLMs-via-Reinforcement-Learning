                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post left upper lobe wedge
 resection, prior history of renal cell carcinoma.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Heart size remains normal.  No
 configurational abnormality identified.  Thoracic aorta unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  The previously described
 postoperative vascular changes and linear densities related to the left upper
 lobe wedge resection again identified.  This shows some regression of scar
 formations but no new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.  Lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses remain free from any pleural effusion and no pneumothorax is
 detectable in the apical areas.  Furthermore, there are no lesions suspicious
 for secondary deposits in this patient with past history of renal cell
 carcinoma.
