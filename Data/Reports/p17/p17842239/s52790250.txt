  Probable large layering bilateral pleural effusions (given supine
  positioning). Underlying consolidation is likely - though uncertain if

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AS, sepsis, acute process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Although not labeled, this film is probably obtained supine.  The cardiac
 silhouette is prominent, but similar to ___.  There is hazy opacity
 diffusely through both lungs -- I suspect the presence of bilateral layering
 effusions.  There is probably underlying collapse and/or consolidation, with
 suggestion of air bronchograms in the right infrahilar region.  
 
 Clinical correlation to confirm that the film was obtained supine is
 recommended as it is difficult to assess the degree of aerated lung on this
 film. If clinically indicated, an upright, lateral and/or decubitus films
 could help to further assess the underlying lung.
