                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Concern for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is mild perihilar fullness bilaterally
 that appear similar to the prior examination.  There are small-to-moderate
 suspected bilateral pleural effusions with a layering effect.  Differences in
 orientation make it difficult to compare directly to the prior examination,
 but these are probably unchanged or perhaps slightly increased.  Patchy right
 lower lobe opacity may be attributable to atelectasis but is not specific.  If
 anything, a retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe has become somewhat
 more dense and could be seen with compressive atelectasis although pneumonia
 cannot be excluded by this examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar opacities that could be
 seen with atelectasis, probably increased and substantial on the left,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Correlation with clinical factors
 suggested.  No overt evidence for congestive heart failure.
