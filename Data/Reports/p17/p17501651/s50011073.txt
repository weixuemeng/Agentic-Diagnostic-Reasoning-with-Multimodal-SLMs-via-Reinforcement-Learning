                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CTA head ___ at 15:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip is within the stomach.  The heart size is normal. Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion with trace left pleural effusion.  Patchy atelectasis is likely
 present in the lung bases.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are present.  Punctate radiopaque densities are seen projecting
 over the left axilla, not seen on the scout view from the previous head CTA.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and trace left pleural effusion.
 3. Punctate radiopaque densities projecting over the left axilla, likely
 external to the patient, as these were not seen on the scout view from the
 previous head CTA.
