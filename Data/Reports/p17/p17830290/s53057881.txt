                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old man with fever and hypotension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Since there are two nodular shadows projecting over the right anterior fifth
 and sixth ribs, both of them cannot be nipple shadows.  In addition, I don't
 see a corresponding shadow to either on the left.  I would recommend a chest
 CT to evaluate presumed lung nodules.  I don't see consolidation, pleural
 effusion or good evidence for central lymph node enlargement.  A
 moderate-sized hiatus hernia developed between ___ and ___.  Lateral view highlights heavy atherosclerotic calcification in the
 proximal great arteries and descending thoracic aorta, as well as a small
 volume of pleural fluid bilaterally.  Dr. ___ was paged at 4:45 p.m. when
 the findings were recognized.
