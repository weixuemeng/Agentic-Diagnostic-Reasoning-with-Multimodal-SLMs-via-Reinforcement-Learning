                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.
 
 STUDY:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 lungs demonstrate a subtle streaky linear-like airspace opacity within the
 anterior segment of the right upper lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine,
 primarily in the form of anterior osteophytes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe airspace opacity, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, compatible with pneumonia or aspiration, although scarring or
 atelectasis are possibilities; follow-up radiography to ensure resolution is
 recommended.
