                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea and hypoxia.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  There are
 hazy opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, likely atelectasis however
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  The cardiac silhouette is
 unchanged.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Left costophrenic angle is
 not included in the field of view.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis from low lung volumes.  However,
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Consider repeat radiographs with lateral view if possible.
