 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen a right-sided central venous catheter with its tip in
 the upper portion of the right atrium.  The patient is slightly rotated to the
 left.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are
 clear, although there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely
 exaggerated by patient positioning.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Opacity of the visualized abdomen suggests ascites.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process; possible ascites.
