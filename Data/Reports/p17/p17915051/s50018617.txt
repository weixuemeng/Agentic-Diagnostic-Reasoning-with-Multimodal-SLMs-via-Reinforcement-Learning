                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of pleural effusion, now
 with dyspnea and crackles on the right.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right CP angle, which could indicate
 effusion/atelectasis.  Overall, findings appear unchanged.  Otherwise, the
 lungs are clear.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Blunting of the right CP angles compatible with effusion with
 probable adjacent atelectasis.
