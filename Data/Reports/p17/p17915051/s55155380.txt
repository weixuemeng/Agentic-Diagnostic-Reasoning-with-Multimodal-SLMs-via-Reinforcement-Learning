                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assess for free air postoperatively.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures.  Patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is compatible with a small right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  No free air is identified under the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No free air under the diaphragms.
 
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
