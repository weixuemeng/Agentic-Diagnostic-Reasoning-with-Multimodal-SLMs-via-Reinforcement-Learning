                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Palpitations and atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  Prominence of the right
 hilum suggests mild prominence of central pulmonary arteries.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous.  There is a slightly prominent pulmonary vascularity but
 without frank edema.  Slight new blunting of the posterior right costophrenic
 sulcus suggests a trace pleural effusion.  Bones appear slightly sclerotic
 although not definitely abnormal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar prominence of central pulmonary vessels without frank
 congestion.  Possibly a trace new pleural effusion on the right.
