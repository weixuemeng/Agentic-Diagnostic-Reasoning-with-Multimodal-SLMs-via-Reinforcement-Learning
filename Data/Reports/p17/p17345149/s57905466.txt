                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with hypoventilation syndrome, hypoxemia, myasthenia
 ___, and PE.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small, larger
 on the right side.  Adjacent bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side,
 are likely atelectasis.  Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Superimposed infection in the right lower lobe cannot be
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
