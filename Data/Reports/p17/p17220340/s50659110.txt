                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever. 
 History of lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Fullness of the right hilum likely
 reflects known lung cancer.  Mild upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution
 suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Coarse interstitial opacities
 are noted in the lung bases which may reflect chronic interstitial
 abnormality.  Additionally, more focal opacity is seen within the periphery of
 the right lung base, a nonspecific finding.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Fullness of the right hilum likely reflects known lung cancer.
 2. Coarse interstitial opacities within the lung bases may reflect chronic
 interstitial lung disease.
 3. More focal opacity periphery of the right lung base is nonspecific and
 could reflect an area of infection or infarction in the correct clinical
 setting.
 4. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
