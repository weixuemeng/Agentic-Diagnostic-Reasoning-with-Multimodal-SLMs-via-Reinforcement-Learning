                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, pulmonary embolus, evolving
 infiltrates  // interval change in right sided infiltrates?      interval
 change in right sided infiltrates?
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe worsening infiltrative pulmonary abnormality most pronounced in the
 right upper lobe.  Heart size is normal but increased since ___
 mediastinal veins are engorged.  There is presumably a component of pulmonary
 edema, but unless the patient has mitral regurgitation to explain the
 predominant edema in the right upper lobe, that abnormality is more likely due
 to concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  An alternative explanation
 for the interstitial abnormality attributed to cardiogenic edema would be
 transfusion or drug reaction.  Small right pleural effusion has increased.
