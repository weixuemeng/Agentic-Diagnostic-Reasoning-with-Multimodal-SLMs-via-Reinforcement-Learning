                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with metastatic cancer these with nausea, vomiting,
 diarrhea, fever  // Please eval for PNA, consolidation, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinum remains widened
 superiorly particularly the right paratracheal stripe compatible with known
 lymphadenopathy.  Fullness of the right hilum is similar compared to the
 previous CT and also likely reflective of underlying lymphadenopathy. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Scattered ill-defined nodular opacities
 bilaterally likely reflect known metastatic disease, but is likely somewhat
 improved compared to the previous CT exam. Curvilinear and patchy bibasilar
 opacities may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse pulmonary metastatic disease appears grossly improved compared to the
 prior CT, with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.
 Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is re- demonstrated.
