                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for pneumothorax.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The pulmonary vessels are more prominent in comparison to the prior study,
 which may represent elevated venous pressures or may be due to a difference in
 technique between the studies.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in either
 lung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion.
