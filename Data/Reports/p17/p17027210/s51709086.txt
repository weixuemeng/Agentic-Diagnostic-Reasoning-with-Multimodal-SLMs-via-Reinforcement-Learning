                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lung
 volumes are increased, but lungs are grossly clear except for a small linear
 area of opacity at the left base, which may reflect localized linear
 atelectasis or scar.  There are no pleural effusions.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized, and note is made of mild scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
