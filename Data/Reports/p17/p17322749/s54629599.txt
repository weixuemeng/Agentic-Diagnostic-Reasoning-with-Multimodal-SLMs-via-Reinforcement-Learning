                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of trauma to back ___
 years ago.  History atypical for chest pain; why does he have chest pain?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  Thoracic aorta is generally widened and moderately
 elongated but no local contour abnormalities are identified.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No evidence of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates is present.  The diaphragms are slightly low positioned and bases
 are somewhat hyperinflated, raising the possibility of COPD.  Again acute
 parenchymal infiltrates, however, cannot be identified.  In the lateral view,
 the lower half of the thoracic spine demonstrates moderate degree of
 osteophytic reactions bridging the anterior contours of three to four
 vertebral bodies in the lower thoracic spine.  There is, however, no
 conclusive evidence of any vertebral body compression fracture.  Observed that
 lumbar spine examination is performed independently from this chest
 examination.  Our records do not include a previous chest examination
 available for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities on chest
 examination.  Mild-to-moderate degree of degenerative changes in the lower
 thoracic spine.  In lower chest some suggestive findings for COPD, but no
 acute infiltrates.
