                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with scleroderma-related ILD, now with AHRF in
 setting of pulm edema/ stress CM, now with acutely worsening hypoxia in
 setting of likely mucus plugging.  // evidence of new airspace disease
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval removal of right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter and ETT and NG tube.  Right IJ
 sheath is noted with tip in the upper SVC.  A left IJ catheter with tip in the
 proximal right atrium.  Decreased bilateral lung volumes post extubation with
 mild increase in bilateral lung densities.  Cardiac size is normal.  Unchanged
 bilateral interstitial markings consistent with patient's known chronic
 pulmonary fibrosis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of new focal opacities or consolidation.  Increased bilateral lung
 densities likely due to decreased lung volumes status post extubation.
