                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with abdominal distention  // evaluate for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  A small left pleural effusion appears
 similar in size compared to the previous chest radiograph.  Associated patchy
 left lower lobe opacity could reflect compressive atelectasis, though
 infection is difficult to exclude.  Minimal atelectasis is noted in the right
 lung base.  No pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged small left pleural effusion.  Patchy left lower lobe opacity may
 reflect compressive atelectasis, however infection is difficult to exclude. 
 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.
