                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sepsis status post left internal jugular
 placement  // evaluate line, pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 06:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid
 SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The remaining lines and tubes remain in
 standard positions.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar.  There is
 continued diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, perhaps minimally
 improved in the interval, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.  More focal
 opacities within the right mid lung field and right lung base again could
 reflect areas of coexistent infection.  Hazy opacity in the right lung base
 likely reflects the presence of a small layering pleural effusion, as seen
 previously.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax.  Slight interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema with
 more focal opacities in the right lung suggestive of coexistent multifocal
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion, probably unchanged.
