                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M h/o recent MI s/p DES to LAD s/p L CFA endarterectomy, L CIA
 stent x2, and L distal EIA stent w/ postop respiratory arrest requiring
 reintubation cardioversion for afib  // assess pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube
 remains low, with tip currently terminating 1.6 cm above the carina.  Slight
 increase in pulmonary edema.  Bilateral layering pleural effusions are
 difficult to compare to the prior study due to positional differences but are
 probably unchanged accounting for this factor.  Associated bibasilar
 atelectasis, most marked in the left retrocardiac region.
