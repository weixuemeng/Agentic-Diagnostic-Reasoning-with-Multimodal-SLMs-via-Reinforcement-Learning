                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal PNA, sepsis  // any e/o volume
 overload?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed.  Left
 IJ central line is unchanged, with tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.
 
 Probable background COPD.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged,
 with mild cardiomegaly.  Mild vascular plethora is probably slightly improved.
 Hazy opacities at the right and left lung bases are themselves improved, but
 the right hemidiaphragm is less distinct, question due to differences in
 positioning.  Faint hazy opacities at right-greater-than-left lung apices
 again noted.  Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to exclude.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal hazy opacities.  These appear slightly more pronounced at the lung
 apices (right-greater-than-left), slightly improved at the left lung base, and
 probably slightly worse at the right lung base.  The differential could
 include changes related to CHF, but multifocal pneumonic infiltrates areas of
 aspiration pneumonitis are also in the differential.
 
 Possibility of small effusions, particularly on the right, cannot be excluded.
 
 The degree of vascular plethora actually appears slightly improved.
