 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobhoff
 tube with its opaque tip in the mid esophagus.  Subsequent study dictated
 previously shows the opaque portion of the tip well within the stomach.
 The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions
 and compressive atelectasis.  Widespread parenchymal opacities bilaterally are
 again noted.
