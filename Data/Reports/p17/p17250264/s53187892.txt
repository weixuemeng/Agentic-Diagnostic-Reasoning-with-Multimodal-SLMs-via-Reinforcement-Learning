                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chest trauma to the left, questionable rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the current chest radiograph, the ribs on the left appear
 intact.  There is no evidence of cortical changes suggestive of fracture.  No
 pneumothorax, no left pleural effusion.  However, a rib series should be
 performed if the suspicion for fractures persists.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.
