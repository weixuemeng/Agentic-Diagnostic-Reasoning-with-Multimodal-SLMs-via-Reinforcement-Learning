                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and effusions. 
 Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed at___ approximately one
 hour prior to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is some vascular upper
 redistribution, and perihilar haziness as well as increased interstitial
 markings suggesting interstitial edema and vascular congestion.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions, right worse than left are seen.  Cardiac size cannot be
 properly assessed due to projection as well as obscuration of the cardiac
 margins by the pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, but there is no
 evidence of cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with acute interstitial pulmonary edema with
 associated bilateral pleural effusions slightly improved compared to recent
 radiograph performed at___ hospital.
