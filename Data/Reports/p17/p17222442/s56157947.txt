  1. Heterogeneous rounded opacity only seen on lateral projection projecting
  over mid thoracic spine is most consistent with loculated effusion. Recommend
  follow-up chest radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for resolution.
  
  2. Stable moderate sized right pleural effusion.
  
  3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.

  1. Heterogeneous rounded opacity only seen on lateral projection projecting
  over mid thoracic spine may represent loculated effusion or rounded
  atelectasis however clinical correlation is recommended to assess for
  pneumonia. Recommend follow-up chest radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for
  resolution.
  
  2. Stable moderate sized right pleural effusion.
  
  3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Assess for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates stable moderate sized right
 pleural effusion.  Heterogeneous rounded opacity only seen on lateral
 projection projecting over the mid thoracic spine is slightly more prominent
 from prior examination.  No additional focal opacity.  No pneumothorax. Stable
 mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Heterogeneous rounded opacity only seen on lateral projection projecting
 over mid thoracic spine is most consistent with loculated effusion. Recommend
 follow-up chest radiograph in 6 weeks to assess for resolution.
 
 2. Stable moderate sized right pleural effusion.
 
 3. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
