 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hip revision, significant blood loss, rule out cardiopulmonary
 process.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 surgery.  The patient is now intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube
 projects 4.5 cm above the carina.
 
 The lung volumes are low, there are bilateral areas of basal atelectasis. 
 There also is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the
 presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.
