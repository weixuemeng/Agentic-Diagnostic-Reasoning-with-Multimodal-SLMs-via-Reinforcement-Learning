                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with lung cancer, effusion pleurex placed  // f/u
 effusion, infiltrate      f/u effusion, infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube remains in
 place and there is little change in the small loculated hydro pneumothorax
 along the upper lateral chest wall.  Persistent opacification is again seen
 consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis with underlying malignancy in
 the left hemithorax.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
 The right lung is clear.
