 INDICATION:  Reassess right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  08:52 hours.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate right pneumothorax is little changed at the apex, again extending the
 fifth posterior rib, however, there is increased air seen laterally at the
 right lung base.  Additionally, previously present though retrospectively
 increased in conspicuity is a coexistent small-moderate left pneumothorax,
 seen at the apex, medially, and at the left base.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions persist, less conspicuous likely due to
 positioning.  There is no new parenchymal opacity.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral pneumothoraces, moderate on the
 right and small to moderate on the left.
