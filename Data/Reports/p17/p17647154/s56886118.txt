                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post aortic valve replacement
 with pneumothorax after chest tube removal.  Assess pneumothorax for
 expansion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day.  During the
 examination interval the previously remaining right internal jugular approach
 sheath has been removed.  The right-sided moderately sized pneumothorax in the
 apical area remains rather unchanged.  Also the left sided very small apical
 pneumothorax separation can again be identified and also appears unchanged. 
 No other significant interval changes are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral apical pneumothoraces, very small on left
 side, moderate sized on right.
