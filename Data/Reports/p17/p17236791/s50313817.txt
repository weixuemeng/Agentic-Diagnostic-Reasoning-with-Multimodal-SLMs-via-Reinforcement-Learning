                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fall concern for syncope.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature.  Heterogeneous left
 lower lobe opacity only seen on frontal projection.  Blunting of the left
 lateral costophrenic angle is due to scarring.  There is no effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The heart is top-normal in size, likely accentuated due to low
 lung volumes.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are notable for mild anterior
 wedging of mid thoracic vertebral body, better assessed on ___ CT
 torso.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 2. No pneumonia.
 3. Mild anterior wedging of mid thoracic vertebral bodies better assessed on ___ CT torso.
