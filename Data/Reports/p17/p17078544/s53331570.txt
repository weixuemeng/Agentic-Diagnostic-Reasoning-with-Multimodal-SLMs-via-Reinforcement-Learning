 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:07 PM
  Slight improved aeration of the left upper lung.  Right lung opacification
  persists - likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Unchanged moderate bilateral
  pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged and are likely due to
  compressive atelectasis.  Assessment for new area of aspiration very difficult
  given the significant underlying abnormalities.  No pneumothorax.  Unchanged
  moderate cardiomegaly - difficult to assess due to basilar opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:32 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  CHF and witnessed aspirations, question new infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous severe pulmonary edema has improved, but there is still a large right
 pleural effusion and possibility of pneumonia in both lower lobes and in the
 axillary region of the right upper lobe all of which, alternatively could be
 due to residual edema, atelectasis and overlying effusion.  If feasible,
 conventional radiographs might be easier to interpret.  Moderate enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette is longstanding.  There is no mediastinal vascular
 engorgement to suggest that there is associated elevation of central venous
 pressure.  No pneumothorax.
