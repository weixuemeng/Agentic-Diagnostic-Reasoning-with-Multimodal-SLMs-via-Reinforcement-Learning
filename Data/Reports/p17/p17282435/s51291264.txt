                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:34
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pericardial effusion, question edema,
 question atelectasis.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to assess for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart markedly enlarged which would be consistent with a known pericardial
 effusion, although underlying cardiomegaly could also give this appearance. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is possibly a small layering
 left effusion.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity could reflect areas of
 atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Comparison to prior studies would be helpful to
 assess for interval change in the cardiac silhouette.
