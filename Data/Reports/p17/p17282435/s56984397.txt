                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with myopericarditis, question change in
 cardiac silhouette.  
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 434.
 
 Portable erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall, the heart remains markedly enlarged, which may represent a
 pericardial effusion and/or cardiomegaly.  There now is some lucency
 surrounding the left apex which could reflect some air within the pericardium
 or possibly reflects improved aeration at the left lung base.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Persistent retrocardiac consolidation in the setting
 of a layering effusion is suggestive of atelectasis, although aspiration or
 pneumonia should also be considered.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Vasculature is cephalized suggestive of pulmonary venous
 hypertension.  Lung volumes remain low.  Interval appearance of some patchy
 opacities at the right base likely reflects atelectasis.
