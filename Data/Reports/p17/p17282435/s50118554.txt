 within the pericardium.  Overall, there is improved aeration at the left base
 with residual partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of an effusion.  A
 small right effusion is also likely.  There is resolving atelectasis at the
 right base as well.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  The pericardial
 catheter is now visualized on the lateral projection.  Mild degenerative
 changes in the visualized thoracolumbar spine.
