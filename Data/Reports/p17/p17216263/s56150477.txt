  There are likely layering pleural effusions bilaterally.  A right PICC
  terminates in the cavoatrial junction.  Dobhoff tube in gastric body.  Areas
  of patchy opacity are noted in the right mid lung but less conspicuous
  compared to the prior study.  Cardiomegaly is stable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with elevated WBC and low grade temp  // ?
 pneumonia vs pleural effusion ? compare to prior study Surg: ___ (peg)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a right PICC has been advanced
 or replaced, now terminating at or just below the cavoatrial junction.  Low
 lung volumes accentuate cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. 
 Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and both lower lungs show interval
 improvement, possibly due to a resolving pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.
