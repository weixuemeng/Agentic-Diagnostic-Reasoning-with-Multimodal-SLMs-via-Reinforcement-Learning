                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:33.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, terminating
 approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen,
 coursing below the level off the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen.  There
 is persistent prominence of the left hilum.  Left mid to lower lung patchy
 opacities are less confluent, although this difference may relate to changes
 in patient positioning and inspiration; however, remain concerning for
 infection and/or aspiration.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Left base
 atelectasis/scarring seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position, terminating approximately 4 cm
 above the level of carina. Interval placement of nasogastric tube, coursing
 below the level of diaphragm, off the inferior aspect of the image.  Side port
 at the proximal level of the GE junction, suggests advancement so that it is
 well within the stomach.
 2.  Patchy left mid-to-lower lung opacities may be due to infection and/or
 aspiration.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Continued prominence of the
 left hilum, stable.
