                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was obtained.  Per the radiology
 technologist, the patient unable to remain still, since the patient is
 hypoxic, unable to follow directions.  The patient is rotated to the right. 
 Prominence of the left hilum is relatively stable.  However, there is
 increased patchy opacity involving left mid to lower lung which may be due to
 infection or aspiration, less likely asymmetric edema.  Slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle could be due to a trace pleural effusion.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to patient positioning.  Interval
 development of left mid to lower lung patchy opacity may relate to infection
 or aspiration versus asymmetric edema.  Trace blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, trace pleural effusion not excluded.  Consider PA and
 lateral views when/if patient able with better positioning.
