                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with lung cancer, worsening hypoxia  // presence of
 pleural effusion, infiltrate, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently of the same day at 742 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Near complete opacification of the left hemothorax has developed since the
 radiograph 1.5 hr prior with increased leftward shift of the mediastinal
 structures, consistent with lung collapse. At least a small to moderate sized
 left pleural effusion is present. An intrabronchial mass is seen in the distal
 left mainstem bronchus with a fiducial marker. The right lung appears clear.
 No pneumothorax is identified in either lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of left lung near-complete, likely related to distal left
 mainstem intrabronchial mass. Left pleural effusion, at least small to
 moderate in size.
