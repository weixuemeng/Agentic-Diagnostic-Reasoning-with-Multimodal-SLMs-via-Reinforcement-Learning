                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic lung CA and L mainstem bronchus
 endobronchial mass leading to total obstruction of L lung; now intubated in R
 mainstem bronchus for airway protection  // verify position of ET tube in R
 mainstem bronchus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 11:01
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, the endotracheal
 tube has been advanced and now terminates at the proximal right mainstem
 bronchus. There is now complete opacification of the left hemithorax. This
 appears slightly worse compared to the prior radiograph from this morning due
 to loss of the minimal left lung aeration that was present on the prior CXR. 
 Right lung is essentially clear, with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac silhouette is obscured.
 
 Enteric tube terminates in the stomach.  Fiducial marker adjacent to the left
 mainstem bronchus is re-demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. The endotracheal tube has been advanced and now terminates at the proximal
 right mainstem bronchus.
 2.  Complete opacification of left hemithorax due to large pleural effusion
 and collapse.
