                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of shortness of breath,
 CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  AICD is
 again seen, with leads unchanged in position.  There are bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right with overlying atelectasis.  There is also
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The hila are prominent, suggestive of
 pulmonary vascular engorgement.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to accurately
 assess but may be enlarged since the prior study.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with
 bibasilar atelectasis in combination with pulmonary vascular congestion
 suggests CHF.
