 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD#1 from small bowel resection and revision of
 ileocolic anastomosis now with fever  // r/o pulm. etiology
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A linear opaque structure projects over the left hemi thorax.  There is linear
 lateral left base atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation is seen. 
 There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
