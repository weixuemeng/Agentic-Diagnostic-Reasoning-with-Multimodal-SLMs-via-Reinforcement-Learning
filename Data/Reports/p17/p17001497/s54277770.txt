                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Coarse breath sounds.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 allowing for differences in technique.  There is an opacity in the left lower
 lung obscuring the cardiac border and left hemidiaphragm with persistent mild
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Findings are non=specific and could be
 seen with atelectasis or consolidative pneumonia.  Interstitial prominence in
 the upper zones may be due to coinciding mild congestion, but with little if
 any change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity which is non-specific as to etiology. 
 Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion associated with a persistent mild
 interstitial abnormality.
