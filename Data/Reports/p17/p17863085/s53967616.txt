                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Rounded densities
 measuring up to 1.7 centimeters are seen projecting over the right scapular
 region, which could reflect sclerotic lesions within the scapula, or possibly
 soft tissue calcifications.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 
 
 2. Rounded densities are seen projecting over the right scapular region, which
 could reflect sclerotic lesions within the scapula, or possibly soft tissue
 calcifications.  This could be further assessed with dedicated right shoulder
 radiographs if clinically indicated.
