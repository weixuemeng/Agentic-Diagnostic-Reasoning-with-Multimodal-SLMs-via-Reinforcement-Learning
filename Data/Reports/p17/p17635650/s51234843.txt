                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions, progressed since prior
 exam.  There is an area of increased retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect
 atelectasis vs. possible superimposed infection.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  Sternotomy wires and a mechanical aortic valve are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 2.  Retrocardiac opacity, possibly representing atelectasis but recommend
 clinical correlation for possible superimposed infection.
