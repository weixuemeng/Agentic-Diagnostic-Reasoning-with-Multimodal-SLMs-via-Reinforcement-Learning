                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob  // post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates
 in the region of the stomach and could be advanced 4-5 cm.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged on this AP view.  There is pulmonary vascular
 engorgement with moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural
 effusion. There is a moderate to large left pleural effusion with a more focal
 opacity at the base of the left lung which likely reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe pulmonary edema with a moderate to large RIGHT pleural
 effusion.  Focal opacity at the left lung base is probably a combination of
 atelectasis and small to moderate left pleural effusion.
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina.
