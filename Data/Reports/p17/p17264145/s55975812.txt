                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM  A right-sided PICC is seen which courses towards the cavoatrial
 junction, however the tip is obscured by overlying pacemaker leads.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PPM revision  // eval PPM placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, permanent pacemaker remains in
 place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. Persistent
 cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and improving
 interstitial edema.  Hazy right upper lobe opacity is again demonstrated, and
 may reflect asymmetrical edema or secondary process such as infectious
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
