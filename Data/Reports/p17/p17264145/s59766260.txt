                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pacemaker lead revision  // Evaluate for
 lead placement or pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis.  A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, a
 right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal contour is
 unchanged.  Calcific densities projecting over the right apex are likely due
 to apical pleural scarring.  No pneumothorax seen.  Atrophic remodeling of the
 bilateral proximal humeri is likely related to the superior subluxation of the
 glenohumeral joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No pneumothorax seen.
