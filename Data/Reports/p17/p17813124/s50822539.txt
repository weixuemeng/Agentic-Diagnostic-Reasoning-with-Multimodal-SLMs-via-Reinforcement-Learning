                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with diffuse wheeze, crackles on lung exam
 
 COMPARISON:  No priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There is near complete
 opacification of the left hemi thorax with volume loss and residual bubbly
 lucency in the mid to upper lung.  There is significant leftward shift of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Within the right lung there are scattered
 nodular and ill-defined opacities potentially concerning for pneumonia. 
 Difficult to exclude a left pleural effusion.  No large right effusion.  No
 large pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward shift of
 midline structures.  Scattered opacities in the right lung, question
 pneumonia.  CT is needed to further assess as malignancy is difficult to
 exclude.
