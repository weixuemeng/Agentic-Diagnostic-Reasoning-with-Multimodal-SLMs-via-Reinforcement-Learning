                                 FINAL REPORT
    EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with history TB meningitis admitted for HCAP
 now with sudden onset of tachypnea to ___  // increase in pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or aspiration     increase in pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or aspiration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change.  Monitoring
 and support devices are stable, as is the heterogeneous and calcified right
 lower lobe opacity consistent with a pleural based mass that has been stable
 for at least ___ years.
 The cardiac silhouette is more prominent and there is increased opacification
 at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm.  This suggests
 some pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is again seen.
 It is difficult to assess the pulmonary vessels, though there may be mild
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
