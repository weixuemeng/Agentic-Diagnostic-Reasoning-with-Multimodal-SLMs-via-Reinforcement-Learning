                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  An endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above
 the carina.  An upper enteric tube ends in the stomach.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Bilateral patchy airspace opacities are most
 predominant in the lower lobes.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina.  Bilateral
 heterogenous airspace opacification, predominantly in the lower lobes is
 concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome or hemorrhage with
 concurrent septic emboli or pneumonia.
