                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated with ARDS  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ AT 18:25
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have not changed appreciably, but generalized pulmonary
 opacification has worsened. Given the rapidity, if positive pressure
 ventilation was not altered, the change is due to volume dependent or cardiac
 related pulmonary edema. However since heart size and mediastinal venous
 caliber are normal, the change could be due entirely to a decrease in positive
 pressure ventilator support.
 
 Lines and tubes in standard placements. Pleural effusions are presumed, but
 not large, and there is no pneumothorax.
