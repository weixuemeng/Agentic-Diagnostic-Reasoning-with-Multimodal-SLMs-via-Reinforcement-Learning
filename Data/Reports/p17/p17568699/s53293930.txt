                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ards  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 12:11.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsened and generalized opacification reflects, in part, tracheal extubation,
 but probably increasing pulmonary edema as well, superimposed on the
 multifocal infection and non cardiac edema in the lungs.
 
 Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. Heart is normal size. 
 Esophageal tube ends in the upper portion of the nondistended stomach and
 would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.
 Left internal jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
