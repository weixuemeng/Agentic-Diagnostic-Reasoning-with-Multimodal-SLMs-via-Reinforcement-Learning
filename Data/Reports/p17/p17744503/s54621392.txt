                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of stage IV
 lung cancer, admitted for shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 No prior studies are available for comparison.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed.
 
 The radiograph demonstrates right hilar mass with subsequent atelectasis of
 the right lower lobe and part of the right middle lobe.  There is most likely
 present right pleural effusion.  The rest of the lungs are clear, and it is
 hard to say if there is an infectious process within the collapsed lung
 adjacent to the hilar mass or it is only atelectasis.  Comparison with prior
 studies is essential.  No left pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 noted.
