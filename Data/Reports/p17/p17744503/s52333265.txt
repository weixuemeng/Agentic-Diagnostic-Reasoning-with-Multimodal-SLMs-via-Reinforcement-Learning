                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with metastatic lung cancer and worsening
 hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in
 an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists, likely related to
 adjacent rib metastasis.  Prominent hila bilaterally likely reflect known
 hilar adenopathy.  No focal consolidation, right pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  Left retrocardiac opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for acute process.
