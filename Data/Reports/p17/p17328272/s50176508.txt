                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of cough and dyspnea, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided PICC which terminates in the mid SVC.  The
 heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  Note is
 made of subtle increase in consolidation at the left retrocardiac lung base. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in consolidation at the left lung base, which
 could be secondary to an atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process
 cannot be excluded.
