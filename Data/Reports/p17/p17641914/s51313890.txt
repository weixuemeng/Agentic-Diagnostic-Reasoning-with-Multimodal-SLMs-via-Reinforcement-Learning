                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is top normal.  The
 lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Moderate
 bibasilar atelectasis is present, with a left retrocardiac opacity which may
 reflect atelectasis versus small consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis.  Infection in this region
 cannot be excluded.
