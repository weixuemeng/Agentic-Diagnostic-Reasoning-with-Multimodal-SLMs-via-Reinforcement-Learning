                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:    ___F with prior ACS hx with 1 day resolved CP. WBC ___, troponin
 negative  // eval ? infiltrate, cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___, ___, chest
 CT with contrast dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but stable since the prior examination. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is similar to the most recent comparison examination
 as well.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A large mass in the
 left upper lobe is slightly increased in size since ___, and remains
 concerning for primary malignancy.  Other nodular opacity is see on prior CT
 are not well depicted, though there is suggestion of a nodular opacity in the
 right mid lung which had been present on prior CT as well.  No definite focal
 consolidation is identified.  Linear opacity in the right base is most
 consistent with atelectasis, and is largely similar to the most recent
 examination.
 
 Vertebral body height loss in the mid thoracic spine is similar to the prior
 examination.  A sclerotic focus in the mid thoracic spine was also present on
 the prior examination and is compatible with overlying osteophyte formation. 
 Cervical fixation hardware is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia.  Increase in size of left upper lobe mass
