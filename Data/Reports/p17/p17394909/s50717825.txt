                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated.  The heart size is normal.  The thoracic aorta is
 diffusely calcified but not dilated.  New ill-defined opacity within the left
 upper lung field is concerning for pneumonia.  Minimal linear and patchy
 opacity in the right lung base may reflect scarring.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with S-shaped scoliosis
 of the thoracolumbar spine.  Partially imaged is cervical spinal fusion
 hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacity in the left upper lung field may reflect an area of pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure resolution of
 this finding.
