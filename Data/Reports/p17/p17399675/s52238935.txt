                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of pneumonia with increased right chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  Linear and patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis, similar to the prior exam.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified.  Mild
 biapical pleural thickening is present.  Clips are seen in the right upper
 quadrant of the abdomen compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis, relatively unchanged compared to the prior study.
