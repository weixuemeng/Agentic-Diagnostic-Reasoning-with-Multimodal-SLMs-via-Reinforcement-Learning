                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma and hemoptysis and
 consolidation on prior chest radiographs.  Assess for parapneumonic pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Atelectasis persists, though improved in both the left base and in the right
 middle lobe.  There is no pulmonary edema or any new lung findings to suggest
 infection.  As noted previously, diagnosis of pulmonary embolus needs to be
 considered in the setting of the recent history of chest pain, hemoptysis and
 radiographic findings of atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion or other indirect evidence of cardiac
 decompensation.
