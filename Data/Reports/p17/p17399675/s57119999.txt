                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with multiple myeloma after auto bone marrow
 transplant.  Now with pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:  
 
 Over the past four days, substantial bibasilar consolidation and some
 atelectasis has developed in both lower lobes and particularly the right
 middle lobe.  When the chest CT was performed ___, these abnormalities had
 not yet developed.  In terms of localizing the source of hemoptysis, I would
 recommend a CTA to look both for pulmonary emboli and infarction and
 endobronchial clot.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  Pleural
 effusion is small on the right, not appreciable if at all on the left.  Heart
 size is top normal, unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
