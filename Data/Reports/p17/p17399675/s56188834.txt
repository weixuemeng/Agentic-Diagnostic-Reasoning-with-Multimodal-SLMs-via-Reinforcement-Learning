 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma and cough, shortness of breath, rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Large bilateral symmetrical hilar structures are likely caused by a
 slight pectus.  They are unchanged as compared to previous image.  There
 currently is no evidence of parenchymal opacities, in particular no evidence
 of pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or
 masses.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.
