                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for fluid overload or mediastinal widening.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 are new patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, streaky in nature and
 probably due to minor atelectasis, although not completely specific.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  Minimal biapical
 pleural thickening is noted, unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe patchy opacities typical for minor atelectasis;
 it is hard to completely exclude early pneumonia, particularly in the
 appropriate setting, although less likely.  Correlation with physical exam
 recommended as well as other clinical factors; if there is clinical concern
 for the possibility of developing pneumonia, then short-term follow-up
 radiographs may be of potential value. 
 
 Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 at 9:32 a.m. via telephone on the day of the study.  Dr. ___ ___ the
 final report with Dr. ___ at 4:15 pm by telephone.
