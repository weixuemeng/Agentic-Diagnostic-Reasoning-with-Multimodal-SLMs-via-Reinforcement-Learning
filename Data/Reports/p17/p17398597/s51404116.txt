                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HFrEF, swan in R IJ  // Confirm swan in
 place
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 22:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided 2 lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium
 and right ventricle.  A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, with tip 
 distal, over lying an inferior branch of right pulmonary artery.  Clinical
 correlation regarding retraction is requested.  There is a right-sided PICC
 line.  The tip is not well delineated, but is likely unchanged, lying at the
 level of the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, similar to the prior study. 
 Again seen is borderline upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. 
 Minimal hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is similar to prior. 
 There may be minimal left lower lobe atelectasis, but no dense retrocardiac
 density.  No other focal opacities are identified.  No gross effusion.
 
 Again noted are multiple somewhat coiled wire like sutures overlying the right
 lateral lower chest and upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, unchanged.No overt CHF.
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis again noted.
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip is relatively distal, superimposed over lower right
 pulmonary artery.  Clinical correlation regarding possible retraction is
 requested.
