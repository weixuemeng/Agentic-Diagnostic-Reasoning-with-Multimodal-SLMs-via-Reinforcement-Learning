 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p CABG w/sub-q air and
 hypoxia r/o PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest

 consolidation along the right lung base and hyperlucency of the right upper
 lobe consistent with right lower lobe collapse.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacity at the left lung base consistent with increased atelectasis. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema extending from the neck to the lateral chest
 bilaterally is slightly improved compared to prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
