                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___F with hypoxia shortness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings seen throughout the lungs, potentially due to
 lower lung volumes although superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion is
 suspected.  More confluent basilar opacity suggests bilateral pleural
 effusions larger on the left and more dense consolidation at the lung bases
 are potentially atelectasis noting that infection or aspiration are also
 possible.  Cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar opacities likely in part due to
 pleural effusions although atelectasis and/or infection are entirely possible.
