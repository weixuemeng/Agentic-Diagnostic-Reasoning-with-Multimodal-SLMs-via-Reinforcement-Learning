                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with relative flattening of the
 diaphragms, which may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The
 patient is rotated to the right.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. 
 Stable density along the cardiac silhouette may relate to overlying soft
 tissue versus possible enlarged left atrium.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There is minimal prominence of
 interstitial markings, which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  The
 bones are osteopenic.
