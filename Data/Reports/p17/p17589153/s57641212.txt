                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, PNA, w/ respiratory distress  //
 volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously seen 1.5 cm right upper
 lobe nodule is less well visualized. However, the indication for CT persists.
 The linea opacities, predominantly interstitial in structure, and mainly
 located in the lung bases are not substantially changed. As noted in the
 previous report, these opacities are likely reflecting pneumonia.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and elongation of the descending aorta are not substantially
 changed.  No new opacities.
