                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:59 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with aortic stenosis and CHF.  Now intubated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved since ___, including the most recent
 chest radiograph at 9:01 p.m.  There is greater opacification in the left
 suprahilar upper lobe than anywhere and while this may be asymmetric edema and
 should be monitored to exclude concurrent pneumonia, particularly aspiration. 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Right internal jugular line ends close to
 the superior cavoatrial junction.  Greater opacification at the lung bases is
 probably a combination of mild dependent edema, atelectasis and pleural
 effusions collected posteriorly, even though small.  No pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has improved slightly since its worst on ___.
 
 There is a suggestion of a tiny left apical pneumothorax which led me to
 question if there had been an attempted line placement from the left side
 prior to the right.
 
 The resident physician caring for this patient and I discussed these findings
 by telephone 2 minutes after the recognition.
