                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient, intubated, follow up tiny left apical
 pneumothorax.  Evaluate for interval change of pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable
 chest examination obtained six and a half hours earlier during the same day. 
 Status post sternotomy, marked cardiac enlargement and aortic valve
 replacement (metallic structures of porcine valve) unchanged.  Pulmonary
 congestive pattern encountered earlier during the day has regressed slightly. 
 Patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Previously suspected
 small left apical pneumothorax cannot be identified with certainty now on
 portable film and a special high contrast copy.
 
 No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant pneumothorax remaining.  No new pulmonary
 abnormalities.  Slight regression of pulmonary congestion.
