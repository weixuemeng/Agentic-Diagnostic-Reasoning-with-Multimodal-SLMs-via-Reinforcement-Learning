 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 valve replacement.  The sternotomy wires are in unchanged position.  The
 patient has a Swan-Ganz catheter in correct position.  The radiograph shows
 moderate fluid overload and mild interstitial edema.  The heart continues to
 be moderately enlarged.  However, no pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Mild overinflation of the stomach, potentially amenable to improvement
 by nasogastric tube placement.
