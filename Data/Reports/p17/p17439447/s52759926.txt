                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DLBCL now with worsening hypoxia  // r/o
 pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours and result in
 bilateral bronchovascular crowding, limiting assessment of the cardiovascular
 status of the patient.  Despite this limitation, the presence of peripheral
 interstitial opacities suggests the possibility of interstitial edema.
 Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, aspiration and less likely
 infectious pneumonia. Consider followup PA and lateral chest radiographs with
 improved inspiratory level for initial further assessment of these findings.
