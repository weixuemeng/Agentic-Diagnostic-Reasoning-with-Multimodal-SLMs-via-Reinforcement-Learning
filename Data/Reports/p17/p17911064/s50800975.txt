                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea status post fall.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. 
 There is increased haziness in the right lung with opacities in the right
 greater than left base, appearance suggestive of asymmetric edema, versus
 aspiration or infection.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Post-operative changes of CABG and median
 sternotomy appear unremarkable.  Moderate right greater than left shoulder
 degenerative disease is present.  No definite displaced osseous injury is
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased hazy opacity in the right lung, predominantly in the
 right greater than left base, which could represent asymmetric edema versus
 aspiration or infection.  No pneumothorax.  No laboratory data is available at
 the time of interpretation, which should be correlated as well as with
 clinical presentation.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 10:50 am via phone on ___.
