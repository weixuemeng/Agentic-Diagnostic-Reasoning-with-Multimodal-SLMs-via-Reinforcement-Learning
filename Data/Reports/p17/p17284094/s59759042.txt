                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again noted are prominent interstitial markings with indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature, minimally increased in comparison to the prior study. 
 There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The right
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  The aorta is tortuous and has calcifications
 at the arch.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild increase in prominence of central markings with indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature along with moderate cardiomegaly, and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  These findings are likely representative of pulmonary
 edema with possible heart failure.
