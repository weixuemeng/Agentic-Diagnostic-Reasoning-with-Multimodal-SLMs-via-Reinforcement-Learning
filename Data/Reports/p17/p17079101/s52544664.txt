                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Mechanical fall, chest abrasions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same date, ___ at 08:16 as well as ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lateral
 views are suboptimal due to patient positioning and underpenetration.  It is
 difficult to exclude bilateral pleural effusions.  Low lung volumes persist on
 the frontal view, with elevated right hemidiaphragm.  There is prominence of
 the interstitium, suggesting interstitial edema.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  Surgical clips project over the right aspect of the
 mediastinum.
