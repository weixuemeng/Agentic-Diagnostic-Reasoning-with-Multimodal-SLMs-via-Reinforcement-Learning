                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and lung cancer status post resection admitted
 after mechanical fall, now with worsening respiratory distress, here to
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 14:57.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes remain low.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is unchanged, compatible with prior right lung resection.  There
 is improved aeration of the left lung base without blunting of the
 costophrenic angle to suggest pleural effusion.  There is increased
 opacification of the right lung, predominantly affecting the lower lung zone,
 which silhouettes the right hemidiaphragm and the right heart border.  There
 is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 remains prominently enlarged but stable compared to the remote prior study of
 ___.  Surgical clips are noted projecting over the right upper mediastinum. 
 Hypertrophic degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right lung, likely a combination
 of pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  Given the mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion, this may represent fluid overload but given the recent
 history of trauma, injury is not excluded.  If there is clinical concern for
 trauma, a non-contrast chest CT would be recommended for further evaluation.
