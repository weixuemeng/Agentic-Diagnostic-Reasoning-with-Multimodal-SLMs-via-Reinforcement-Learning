                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and non-small cell lung cancer status post
 resection, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 05:52.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is improved
 aeration at the right lung base with improved definition of the right
 hemidiaphragm and right heart border suggesting decreased atelectasis and
 pleural fluid.  The left lung remains clear without pleural effusion or focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax is present.  The right hemidiaphragm remains
 elevated compatible with prior right lung resection.  There is decreased but
 persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains prominently enlarged but stable.  Surgical clips project to
 the right of the trachea, compatible with prior lung resection.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration of the right lung base compatible with decreased
 atelectasis and pleural fluid.
 2.  Improved but persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3.  Stable appearance status post right partial lung resection.
