                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Ill-defined hazy opacity is
 seen within the right middle lung field, likely within the right upper lobe,
 concerning for infection.  Left lung is clear. Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle on the frontal view may be due to trace pleural fluid or
 pleural thickening. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity within the right upper lobe is concerning for an area of
 infection. Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
 resolution of this finding.
