                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever and reported cough
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam is dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   There has been interval
 placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the low SVC
 region.  There is a tiny right pleural effusion.  Subtle ground-glass opacity
 in the left lateral lung base is new from prior and may represent a very early
 pneumonia.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tiny right pleural effusion and subtle opacity in the right lateral lung base
 concerning for pneumonia.
