 evidence for pulmonary infiltrate. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Pulmonary vasculature is mildly congested.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits with calcified tortuous aorta again noted. 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in similar position given differences in technique.

 vascular congestion without definitive evidence for consolidation.
