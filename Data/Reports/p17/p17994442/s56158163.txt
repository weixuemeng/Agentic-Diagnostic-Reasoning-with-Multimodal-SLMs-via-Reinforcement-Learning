 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with shortness of breath and
 ___-pack-year smoking history.  Evaluate for infiltrates.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  PA and lateral chest views were obtained
 with patient in upright position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of
 normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified. 
 Thoracic aorta of ordinary ___, however, some calcium deposits are seen
 in the aortic wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are
 free.  No pneumothorax in apical area on frontal view.  Mild degree of
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine, which demonstrates a
 mildly accentuated kyphotic curvature, but absence of any significant
 vertebral body compression deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  No evidence of acute infiltrates, pleural
 effusions, or pneumothorax.  No malignancy, suspicious abnormalities
 identified on standard PA and lateral chest views.
