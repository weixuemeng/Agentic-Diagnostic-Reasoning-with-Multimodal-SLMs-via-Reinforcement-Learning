 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right diaphragmatic plication surgery, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  A minimal pleural effusion
 is seen laterally in the region of the right costophrenic sinus, combined to
 areas of plate-like atelectasis.  On the left, costophrenic sinus is
 unremarkable and the lung base is normal.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.  No other lung parenchymal pathology.
