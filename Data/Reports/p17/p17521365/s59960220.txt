 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube and NG tube are in similar position compared to prior.  Low lung
 volumes are minimally improved, again causing some accentuation of the cardiac
 silhouette and causing bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  Pleural effusions
 are small if any. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interval improvement since prior. Mild streaky bibasilar atelectasis.
