                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT tube, likely developing pneumonia  //
 ETT tube interval change; pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip is in the mid thoracic trachea.  Enteric tube tip is in the
 stomach with the side port near the GE junction.  Low lung volumes again cause
 accentuation of the cardiac silhouette as well as bronchovascular crowding. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and right basilar atelectasis are mild, similar
 to prior.  Retrocardiac opacity appears minimally worse compared to prior. 
 Pleural effusions are small if any.  There is no pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip is in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. Retrocardiac opacity appears minimally worse compared to prior, but this
 may be due to differences in patient position.  There could be a component of
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
