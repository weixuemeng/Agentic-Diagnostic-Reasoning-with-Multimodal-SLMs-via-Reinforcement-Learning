                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with asbestosis, last chest x-ray dated
 ___.  Followup examination to evaluate for any new lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size is within normal limits. 
 There are prominent fat pads both in the cardiac apical area as well as the
 right-sided cardiophrenic angle.  These findings are unchanged.  The thoracic
 aorta is mildly widened and elongated but no local contour abnormalities or
 walled calcifications are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present
 and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax in the apical area on the frontal view.  Specifically, with
 regard to the asbestos exposure history, there is no evidence of pleural
 plaques or diaphragmatic calcifications that can be identified on the standard
 PA and lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no new significant abnormalities during
 latest examination interval.
