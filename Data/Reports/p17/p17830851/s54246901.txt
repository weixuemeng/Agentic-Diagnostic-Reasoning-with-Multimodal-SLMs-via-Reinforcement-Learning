                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // pls eval for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette, with sternotomy wires noted, is prominent,
 but probably unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring, with
 interstitial edema, consistent with CHF.  This could be very slightly
 improved.
 
 However, there is new right base opacity and new obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Although not fully characterized, the appearance is compatible
 with a small effusion underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Small left effusion is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with interstitial edema, equivocally slightly improved compared with ___.  Note is made, however, the inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.
 
 New opacity at the right base, not fully characterized, but likely combination
 of a small effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
