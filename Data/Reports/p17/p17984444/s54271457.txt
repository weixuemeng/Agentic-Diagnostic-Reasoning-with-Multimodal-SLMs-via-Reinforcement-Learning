 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unremarkable
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  No focal opacifiction concerning for
 pneumonia; however, the esophagus is air-filled and there is a suggestion of
 lower lobe bronchial wall thickening. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 identified.  Multiple compression deformities are noted on the lateral view,
 at least one of which appears new compared to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. No acute intrathoracic process. Air-filled esophagus is suggestive of
 esophageal dysmotility. Lower lobe bronchial wall thickening may be indictive
 of chronic aspiration.
 2. Multiple lower thoracic/upper lumbar compression deformities identified, at
 least one of which appears new compared to ___.
