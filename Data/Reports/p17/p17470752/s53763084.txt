 to avoid accidental intubation of the right main bronchus.  The right
 hemodialysis catheter is in unchanged position.  Newly inserted nasogastric
 tube and left Swan-Ganz catheter, the tip projects over the outflow tract of
 the pulmonary artery.  Mild left pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema and
 normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of larger pleural
 effusions.
