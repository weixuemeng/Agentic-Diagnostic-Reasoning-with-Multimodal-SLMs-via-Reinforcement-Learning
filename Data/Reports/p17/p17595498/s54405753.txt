                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing pain in the back and pain in the chest due to metastatic
 non-small cell lung cancer.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest CT from___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable, although
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted on the prior CT.  Right hilar
 enlargement is compatible with known lymphadenopathy.  3.5 cm right upper lobe
 mass and 1.4 cm ill-defined nodule within the medial aspect of the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe are compatible with known sites of malignancy. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and evidence of
 emphysematous changes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous
 structures which limits detailed assessment.  Known osseous metastatic lesions
 involving the thoracic spine, predominantly within the upper thoracic spine as
 well as within the ribs bilaterally are better seen on the recent CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe 3.5 cm mass and 1.4 cm ill-defined nodule in the left lower
 lobe compatible with known malignancy.  Unchanged right hilar adenopathy, and
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen on the prior CT.  Diffuse osseous
 metastatic lesions are better seen on the prior CT and diffuse osteopenia
 limits assessment of the osseous structures.  If there is continued concern
 for a fracture, then CT is suggested.
