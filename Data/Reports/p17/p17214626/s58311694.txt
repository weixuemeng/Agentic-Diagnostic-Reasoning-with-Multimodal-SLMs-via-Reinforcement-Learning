 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 13:06
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, fevers, question infiltrate.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 13:06 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left lung is grossly clear with the exception of linear opacities at the
 left base which likely reflect scarring.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 of uncertain significance, and the right costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included on the study.  There is patchy opacity at the right base which could
 reflect compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Interval removal of the right Port-A-Cath. 
 No pneumothorax.
