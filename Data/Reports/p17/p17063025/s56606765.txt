 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip is 7 cm
 from the carina, between the clavicular heads.  Enteric tube passes below the
 field of view with side-port past the GE junction. Increased interstitial
 markings throughout the lungs suggestive of emphysema with superimposed
 interstitial edema. Nodular opacity again projects over the anterior right
 fifth rib. There is no focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip 7 cm from the carina and could be advanced 2-3 cm for optimal
