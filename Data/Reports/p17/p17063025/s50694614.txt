                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS, intubated  // eval for interval change
 eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change.
 Again the cardiac size is within normal limits. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications are unchanged, consistent with alveolar fluid at, bilateral
 pleural effusions, and basilar atelectasis.  In view of the normal-sized
 heart, the possibility of a ARDS and superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical situations.
