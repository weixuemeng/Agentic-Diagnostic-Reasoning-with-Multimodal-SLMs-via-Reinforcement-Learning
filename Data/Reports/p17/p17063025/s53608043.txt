                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with trauma last week and pain in the right
 lateral ribs with basilar rales and cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia and
 fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___, dating back to ___.  This study is read in conjunction with
 CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Hyperinflation of
 bilateral lungs is again seen, consistent with COPD.  No new focal
 consolidations, pleural effusions or soft tissue changes are noted since the
 prior exam.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Bilateral apical opacities likely
 representing scarring remain unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  If evaluation for fracture is indicated, recommend detailed
 views of the area of focal physical exam findings.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pneumonia, effusions, pneumothorax or soft tissue abnormality.
 Unchanged bilateral apical scarring and COPD.
