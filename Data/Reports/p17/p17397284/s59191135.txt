                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MVC with femur fracture, now with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hazy opacification of the left
 hemithorax with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, suggesting layering
 pleural effusions.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  The right lung is
 essentially clear and there is no definite vascular congestion.
