                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with recent mulitfocal pneumonia and new effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multifocal consolidative opacities are again demonstrated within the upper and
 lower lobes bilaterally, perhaps slightly improved in the right lung but
 appear worse in the left lung. Additionally new moderate size pleural based
 opacity is seen laterally within the left hemithorax, likely reflecting a
 partially loculated left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
 There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size is difficult to assess given the left
 basilar consolidation. Mediastinal contour appears unchanged. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Multifocal consolidative opacities in both lungs compatible with pneumonia,
 perhaps slightly improved in the right lung, but appears worse in left lung
 though this may be compounded due to the presence of atelectasis. Interval
 development of new moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion.
