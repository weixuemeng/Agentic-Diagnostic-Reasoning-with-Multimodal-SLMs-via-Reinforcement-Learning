                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study there has been new opacification of the right lung base,
 obscuring the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm.  This is likely a
 function of consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes, as well
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Additionally, there is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 No left-sided pleural effusion.  Right chest wall port catheter terminates in
 the upper right atrium and a left-sided PICC line has been retracted since the
 prior study, not terminating in the mid SVC.  Enteric tube is beyond the
 diaphragm.  Partially imaged PTBD, common bile duct and duodenal stents are
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacification and pleural fluid at the right lung base, likely affecting
 the middle and lower lobes.  Pneumonia is a strong consideration.
