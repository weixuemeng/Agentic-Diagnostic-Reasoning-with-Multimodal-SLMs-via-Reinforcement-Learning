                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bilateral upper extremity swelling.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Left basilar pleural effusion appears slightly smaller
 when compared to prior.  There is new small right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Nodular opacities at the left lung base again seen previously characterized as
 rounded atelectasis on prior CT scan.  Superimposed linear opacity at the
 right lung base is most suggestive of atelectasis.  Superiorly the lungs are
 clear.  Single-lead pacing device seen with tip in the right ventricle. 
 Median sternotomy wires again seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Left upper extremity vascular stents partially visualized. 
 Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly smaller on the left but new
 on the right compared to ___.  Right basilar linear opacity most
 likely due to atelectasis however clinical correlation would be necessary to
 exclude component of infection.
