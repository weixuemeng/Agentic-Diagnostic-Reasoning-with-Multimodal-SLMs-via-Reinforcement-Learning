                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fevers and unclear focus of infection.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Left lower lobe consolidation and left
 pleural effusion appear unchanged.  Minimal right pleural effusion is
 unchanged as well.  Left lower lobe infection would be a possibility to
 explain patient's symptoms, especially given its gradual progression since
 ___.  On the other hand, previously demonstrated right upper lobe
 consolidation on ___ radiograph has resolved consistent with
 resolution of infection/aspiration.
 
 The lateral view demonstrates anterior loculated lucency projecting behind the
 sternum, and potentially might reflect loculated air collection within the
 pleural space, not visible on the multiple AP portable radiographs.
