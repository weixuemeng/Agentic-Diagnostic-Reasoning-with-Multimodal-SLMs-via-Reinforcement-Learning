                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male who is on dialysis, now with hypoxia.  Evaluate
 for evidence of volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an ill-defined opacity in the anterior segment of the
 right upper lobe, well delineated by the minor fissure, which is new compared
 with prior exam.  There is also an ill defined opacification of the right
 lower lung field obscuring the right hear border.  In the left, there is a
 moderate pleural effusion with concurrent atelectasis, and a peripheral
 opacity in the lower lung field that was seen in prior exam and might
 represent loculated effusion versus scarring.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.  
 2.  Right middle lobe opacity might represent pneumonia versus atelectasis. 
 3.  Left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent atelectasis and peripheral
 opacity which might represent scarring although superimposed pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.
