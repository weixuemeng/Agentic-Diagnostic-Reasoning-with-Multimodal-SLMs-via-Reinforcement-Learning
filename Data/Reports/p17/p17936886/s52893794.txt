 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  A
 right-sided pacemaker device has been placed, terminating in the right
 ventricle.  There is a moderate pleural effusion on the left with associated
 opacity, probably due to atelectasis, including volume loss and mild leftward
 shift of mediastinal structures.  Aside from streaky and band-like opacities
 in the right lower lung suggesting minor atelectasis, the right lung appears
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion of the right or pneumothorax.  There is
 no definite evidence for free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with substantial suspected
 atelectasis.  No evidence for free air.
