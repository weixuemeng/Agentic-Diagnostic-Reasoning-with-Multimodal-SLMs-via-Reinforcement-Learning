                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New cough and low-grade as well as tachycardia.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the left mid to upper lung is limited given
 positioning of the patient's head, with the chin superimposed over this
 region.  Of note, the radiology technologist attempted to reposition the
 patient but was not able to clear the chin from obscuring lung parenchyma.  A
 right-sided pacemaker and right ventricular lead are redemonstrated.  There
 are multiple midline sternotomy wires and evidence of prior CABG.  A single
 surgical clip is noted in the left upper abdominal quadrant.  A vascular stent
 is again seen in the left axilla.  A moderate left pleural effusion is
 substantially increased compared to the prior study from ___. 
 Left retrocardiac dense opacification is likely compressive atelectasis,
 although infection in this region is not excluded.  The right lung is clear. 
 There is marked rightward curvature of the thoracic spine that is at least
 partially attributable to patient positioning.  There is no right
 pneumothorax.  Evaluation for left pneumothorax is limited given obscuration
 of the left lung apex, previously discussed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to patient positioning.  Increased moderate
 left pleural effusion and degree of dense retrocardiac opacification that
 likely reflects compressive atelectasis.
