                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Vomiting, poor historian.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Right-sided pacer
 device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Left
 axillary vascular stent is re- identified.  Heart size remains moderately
 enlarged.  Lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 calcification of the thoracic aorta re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Ill-defined nodular opacity within the right mid lung field is new and may
 reflect a focus of infection.  Additionally bibasilar airspace opacities
 appear progressed compared to the previous exam and could reflect atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration are not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion
 persists, with a component loculated laterally, and is perhaps slightly
 increased compared to the prior study, with the right pleural effusion
 appearing essentially resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 2. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but aspiration or
 infection are not excluded.
 
 3. Small left pleural effusion, perhaps minimally increased compared to the
 previous exam, with resolution of previously noted right pleural effusion.
 
 4. Ill defined nodular opacity in the right mid lung field is new, possibly an
 area of infection.
