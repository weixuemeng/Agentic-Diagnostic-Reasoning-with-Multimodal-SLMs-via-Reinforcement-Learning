                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Rising white blood cell count in the setting of recent pneumonia,
 presumed aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recently on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right perihilar parenchymal opacity has resolved, though there
 is a prominence of the paramediastinal border at the level of the right hilum.
 The left pleural effusion and atelectasis are little changed.  The aorta is
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right perihilar prominence would be better evaluated with PA and
 lateral radiographs.
