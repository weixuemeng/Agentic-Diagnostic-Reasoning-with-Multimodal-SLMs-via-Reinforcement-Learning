 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening effusion, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is better
 visualization of the left hemithorax.  There is a moderate left pleural
 effusion, combined to relatively large left lower lobe parenchymal opacity. 
 The opacities also seen at the bases of the ventilated parts of the left lung,
 approximately at the hilar level.  The findings are strongly suggestive of a
 combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.
 
 The findings were communicated at the time of image acquisition.
 
 The appearance of the left lung, minimal atelectasis and a small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pulmonary edema.
