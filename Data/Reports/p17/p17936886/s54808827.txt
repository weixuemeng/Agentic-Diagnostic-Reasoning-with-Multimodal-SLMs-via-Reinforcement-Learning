                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumonia and extubation.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are lower lung volumes.  Right perihilar upper lobe pneumonic
 consolidation is grossly unchanged.  Allowing the difference in positioning of
 the patient, there is minimal interval increase in left upper lobe opacity. 
 This could be atelectasis or pneumonia.  Cardiac size is obscured by pleural
 abnormalities.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Moderate left
 pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis are stable.
