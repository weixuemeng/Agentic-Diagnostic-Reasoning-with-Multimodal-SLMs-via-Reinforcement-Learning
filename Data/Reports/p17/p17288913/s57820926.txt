                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral swelling.  Question edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is probably
 a small pleural effusion on the right and it is difficult to exclude a small
 subpulmonic effusion on the right side.  The interstitium is prominent
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema, but there is no focal opacification.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest mild pulmonary edema.
