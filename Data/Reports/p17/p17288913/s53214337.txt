                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits with aortic calcifications.  Increased
 density in the region of the right hilum likely corresponds to
 lymphadenopathy, as seen on prior CT, and appears similar compared to multiple
 recent prior exams.  Widening of the acromioclavicular joints, right greater
 than left, with soft tissue mineralization, appears similar compared to
 multiple prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest radiographs without radiographic evidence for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
