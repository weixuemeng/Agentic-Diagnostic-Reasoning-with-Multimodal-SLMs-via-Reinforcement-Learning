                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pain in PICC.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided PICC is seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right
 atrium, as best seen on the lateral view, could be withdrawn 2 cm.  Otherwise,
 the appearance of the chest is unchanged compared the prior study.  No focal
 consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Prominence of the right hilum
 is stable.  There is a likely hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left-sided PICC, distal aspect not well seen on the frontal view, but on the
 lateral view appears to terminate at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right
 atrium and could be withdrawn by 2 cm.  Otherwise, there has been no
 significant interval change.
