                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia is present,
 with otherwise unremarkable mediastinal contours.  The right hilum appears
 slightly larger and more dense than the left hilum, and note is made of report
 of right hilar lymphadenopathy on previous CTA of the chest of ___.  Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.  There are no acute skeletal
 findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Persistent right hilar prominence, likely corresponding to enlarged right
 hilar lymph nodes on prior chest CTA in this patient with history of lymphoma.
