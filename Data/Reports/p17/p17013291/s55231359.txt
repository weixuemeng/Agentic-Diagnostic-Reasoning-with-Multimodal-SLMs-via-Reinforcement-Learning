 New widening of the mediastinum at the level of the vascular pedicle suggests
 increased in central venous pressure or volume, or both.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is also engorged and the heart is slightly larger suggesting early
 biventricular cardiac decompensation which can be a cause of wheezing even
 though there is no appreciable pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumonia or
 appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
