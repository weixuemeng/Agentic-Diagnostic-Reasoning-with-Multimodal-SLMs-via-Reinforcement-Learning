 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:12 PM
  1. 2 chest tubes in the left hemithorax. ET tube in mid trachea.
  2. Decrease in left-sided pleural effusion.
  3. Increased opacity overlying the right lower lobe may represent atelectasis.
  Pneumonia must be excluded in the proper clinical setting. Small right pleural
  effusion likely persists.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:20 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left thoracotomy and pericardial window, evaluate position of chest
 tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Opacification in the right lower hemithorax is new.  Since it is traversed by
 air bronchograms, I think it more likely consolidation in the middle or lower
 lobe than pleural effusion, and as such possible pneumonia.  Two left-sided
 drainage tubes project over the cardiac silhouette and left lower hemithorax,
 terminating at the level of the left hilus, but impossible to localize on a
 single frontal view.  The volume of the heart shadow is not much changed
 although the shape is different, and this could represent pericardial
 drainage.  There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.
