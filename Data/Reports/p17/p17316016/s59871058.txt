                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 14:59
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mitral valve placement and left lower
 lobe infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 20:30.
 
 AP portable upright chest film ___ at 14:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, left subclavian central line, gastric tube and left
 basilar pigtail catheter remain in place.  Status post median sternotomy with
 valve replacement.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable
 given patient rotation on the current examination.  Persistent linear opacity
 at the right base likely represents patchy atelectasis.  The right pleural
 effusion appears somewhat smaller. The pulmonary vascularity appears less well
 defined on the current examination which suggests superimposed mild pulmonary
 and interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
