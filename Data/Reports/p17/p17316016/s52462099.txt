                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___, AT ___.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post pericardial window, evaluate for
 progression of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON TO PRIOR STUDY:  ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___, at ___ is submitted.  The study is
 technically limited due to marked patient rotation to the left which limits
 evaluation of the left apex where on the prior study, there was a subtle left
 apical pneumothorax.  Followup imaging should be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Persistent but reduced low lung volumes with increasing layering right
 pleural effusion.  Left pleural pigtail catheter remains in place.  Left
 subclavian central line with tip in proximal SVC.  There is likely patchy
 opacity at both bases suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although
 bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No large pneumothorax is
 seen, but evaluation of the left apex is limited.  Status post median
 sternotomy.  Assessment of overall cardiac and mediastinal contours is not
 possible given the marked patient rotation on the current examination and the
 lordotic technique.
