  pneumonia; a coinciding pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain after cardiac surgery.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  The patient is status post
 sternotomy.  Dense mitral annular calcifications are again present.  The heart
 is moderately enlarged.  There is similar relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Lung volumes are low.  On the right, blunting of the right
 costophrenic sulcus is again noted making it difficult to exclude a small
 pleural effusion.  Confluent opacification is noted in the left retrocardiac
 region with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Accordingly, parenchymal
 opacification is suspected and a pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. 
 Pneumonia or atelectasis could explain the findings.  Persistent apical
 pleural thickening on the left may reflect slight scarring, which appears
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity.  Differential
 considerations include extensive atelectasis or pneumonia; also a pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded in the area.
