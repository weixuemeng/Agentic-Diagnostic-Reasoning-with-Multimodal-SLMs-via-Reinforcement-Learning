                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 9:59.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mitral valve replacement, rule out
 collapse.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 11:23.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:15 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube.
 The left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Given the patient's rotation on
 the current examination, evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is
 not possible.  There does appear to be increasing airspace consolidation in
 the left mid and lower lung which could reflect combination of layering
 effusion with partial lower lobe atelectasis.  There is increasing linear
 opacity at the right base as well suggestive of atelectasis.  No pulmonary
 edema is appreciated.  No pneumothorax is seen.
