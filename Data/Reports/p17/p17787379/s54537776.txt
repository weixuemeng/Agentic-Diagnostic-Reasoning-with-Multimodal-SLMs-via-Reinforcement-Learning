                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are lower
 lung volumes.  Continued mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm on the left
 is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and layering pleural
 effusion.
