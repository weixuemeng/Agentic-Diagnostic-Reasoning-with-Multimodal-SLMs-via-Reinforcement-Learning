                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vascularity is not
 engorged.  Linear opacities overlying the right lung base likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  Deformity of the left chest wall is unchanged. 
 Mild compression deformity of an upper lumbar vertebral body is unchanged. 
 There is diffuse calcification of the imaged aorta and multilevel degenerative
 changes of the thoracic spine are again seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Blunting of left costophrenic angle is chronic, and likely
 reflects pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base, but no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
