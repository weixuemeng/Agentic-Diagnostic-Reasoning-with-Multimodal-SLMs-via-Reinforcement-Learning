                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:18 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with SLE and treatment of recent pneumonia. 
 Transferred from an outside hospital with shortness of breath, fever and
 malaise.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___
 
 Previous right lower lobe pneumonia has cleared.  Base of the left lung is
 elevated, and there is some decrease in aeration of the left lung base. 
 Lateral view would be most helpful in determining if there is enough
 abnormality in the left lower lobe to call it pneumonia.  It would also be
 useful to see if there are findings to suggest a subpulmonic left pleural
 effusion.  This may ultimately require left decubitus imaging of the chest for
 assessment.  Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by AP positioning, but it
 should be remembered that patients with SLE are at risk of pericarditis.
