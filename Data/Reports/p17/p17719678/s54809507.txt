                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  SLE nephritis, probable cardiomyopathy with increasing
 cough.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:
 
 Since the prior chest x-ray of ___, a left effusion has developed.  Some
 volume loss is present, but some of the opacification could be due to left
 lower lobe pneumonia.  Clinical correlation would be necessary.
 
 There is no evidence of failure.  The right costophrenic angle is sharp.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New onset of left effusion.  Underlying pneumonia could be
 present.
