                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with acute shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are without focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Again identified is a 1.6 x 0.8 cm density overlying the right
 hemithorax which appears stable dating back to ___ but of
 nonspecific etiology.  The ascending aorta remains prominent and although this
 can be due to tortuosity, dilatation cannot be excluded.  No acute fractures
 are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  There is stable prominence of the ascending aorta.  While this may be due
 to tortuosity, a focal dilatation cannot be excluded.  As a result, a
 dedicated chest CT is again recommended in a non-emergent setting for further
 characterization.
 3.  Also again identified is a 1.6 x 0.8 cm density overlying the right
 hemithorax which has remained stable.  While this density may be
 representative of an osseous structure, a lung nodule cannot be excluded.  As
 a result, a dedicated chest CT is again recommended in a nonemergent setting
 for further characterization.
