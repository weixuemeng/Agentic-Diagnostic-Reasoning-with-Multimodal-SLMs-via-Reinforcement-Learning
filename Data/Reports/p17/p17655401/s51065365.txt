                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 23:37
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath and atypical chest
 pain, question infiltrate or edema.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films is helpful to
 detect subtle interval change.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest dated ___ at 23:37 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The heart is enlarged and with a somewhat globular appearance raising the
 possibility of a pericardial effusion rather than cardiomegaly.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs
 appear somewhat hyperinflated, which may represent good inspiratory effort as
 the AP diameter is not increased to suggest the presence of underlying
 emphysema.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Heterogeneity to the right lateral neck soft
 tissues is likely artifactual; clinical correlation is advised.  No acute bony
 abnormality.
