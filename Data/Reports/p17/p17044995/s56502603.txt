                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis, acidosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Posterior opacity projective over the spine on the lateral view could be due
 to rotation of the patient.  Recommend repeat lateral radiograph with proper
 technique for further evaluation.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower posterior opacity projecting over the spine could be due to rotated
 position of the patient.  Recommend repeat lateral radiograph with proper
 technique to re-assess.
