                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with pulmonary fibrosis w/ increased O2 req  // ? acute
 cardiopulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There diffuse parenchymal changes throughout the lungs which involves the
 entire lung fields including the apices and bases as well. Moderate
 right-sided apical pneumothorax is noted. There is elevation of the minor
 fissure likely due to underlying parenchymal changes in the upper lobe and
 possible atelectasis. More confluent consolidation seen in the frontal view in
 the right mid lung could be due to a combination of atelectasis and chronic
 parenchymal changes. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to adequately assess
 given scoliosis and lack of visualization of the right heart border. No acute
 osseous abnormalities identified, and no displaced rib fractures on these non
 dedicated films.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Moderate right-sided pneumothorax.
 2. Fibrotic changes in the lungs. Without prior it is difficult to assess for
 superimposed acute process.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ the
 phone at 12:05, ___ min after time of discovery.
