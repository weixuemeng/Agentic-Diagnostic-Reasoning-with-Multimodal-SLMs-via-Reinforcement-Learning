                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary fibrosis w/ PTX s/p CT. Chest tube
 to water seal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 With a right-sided pigtail catheter to water seal, the small right apical
 pneumothorax has slightly increased in size. Otherwise, no significant change
 from the prior exam. Severe dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine with
 associated distortion of the thoracic cage is stable. The lungs are
 hyper-expanded, suggestive of chronic emphysema. Diffuse bilateral opacities
 and prominent interstitial markings are stable and consistent with reported
 chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Stable cardiomegaly. Left sided pleural
 thickening, of unclear etiology needs to be evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slight interval increase in the size of the small right apical pneumothorax
 after placing the chest tube to water seal.
 
 2. Left-sided pleural thickening of unclear etiology. Recommend obtaining
 prior chest radiographs for comparison and obtaining further clinical history,
 such is possible scarring from a prior left-sided chest tube placement. If the
 thickening is new, this should be investigated.
