                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath for 1 week with chest congestion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Hazy opacification within the left lung base with loss of the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour on the frontal view may reflect atelectasis or
 infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted, though there
 is likely a small amount of pleural thickening within the left costophrenic
 angle.  No acute osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis or infection.
