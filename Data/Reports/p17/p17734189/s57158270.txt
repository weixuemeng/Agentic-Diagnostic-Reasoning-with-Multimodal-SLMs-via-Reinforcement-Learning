                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with weight loss, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart
 is top normal size and mediastinal contour is notable for tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta.  There is diffuse pulmonary interstitial prominence and areas
 of architectural distortion, likely chronic.  Surgical chain sutures are
 present in the left mid lung.  Increased opacification in the retrocardiac
 left lower lobe is not well evaluated and may represent atelectasis,
 consolidation or potentially a mass.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacification in the left lower lobe, better appreciated on the
 lateral view, is not well evaluated and may represent atelectasis or
 consolidation, or potentially a mass. An ___ view is recommended as a first
 step for further evaluation.
 
 2.  Interstitial lung disease, most prominent at the right base.
 
 
 Comment: Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ at
