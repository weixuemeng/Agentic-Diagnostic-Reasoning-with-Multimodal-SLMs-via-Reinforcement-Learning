                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with s/p unwitness fall, no complaints.  // r/o intracranial
 hemorrhage, PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Upright AP and lateral views of the chest provided.   Suture material and mild
 scarring in the left upper lobe is again noted. There is atelectasis of the
 left lung base and the possibility a in subtle pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 Right lung is clear. A tiny nodule projecting over the lateral right mid lung
 corresponds with a tiny calcified nodule on the prior CT. No large effusion is
 seen. No pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours appear stable. Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity most compatible with atelectasis though cannot exclude an
 early pneumonia.
