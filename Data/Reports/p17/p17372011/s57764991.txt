                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Very large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  An apparent area
 of adjacent opacity has developed in the right lung base, and could represent
 an area of focal aspiration, atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  Small
 pleural effusion is also noted.  When the patient's condition permits,
 standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for better
 characterization of the lower lobes.
