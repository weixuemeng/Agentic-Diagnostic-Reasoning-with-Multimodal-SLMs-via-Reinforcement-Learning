                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y F with prior episode of angioedema admitted with severe
 angioedema, likely ACE-induced. Intubated and admitted to FICU.  // interval
 change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___ to, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
 fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with volume loss in
 the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.  The opacification at the right
 base, consistent with fluid and atelectasis, is less pronounced on the current
 study.  The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude, especially in the retrocardiac region, in the absence of a lateral
 view.
 The endotracheal tube remains in good position.  It is very difficult to see
 the lower portion of the nasogastric tube, with the tip having been pulled
 back to the distal esophagus.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Because the tip of the nasogastric tube can only be
 followed to the distal esophagus, consideration could be given to obtaining a
 view of the lower chest and upper abdomen using abdominal technique to
 conclusively determine whether the tip of the tube extends to the stomach.
