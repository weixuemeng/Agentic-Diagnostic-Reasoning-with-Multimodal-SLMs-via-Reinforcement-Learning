                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y F with prior episode of angioedema admitted with severe
 angioedema, likely ACE-induced. Intubated and admitted to FICU.  // evaluation
 of OG tube     evaluation of OG tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac silhouette
 remains enlarged with mild fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Bibasilar opacifications are again
 seen with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  Although this could merely
 represent atelectatic changes involving lower lobes, in the appropriate
 clinical setting the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 Endotracheal tube remains in good position.  There has been placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach.
