                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with thoracic paraspinal pain s/p MVC  // eval
 for traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded and clear. The heart is not enlarged.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. There is mild pleural thickening at the lung apices. Within the
 limitations of routine chest radiography no displaced rib fractures detected.
 The upper thoracic spine is obscured by the patient's shoulders but the
 remaining visualized thoracic levels normal vertebral heights, disc spaces and
 alignment.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite acute intrathoracic injury. However, this study is suboptimal for
 evaluation of the thoracic spine.  If clinically indicated dedicated
 radiographs of the thoracic spine or CT may be obtained.
