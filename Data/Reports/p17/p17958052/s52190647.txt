                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent aortic valve replacement who is now
 presenting with several days of worsening DOE and orthopnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of small bilateral
 pleural effusions, left greater than right. The pleural effusion on the left
 appears slightly increased in size while the effusion on the right is
 unchanged. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with mild atherosclerotic
 calcification noted at the aortic knob. Prosthetic aortic valve is again
 demonstrated. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is compressive
 atelectasis at the lung bases. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size on the left, and
 unchanged in size of the right with associated compressive bibasilar
 atelectasis.
