                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with PICC line in  right upper extremity
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PICC tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium, not
 substantially changed from the previous study.  Heart size remains mildly
 enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the left, likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There may be a tiny left pleural effusion, not
 substantially changed in the interval, with resolution of the previously noted
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PICC tip terminates at the SVC/right atrial junction.
 2. Bibasilar atelectasis and unchanged tiny left pleural effusion.  Previously
 noted small right pleural effusion has resolved.
