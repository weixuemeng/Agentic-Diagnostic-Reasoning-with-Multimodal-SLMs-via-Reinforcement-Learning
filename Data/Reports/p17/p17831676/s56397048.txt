                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CMV viremia/colitis on ganciclovir, now
 febrile.  // PNA, PCP? Pt immunosuppressed.      PNA, PCP? Pt
 immunosuppressed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left hemidiaphragm is not as
 sharply seen.  This could represent some respiratory motion, though the
 possibility of small effusion and atelectasis would have to be considered. No
 definite acute focal pneumonia, though this is difficult to unequivocally
 exclude in the absence of a lateral view.
 Central catheter is unchanged.
