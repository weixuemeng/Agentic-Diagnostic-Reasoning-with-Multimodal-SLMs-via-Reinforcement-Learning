                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung
 volumes are low.  Bibasilar streaky opacities are most compatible with
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the CP angle is noted posteriorly which could
 indicate a small pleural effusion on the left.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung atelectasis with possible small left effusion.
