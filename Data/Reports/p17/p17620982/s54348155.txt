 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  LORDOTIC POSITIONING.
 
 Possible background COPD.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There is some
 hazy and minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base.  There is also
 increased retrocardiac density, slightly worse than on ___.  No left-sided
 effusion.  No CHF.  Cardiac silhouette likely unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy and hazy opacity at the right lung base and new
 increased retrocardiac density.  tHE Possibility of an infectious infiltrate
 cannot be excluded.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for
 further assessment.
