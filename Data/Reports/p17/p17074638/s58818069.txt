                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with head injury and temp intubated  // pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar consolidations continue to worsen, concerning for bibasilar
 pneumonia. Prominent airspace opacity at the left hilum may represent an
 additional focus of infection.  There is probably no pleural effusion. The
 endotracheal tube ends 2.8 cm from the carina with the chin down.  The enteric
 tube passes into a decompressed stomach and outside of the field of view. Low
 lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. There is no pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema. The heart is stably moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increasing bibasilar and left hilar consolidations, compatible with
 multifocal pneumonia.
 2. All lines and tubes in standard position.
