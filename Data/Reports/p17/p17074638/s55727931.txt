                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intracranial hemorrhage, endotracheal tube
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 3.6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip
 is within the stomach. Heart is moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. 
 Fullness of the right superior mediastinal border may be due to tortuous
 vascular structures. There is no pulmonary edema. Consolidative opacity with
 air bronchograms is noted in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality seen. There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.
 2. Mild left basilar consolidation, with which may reflect infection,
 aspiration and/or atelectasis.
 3. Prominent right superior mediastinal contour, possibly due to tortuous
 vessels.
