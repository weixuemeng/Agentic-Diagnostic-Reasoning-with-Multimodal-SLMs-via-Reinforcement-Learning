 Interval improvement since ___ of the focal increased opacity with air
 bronchograms and associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm in the right

 significant interval change. Stable prominent cardiomegaly and widened
 mediastinum. Stable bilateral low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or

 is only clearly seen down to the level of the mid and lower thorax, but a
 sulcal likely unchanged.
