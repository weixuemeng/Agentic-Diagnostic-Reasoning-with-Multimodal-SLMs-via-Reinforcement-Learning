 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach ___ stroke  // eval for trach, now has
 been pulled out x2 and replaced      eval for trach, now has been pulled out
 x2 and replaced
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The small tracheostomy tube is midline but may have a very short intra
 tracheal excursion. A lateral view is necessary for that determination.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is chronic but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved
 since earlier in the day.  Peribronchial opacification in the right lung base
 could be atelectasis caused by the chronically and severely elevated right
 hemidiaphragm or could be early pneumonia.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are
 small if any.
