                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia  // please evaluate for acute
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 A right PIC line is seen with its tip terminating in the distal SVC.  A drain
 is seen overlying the right upper quadrant. There is opacification of the left
 base, consistent with atelectasis, with associated pleural effusion that is
 unchanged from prior study.  There is near-complete collapse of the right
 lower lobe with a moderate layering effusion and elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm, unchanged from prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Imaged osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 Significant dilatation of gas-filled bowel within the visualized portion of
 the abdomen, grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PIC line with tip terminating in the distal SVC.
 2. Left basilar atelectasis with associated moderate pleural effusion,
 unchanged.
 3. Near-complete right lower lobe collapse with moderate layering effusion and
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
