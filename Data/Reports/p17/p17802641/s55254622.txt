                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Frequent falls.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral flattening of the hemidiaphragms
 is unchanged from the prior exam.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 No rib fracture is identified.  The patient is rotated on the lateral image,
 which somewhat limits examination of the thoracic spine, but no definite
 compression fracture is identified.  Degenerative changes are noted in the
 bilateral shoulders, slightly more prominent on the left than the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 2.  No fracture identified.
