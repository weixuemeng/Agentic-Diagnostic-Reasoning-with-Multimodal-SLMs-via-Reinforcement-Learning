  Increasing retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, though
  pneumonia/aspiration within the differential.  No overt pulmonary edema. No
  large pleural effusions.  Unchanged low lung volumes.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cirrhosis, continued bacterial peritonitis, crackles
 and suspicious for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Increase in retrocardiac opacity on this AP radiograph might reflect
 atelectasis but pneumonia is in differential.  In addition, there is increase
 in the left perihilar opacity, potentially reflecting pneumonia as well.  No
 pulmonary edema is seen.  No large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Lung
 volumes continue to be low.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
