                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there again are areas of
 increased opacification at the bases, silhouetting the hemidiaphragm on the
 left.  In view of the clinical history, these could represent zones of
 aspiration with left effusion.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessel suggests
 some degree of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
