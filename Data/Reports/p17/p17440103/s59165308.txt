                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubation, pneumonia,
 respiratory distress, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6.7 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, coiling in the expected location of the gastric fundus.  Mild
 bibasilar opacities are seen, right greater than left, which could relate to
 aspiration though an early infectious process cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Mild bibasilar, right greater than left, subtle opacities may relate to
 aspiration or possible pulmonary vascular engorgement although underlying
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
