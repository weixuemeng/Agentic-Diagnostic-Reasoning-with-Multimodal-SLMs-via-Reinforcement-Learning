 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  The left lung is substantially better expanded
 than on the previous image.  Currently there is no convincing radiographic
 evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.  The areas of pleural thickening
 and pleural calcification on the right are stable.  The small right pleural
 effusion is also unchanged.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has decreased
 but is overall still enlarged.  Moderate tortuosity of the descending aorta. 
 Stability in position of the sternal wires.
