                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVA w/ rib fracture and pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion; please eval for interval change.  // eval pleural effusion,
 chest tube     eval pleural effusion, chest tube
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes but there may be mild
 pulmonary edema.  Combination of atelectasis, moderate right pleural effusion
 and calcification of the pleura is unchanged alongside multiple displaced
 right rib fractures.  If there is pneumothorax it is not large, but chest CT
 scanning would be needed to exclude it.
