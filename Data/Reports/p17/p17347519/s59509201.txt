                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  Please evaluate
 for PICC line position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated back to ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The left-sided PICC line projects over the left axilla, likely in the left
 axillary vein.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable compared to exams dating back to
 at least ___.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent, however opacities overlying the
 perihilar and mid to lower lung field bilaterally has increased and is likely
 secondary to worsening moderate pulmonary edema.  Calcification is again noted
 of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta, otherwise the hilar and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided PICC line projects over the left axilla, likely in the left
 axillary vein. 
 
 2.  Worsening moderate pulmonary edema, particularly in the lung bases.
