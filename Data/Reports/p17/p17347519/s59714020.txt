                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea, evaluate for pulmonary edema or
 consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 There is interval placement of a dialysis catheter through a left subclavian
 approach terminating in the right atrium.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 There is persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with
 adjacent compressive atelectasis most notable at the right base.  There is
 diffusely increased bilateral opacification, more pronounced in the perihilar
 regions consistent with increased pulmonary venous congestion and moderate
 edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased moderate pulmonary edema with persistent mildly increased
 bilateral pleural effusions, left more than left and adjacent compressive
 atelectasis.
 
 2.  Interval placement of a dialysis catheter terminating in the right atrium.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly, stable.
