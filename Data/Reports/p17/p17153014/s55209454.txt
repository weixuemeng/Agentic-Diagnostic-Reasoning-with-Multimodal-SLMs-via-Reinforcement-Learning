                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The aorta shows mild unfolding
 and calcification.  The main pulmonary artery contour is perhaps minimally
 prominent.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacities
 in the right middle lobe are not specific, although commonly due to
 atelectasis.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right middle lobe opacity, which could be seen with
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia is not excluded, however.
