                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with weakness.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  AP chest radiograph dated ___.  PA and lateral chest
 radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded.  Slight increased opacity in the right infrahilar
 region seen only on the frontal view does not have a definite correlate on the
 lateral view, possibly reflecting atelectasis versus an early bronchopneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical situation.  No edema, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinum is not widened.  Left lower
 lung opacity is probably atelectasis, overall similar to ___.  No acute
 osseous abnormality.  Fiducial markers projecting over the right upper
 quadrant are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight increased opacity in the right infrahilar region on only the frontal
 view may reflect atelectasis versus early bronchopneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical situation.
