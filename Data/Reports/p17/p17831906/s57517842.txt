                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Followup effusions.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternal wires and right IJ line are unchanged.  There is a moderate
 right effusion and small left effusion, both of which are larger than on the
 prior study.  A few air-fluid levels are seen in the left upper quadrant in
 non-dilated loops of bowel, likely due to an ileus.
