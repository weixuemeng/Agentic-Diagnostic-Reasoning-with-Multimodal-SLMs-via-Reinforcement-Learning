 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Right-sided IJV CVP has been removed.  Stable mediastinal
 post CABG changes.  Increased opacity in the left lower lobe, but this finding
 may be aggravated by the lower lung volumes.  Small associated left-sided
 pleural effusion.  Linear atelectasis seen in the lateral aspect of the left
 lower lung zone.  Suspected small right-sided pleural effusion.  No pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Spondylotic changes of the thoracic spine.

 Nonspecific opacification seen in the left lower lobe which shows interval
 progression compared to previous imaging and may represent atelectasis (low
 lung volumes) or developing pneumonia.  Small associated left-sided effusion.
