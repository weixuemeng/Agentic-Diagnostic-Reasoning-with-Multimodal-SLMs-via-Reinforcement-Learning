                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is patchy opacity in the lingula, obscuring the left cardiac
 border on the frontal view.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The hila and
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular opacity may represent atelectasis, but potentially pneumonia or even
 aspiration in the appropriate setting.  Chronicity is also uncertain;
 correlation with prior radiographs may prove helpful in determining acuity.
