                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Motor vehicle crash.  Evaluate for acute trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Normal heart, lungs,
 pleural and mediastinal surfaces.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.  Conventional chest radiographs
 are not sensitive for detecting subtle chest wall trauma. If there are focal
 findings, dedidcated views of those areas are recommended.
