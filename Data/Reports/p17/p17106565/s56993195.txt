  Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding.  Asymmetric opacity in the
  right lung makes it impossible to exclude a pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, asthma exacerbations.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding.  It is impossible to
 exclude a pneumonia in the right lung.  No evidence of pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces
 are normal.  Lower thoracic spinal stimulator noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and may be responsible for
 simulating interstitial infiltration particularly in the right lung, making it
 impossible  to exclude a pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.

 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat conventional chest radiographs at appropriate level
 of inspiration
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 08:00 on ___, ___ min after discovery.
