                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with confusion and fatigue  // evaluate for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates stable cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There is slight hyperexpanded lungs with flattening of bilateral
 diaphragms consistent with underlying emphysema.  Reticular opacities in the
 lower lobes bilaterally are noted.  No opacity convincing for pneumonia is
 identified.  There is no evidence of over pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Emphysematous changes without focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. 
 Reticular markings at the bases bilaterally while atypical in distribution for
 emphysema appear unchanged relative to prior examination.  These could be due
 to chronic interstitial process or potentially atypical infection.
