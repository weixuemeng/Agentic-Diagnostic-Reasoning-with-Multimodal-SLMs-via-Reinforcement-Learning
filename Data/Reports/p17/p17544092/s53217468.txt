                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are streaky
 bibasilar opacities which could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation from aspiration, contusion or infection are possible and not
 excluded.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although difficult to exclude
 trace pleural effusion, particularly on the right.  The cardiac silhouette is
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is mild-to-moderate loss of
 height of the superior endplate of at least one lower thoracic vertebral body
 of indeterminate age (no priors available for comparison).  There may be
 subtle minimal loss of height of the superior endplate of the vertebral body
 just inferior to this.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Loss of height of superior endplate of the lower thoracic vertebral body
 of indeterminate age, no priors for comparison.  In the setting of trauma, if
 clinical concern for acute injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 2.  Streaky bibasilar opacities could relate to atelectasis; however,
 consolidation due to aspiration, infection or even pulmonary contusion not
 excluded.
