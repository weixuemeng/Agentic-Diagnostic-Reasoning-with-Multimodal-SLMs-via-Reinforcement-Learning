                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of fever.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable supine radiograph of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is a subtle increase in opacification at the right lung base.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle increase in opacity at the right lung base may be secondary to
 atelectasis, however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
