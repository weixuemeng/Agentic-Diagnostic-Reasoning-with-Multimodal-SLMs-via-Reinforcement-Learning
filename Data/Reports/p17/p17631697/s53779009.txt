                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fevers, on chemotherapy.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The heart is
 of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  There is a vague
 patchy left lower lung opacity equivocal for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present.  Catheter of a left chest wall port terminates in
 the right atrium.  The left port has been accessed.  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague left lower lung opacity, possibly pneumonia; short-term
 follow-up radiographs may be useful to reassess if clinically indicated.
