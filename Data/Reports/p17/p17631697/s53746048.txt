 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, history of rectal cancer, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided. Lung volumes are somewhat low with
 subtle lower lung opacity likely representing atelectasis less likely
 pneumonia.  No effusions or pneumothorax. No signs of edema. Heart and
 mediastinal contours are normal. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle opacities in the lower lungs thought likely to represent atelectasis
 though in the correct clinical setting an early pneumonia is difficult to
 entirely exclude.
