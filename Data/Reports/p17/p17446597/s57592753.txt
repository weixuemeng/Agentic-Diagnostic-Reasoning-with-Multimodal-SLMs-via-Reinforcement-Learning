                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with subdural hematoma status post
 craniotomy, question pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 5:23.
 
 A portable AP supine chest film ___ at 7:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet.  A left
 subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  A feeding tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm.  There are large layering bilateral effusions
 with worsening bilateral airspace process, likely representing
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely unchanged in this postoperative patient status post median
 sternotomy, given differences in patient rotation between studies.  No large
 pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished
 given supine technique.
