 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, increased secretion, fluid overload, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Effusion and lung opacity on the right are constant. 
 The left lung base shows a slightly improved radiolucency, likely reflecting
 improved ventilation.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  There
 is no evidence of pneumothorax or newly appeared parenchymal abnormalities.
