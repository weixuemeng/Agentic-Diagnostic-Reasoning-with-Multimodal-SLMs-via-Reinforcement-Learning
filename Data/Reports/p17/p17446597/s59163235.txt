                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of two days earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are similar in position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Persistent pulmonary vascular
 engorgement accompanied by diffuse interstitial edema.  Worsening, more
 confluent opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left, could reflect
 dependent edema and atelectasis, but infectious pneumonia should also be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion is similar to the prior study, and there is likely also a small left
 pleural effusion.  No visible pneumothorax.
