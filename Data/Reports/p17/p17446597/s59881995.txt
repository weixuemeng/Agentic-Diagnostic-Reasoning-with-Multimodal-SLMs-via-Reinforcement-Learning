                                 FINAL REPORT
 A PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 511 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pulmonary edema and right pleural
 effusion, followup.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 717.
 
 Portable AP chest film ___ at 511 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, feeding tube and left subclavian PICC line are
 unchanged in position.  There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with
 associated bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Overall, the edema is improving, although there is likely
 residual interstitial edema on the current study.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged status post median sternotomy for CABG.  No large
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
