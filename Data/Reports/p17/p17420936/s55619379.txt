                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval increase in moderate-sized right pleural effusion with
 mild right lower lobe atelectasis and no interval change in small left pleural
 effusion. Rounded homogeneous opacity only seen on lateral projects projects
 over the anterior heart. There is no corresponding finding on the frontal
 view, so it is not necessarily a real finding.  No additional focal opacity,
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or left pleural effusion.  Heart size is
 partially obscured by pleural parenchymal process and mediastinal contour and
 hila are otherwise normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increase in moderate-sized right pleural effusion with mild right lower
 lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Possible pulmonary nodule. Chest CT would provide definitive evaluation.
