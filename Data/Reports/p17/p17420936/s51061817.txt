                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Known pleural effusions in past, now with shortness of
 breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles suggests
 small pleural effusions which appear slightly increased as compared to the
 prior study.  Left base opacity likely relates to pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded, although felt
 less likely.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  No
 overt pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, appear slightly increased as
 compared to the prior study.
