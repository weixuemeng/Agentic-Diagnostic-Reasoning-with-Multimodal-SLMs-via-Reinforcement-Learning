                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with liver failure.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating 7
 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach.  Right
 internal jugular central venous catheter projects over proximal SVC. 
 Swan-Ganz catheter is in unchanged position.  Left internal jugular central
 venous catheter is at the cavoatrial junction.  No appreciable pneumothorax.
 
 Low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular markings.  Left lung base
 consolidation persists, likely atelectasis.  Trace left pleural effusion is
 likely.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Increased opacification of the left hemithorax may
 reflect mild asymmetric pulmonary edema or pleural fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left lung base consolidation, most likely atelectasis, with
 associated small left pleural effusion.  Asymmetric opacification of the left
 hemithorax likely represents mild asymmetric pulmonary edema.
