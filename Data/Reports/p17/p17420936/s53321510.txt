                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with HCV cirrhosis, status post liver
 transplant with low-grade fever, new diagnosis of CMB viremia, assess for
 intrapulmonary process.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 11:53.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 8:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient
 rotation and somewhat lordotic technique on the current study.  Lungs appear
 grossly clear with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia,
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic
 angles could reflect pleural thickening or tiny effusions.  No acute bony
 abnormality.
