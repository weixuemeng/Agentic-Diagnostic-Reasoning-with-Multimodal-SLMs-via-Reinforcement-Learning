                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent adjustment of ET tube.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Given the degree of rotated positioning, the
 conventional ET tube/carina relationship is not demonstrated.  Allowing for
 this, the tip of the ET tube appears to lie 7.8 cm above the carina and 1.8 cm
 above the superior edge of the medial clavicular heads, relatively high.  A
 Swan-Ganz catheter is present -- the tip overlies the cardiac silhouette,
 possibly related to the RV outflow tract, but difficult to confirm due to
 rotation.  A left IJ central line is present, tip likely overlying the
 proximal/mid SVC, unchanged.  A left subclavian PICC line appears to be
 present.  However, the tip lies immediately inside the lateral left thoracic
 cage and does not extend to the central venous vasculature.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density is unchanged.  Atelectasis at the right base is
 also unchanged.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube lies 7.8 cm above the carina and 1.8 cm above the superior edge of
 the medial clavicular heads, relatively high.  Clinical correlation requested.
 
 2.  Left-sided PICC line does not extend beyond the lateral edge of the left
 lung.  Please see comment above.
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
