                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Night sweats.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 a 4-mm nodule projecting over the anterior left fourth rib.  This could be
 superimposition of normal structures.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.  Nodular
 opacity in the left lung should be evaluated with oblique views.
 
 Findings were posted in the critical results reporting system to be conveyed
 to the referring physician.
