                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of asthma, CHF presenting with shortness of breath for 3
 weeks, wheezing.  Evaluate for pneumonia, pleural effusion, CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTA and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Dual left-sided AICD is
 in standard position and its leads terminate in the right atrium and right
 ventricle, expected locations.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within
 normal limits.  Lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the bronchovascular
 structures. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Stable mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
