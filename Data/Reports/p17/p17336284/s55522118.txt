                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, asthma hx, evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild bronchial wall thickening is new from prior studies in suggests
 bronchitis or small airways disease, particularly in the setting of moderate
 hyperinflation.  Prominence of the right lower lobe vasculature is similar to
 multiple prior studies.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including
 severe cardiomegaly and a left pectoral dual-chamber pacemaker, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bronchial wall thickening suggesting bronchitis or small airways disease
 with associated hyperinflation.
 2. No focal consolidation.
 3. Unchanged severe cardiomegaly.
