                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection
 fraction, re-assessment of the patient after ICD placement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly is re-demonstrated, moderate, unchanged.  The upper distribution
 of the pulmonary vasculature is chronic and consistent with chronic congestive
 heart failure.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Minimal bibasal atelectasis is present.    Pacemaker device assessment
 demonstrates more superior than prior and superior than expected location of
 the atrial lead, currently projecting at the level of mid SVC and not
 positioned in the right atrium that might explain the abnormal reading on the
 pacemaker output and lack of the P wave. Right ventricle lead is in
 unremarkable position.
