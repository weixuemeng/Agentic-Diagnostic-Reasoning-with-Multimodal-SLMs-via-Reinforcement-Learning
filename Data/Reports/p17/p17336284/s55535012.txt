                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with syncope, hypoglycemia  // evaluate for
 infection, acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior chest radiograph, lung volumes have increased. 
 Streaky and linear bibasilar airspace opacities are again noted, similar to
 the prior examination.  Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is
 essentially unchanged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect
 atelectasis versus trace pleural effusion.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  A left pectoral pacemaker
 and its 3 leads are unchanged in position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, although
 superimposed infection is difficult to exclude.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.
