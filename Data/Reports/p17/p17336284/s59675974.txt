 AP and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged heart with a cardiac
 pacing device, its leads which appear in similar orientation relative to prior
 examination, noting that 1 lead is discontinuous.  Central vasculature appears
 engorged without over pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion.  Opacity
 within the medial aspect of the right lower lung zone with air bronchograms is
 somewhat more conspicuous relative to prior examination for which acute
 infectious process is difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is no air under the right hemidiaphragm.
