                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Asthma, CHF.  Dedicated AP and lateral views for evaluation of
 opacities.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 03:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the examination from ___ min prior, there has been no relevant
 change.  Lateral view demonstrates no correlate to the opacities seen on
 frontal view and these almost certainly represent perihilar opacities of
 edema.  While lateral view confirms no definite evidence of pneumonia, subtle
 infection cannot be excluded in the context of CHF in the appropriate clinical
 circumstance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 See above.
