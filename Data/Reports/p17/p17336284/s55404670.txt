                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Acute nocturnal dyspnea. History of asthma and CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and left anterior chest wall ICD and leads are
 unchanged. Mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta is unchanged. There is
 increase in the degree of pulmonary edema with blunting of the costophrenic
 angles consistent with in small bilateral pleural effusions. Opacification at
 the right base could represent an early atelectasis, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
  Increasing size of the cardiac silhouette with increased elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure. Right basilar opacification could reflect
 developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
