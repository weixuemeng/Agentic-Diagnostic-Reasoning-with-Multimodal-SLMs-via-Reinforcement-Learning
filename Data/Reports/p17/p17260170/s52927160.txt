 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia versus aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:30 this morning from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. 
 Moderate left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity are similar to the
 exam of 9:30 a.m.  The right lung is relatively clear.  Dual-chamber pacing
 leads project over the expected positions of the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  A right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter tip is in the
 right atrium.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  Cardiomegally is mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate right pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacity may
 represent pneumonia, atelectasis or other pulmonary process.
