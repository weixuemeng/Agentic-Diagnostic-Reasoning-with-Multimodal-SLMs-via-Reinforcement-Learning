                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Recent Dobbhoff placement.  Assess for position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiographs obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ timed at 7:59 a.m.  Current radiograph after this
 date is ___ timed at 13:07 a.m.
 
 REPORT:  Right-sided dialysis catheter, dual chamber pacemaker are in
 unchanged position.
 
 The Dobbhoff has advanced below the left hemidiaphragm, but is probably within
 the proximal stomach and could be advanced a little further.
 
 There is a left-sided effusion, atelectasis and possible pneumonia, unchanged.
 Patchy opacity in right mid zone also noted.  Probably mild persistent fluid
 overload.
