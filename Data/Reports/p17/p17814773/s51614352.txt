                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for 2 months, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are normal.  Right upper lobe nodularity and mild pleural
 thickening is again noted.  There may be associated bronchiectasis as well.
 
 No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation to indicate
 an acute process.  Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema. A tortuous and calcified aorta is again noted.
 Moderate to severe degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints are
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.  2. As before, chest CT is recommended on
 a nonemergent basis to evaluate the right upper lobe findings.
