                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There are slightly increased interstitial markings
 without evidence of frank edema or consolidation.  There is no effusion. 
 Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  Aortic valve replacement is
 noted as well as postoperative changes of median sternotomy.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are notable for hypertrophic changes in the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings in the lungs, which could be due
 to mild interstitial edema versus chronic underlying interstitial lung
 disease.
