                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The mediastinal clips, sternotomy
 wires and an aortic valve prosthesis are constant.
 
 Again, there is an increase in interstitial markings which may reflect
 underlying mild pulmonary edema or chronic lung disease.  The heart size is
 mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is
 no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: Increase in interstitial markings which may reflect underlying
 mild pulmonary edema or chronic lung disease.
