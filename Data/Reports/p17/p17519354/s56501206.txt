                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with bronchiectasis, worsening dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion with pulmonary vascular indistinctness.  Hilar
 are enlarged bilaterally, possibly due to underlying lymphadenopathy. Blunting
 of the costophrenic angles posteriorly bilaterally on the lateral biew
 suggests small pleural effusions.  Lungs are hyperinflated. Bibasilar
 bronchiectasis is demonstrated within bronchial wall thickening. Linear
 atelectasis is noted within the right upper lobe. No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Scarring within the right apex is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening suggestive of airway
 inflammation or infection. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bilateral hilar enlargement suggestive of
 underlying lymphadenopathy.
