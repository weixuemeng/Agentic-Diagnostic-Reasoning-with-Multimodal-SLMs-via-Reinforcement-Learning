                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, here to evaluate for pulmonary abnormality.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Mild streaky
 opacification at the left lung base is compatible with mild atelectasis.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.  A 1.4 x 1.1 cm radiopaque density projecting over
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may represent a large gallstone.  No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  1.4 x 1.1 cm density in the right upper quadrant may reflect a large
 gallstone.
