                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma, intubated, right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  The study is also compared to a chest CT scan done
 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube and left subclavian line are in adequate
 position and unchanged.  Unchanged right chest tube.  No pneumothorax. 
 Deterioration of alveolar and interstitial opacities bilaterally, compatible
 with moderate pulmonary edema.  Worsening of more round and well-defined
 density in the right perihilar region.  In the first CT scan, we saw a right
 perihilar contusion that got better in time : so this round density is less
 likely related to the trauma.  It could be a superimposed infection or
 aspiration.  The left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  Progression of the
 moderate pleural effusion bilaterally.
 
 OPINION:
 1.  Worsening of the moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Worsening of a round pulmonary density adjacent to the right hilum.  There
 was on the first exam, contusion at this location that got better in the
 subsequent exams, so it is less likely a process related to the trauma.  A
 superimposed infection or aspiration can be considered.
