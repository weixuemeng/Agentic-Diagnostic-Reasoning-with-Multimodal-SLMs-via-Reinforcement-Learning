                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post MVC with multiple pulmonary
 contusions.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from one day prior.
 
 Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian catheter are in
 satisfactory position.  Right apically directed chest tube is unchanged.  No
 definite pneumothorax is seen with patchy parenchymal pulmonary opacities
 likely reflective of evolving known contusions.  Moderate left basal
 atelectasis and effusion is worsened from the previous examination.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in retrocardiac atelectasis and accompanying
 effusion.
