                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right upper paramediastinal mass associated with a known goiter
 appears unchanged.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There are streaky opacities in both lower lungs,
 which are most suggestive of atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe opacities, although more suggestive of
 atelectasis than infection.  Stable abnormal bulging expansile right upper
 paramediastinal contour, known to reflect a goiter.
