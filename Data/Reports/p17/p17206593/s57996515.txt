 WET READ: ___ ___ 2:17 PM
  Increased soft tissue density in the anterior mediastinum  seen on lateral
  radiograph above the aortic arch, causing mass effect and posterior
  displacement of the trachea. This density is seen as a vague opacity in the
  left apex on frontal radiograph. Given no correlative finding on thyroid U/S,
  recommend non-urgent CT neck.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope, possible fever.  Evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The right basilar opacity/effusion on
 the most recent chest radiograph has resolved.  There is increased soft tissue
 density in the anterior mediastinum seen on lateral radiograph above the
 aortic arch, causing mass effect and posterior displacement of the trachea.
 This density is seen as a vague opacity in the left apex on frontal
 radiograph. It may have been present in ___ but is more conspicuous today.
 Given no correlative finding on thyroid U/S, recommend non-urgent CT neck. 
 
 The aorta is elongated and tortuous.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette reveals
 stable, mild cardiomegaly.  The hilar contours and pleural surfaces are
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Thoracic scoliosis and
 degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are redemonstrated. Surgical clips
 are in the abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Anterior mediastinal opacity more conspicuous since ___ without definite
 correlative finding on thyroid ultrasound. Recommend non-urgent CT neck for
 further evaluation.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
