  Right subclavian line terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. There is
  left greater than right lung base consolidation in association with low lung
  volumes and there is loss of the left hemidiaphragm. While this may be
  atelectatic, if there is concern for infection, a lateral may be helpful.
