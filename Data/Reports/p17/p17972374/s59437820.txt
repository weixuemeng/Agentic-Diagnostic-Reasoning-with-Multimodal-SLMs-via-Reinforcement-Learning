                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been previous median sternotomy, with disruption and
 displacement of multiple sternal wires, unchanged from the prior radiograph
 but most consistent with chronic sternal dehiscence.  Unchanged widening of
 cardiomediastinal contours likely reflects a combination of mild cardiomegaly
 and diffuse mediastinal lipomatosis.  Lungs are clear exceot fir focal linear
 scar versus atelectasis at the right lung base.  Unchanged blunting of right
 lateral costophrenic sulcus may reflect pleural thickening or pleural
 scarring.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and note is made of compression
 deformities in the imaged portion of the spine, not substantially changed
 since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings suggestive of chronic sternal dehiscence.
 
 2.  Right basilar pleural and parenchymal scarring, with or without coexisting
 small right pleural effusion.
