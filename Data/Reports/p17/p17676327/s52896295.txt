                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with ICH and intubated  // Eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AT 16:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of an endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately
 4 cm above level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level
 of the diaphragm, terminating in the proximal stomach, and could be advanced
 that it is well within the stomach. There are low lung volumes.  The
 mediastinum appears widened, also noted on the prior study although more
 conspicuous on the current study. Unclear whether this relates to differences
 in inspiration and technique, correlate with concern for mediastinal process.
 Clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CTA should be
 considered. Opacity at the left costophrenic angle may relate to overlying
 soft tissue although an underlying atelectasis or effusion not excluded. No
 pneumothorax is seen.
