                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due
 to the presence of mediastinal lipomatosis and low lung volumes. The aortic
 knob is calcified. Hilar contours are normal, and the pulmonary vasculature is
 unremarkable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 visualized. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to the presence of mediastinal
 lipomatosis and low lung volumes. Consider followup PA and lateral views with
 improved inspiratory effort for further assessment. No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality otherwise demonstrated.
