                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT  // NGT placement?      NGT placement?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Transesophageal drainage tube ends in the mid stomach.  ET tube in standard
 placement.  Moderately severe bibasilar consolidation is probably atelectasis
 since it has varied considerably over the past 3 days, more severe now than
 previously.
 
 Heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged. Severe widening of the mediastinum
 could ___ a variety of abnormalities including adenopathy and a dilated
 aorta, either aneurysm or dissection, but it could also be due to a
 combination of distended mediastinal veins and benign fat deposition.  If
 there is concern for active mediastinal condition, CT scanning with contrast
 is recommended, and if the aorta is suspect, with cardiac gating.
