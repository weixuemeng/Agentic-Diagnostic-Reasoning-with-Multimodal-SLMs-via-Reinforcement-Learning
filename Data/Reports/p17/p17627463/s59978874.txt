                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with known lung cancer, now with pneumonia and
 possible COPD exacerbation.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with stable rightward
 mediastinal shift. Tubular opacity projecting over the right hemithorax likely
 represents a structure extrinsic to the patient and severely limits assessment
 of the right lung.  Likely stable bibasilar opacities with a right
 juxtaphrenic peak suggesting stable right lower lobe volume loss.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely stable bibasilar opacities, but exam is severely limited by
 superimposition of external structures.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph for
 more optimal evaluation.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiograph without superimposed external
 structures for more optimal evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings and recommendations were communicated to Dr.
 ___ by Dr. ___ ___ text ___ on ___ at 12:30 PM, 10 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
