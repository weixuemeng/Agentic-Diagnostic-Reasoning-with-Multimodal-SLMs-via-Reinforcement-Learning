                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for comparison.  Reference
 made to PET-CT from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval increase in opacity projecting over the right hemi
 thorax, particularly involving the right mid to lower lung.  Findings may be
 due to large pneumonia and volume loss, worsening of malignant disease, with
 possible component of radiation.  Slight tenting of of the right hemidiaphragm
 suggests an element of volume loss.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Evidence of COPD is re- demonstrated.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in right pulmonary opacity the differential diagnosis
 including pneumonia with superimposed volume loss, worsening of malignant
 disease, possible component of radiation fibrosis, aspiration not excluded.
