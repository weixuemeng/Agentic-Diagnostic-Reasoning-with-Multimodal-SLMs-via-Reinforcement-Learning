                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ST elevation MI, assess for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph was obtained.  The lungs are
 well expanded with new retrocardiac consolidation and accompanying bilateral
 small pleural effusions.  Pulmonary edema if present is only seen at the
 bases.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe consolidation could conceivably reflect
 pneumonia in the appropriate setting or could be atelectasis.  Accompanying
 small bilateral pleural effusions and mild if any pulmonary edema at the
 bases.
