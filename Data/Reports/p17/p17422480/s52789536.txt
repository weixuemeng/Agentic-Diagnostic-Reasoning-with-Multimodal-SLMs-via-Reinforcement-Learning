                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and cough after recent hospitalization.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  New small right pleural effusion is present
 with minimal streaky right lower lobe opacity possibly reflecting atelectasis
 but infection is not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion is also noted. 
 Left lung is otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Scarring within the
 lung apices is re- demonstrated.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine, similar compared to the prior exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater left, with streaky right
 lower lobe opacity possibly reflecting atelectasis, but infection cannot be
 excluded.
