                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, which may be due to pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.  No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
