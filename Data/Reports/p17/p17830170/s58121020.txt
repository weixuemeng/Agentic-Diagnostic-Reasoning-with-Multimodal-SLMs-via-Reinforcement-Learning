                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable cardiomegaly and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion,
 and increasing interstitial edema.  Bilateral small pleural effusions have
 increased in size and are associated with worsening bibasilar lung opacities. 
 The latter may represent atelectasis and/or dependent edema, but aspiration
 should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
