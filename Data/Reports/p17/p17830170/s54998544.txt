 median sternotomy and CABG.  The heart size remains moderate to severely
 enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are new in the interval.  Additionally, a patchy opacity
 within the right lung base may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There are multilevel degenerative changes
 in the thoracic spine with anterior osteophyte formation.

 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Patchy right basilar opacity is nonspecific, possibly reflecting infection or
 atelectasis.  Left PICC terminates within the axillary region.
