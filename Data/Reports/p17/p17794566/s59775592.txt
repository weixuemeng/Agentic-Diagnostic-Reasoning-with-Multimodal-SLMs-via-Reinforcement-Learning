                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Headache, fever and chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The lungs appear clear aside from streaky left basilar opacity most likely to
 represent slight atelectasis.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacity most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  Short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered if
 pulmonary symptoms are present and the potential for developing pneumonia is a
 clinical concern, however.
