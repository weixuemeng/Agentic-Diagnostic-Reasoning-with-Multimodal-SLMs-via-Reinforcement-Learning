                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Aortic knob calcifications are again
 demonstrated.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is similar compared to the
 prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.  Bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  Assessment for pneumothorax is limited as the patient's chin and
 neck soft tissues obscure evaluation of the lung apices.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities visualized.  Marked degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint are partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, similar
 compared to the prior exam.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
