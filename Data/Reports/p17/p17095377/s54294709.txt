                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sepsis; recent small bowel enterotomy with
 leak.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endogastric tube tip terminates in the expected region of the
 stomach does not take a turn toward the pylorus.  No subdiaphragmatic free air
 is appreciated on this supine film.  The heart size is at the upper limits of
 normal.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic
 disease at the aortic knob.  Bilateral pulmonary hilar fullness is present as
 well as engorged pulmonary vasculature compatible with pulmonary edema that is
 similar to the previous day's radiograph but worsened from the earlier
 preoperative radiographs.  The lung volumes are low, and there is no large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax appreciated on this supine exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema, stable to prior but worsened since before her
 operation.
