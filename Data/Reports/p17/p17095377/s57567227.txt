                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued pulmonary
 edema with layering pleural effusion on the right.  Cardiac silhouette remains
 at the upper limits of normal in size or enlarged.  Retrocardiac opacification
 is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and a small pleural
 effusion.
 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed consolidation would have to
 be considered.
