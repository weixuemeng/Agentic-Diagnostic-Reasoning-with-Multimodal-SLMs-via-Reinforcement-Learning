                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There are low lung volumes that may account
 for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  Increased
 opacification with obscuration of the right heart border is seen.  This could
 well represent a middle lobe consolidation, though a lateral view would be
 necessary to confirm this if the condition of the patient permits.  The
 pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.  No definite
 pleural effusions.
