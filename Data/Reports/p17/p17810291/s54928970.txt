                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP upright AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain shortness of breath  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 A tiny clip projects over the right medial lung apex at the site of a
 spiculated lesion better assessed on prior PET-CT.  Lungs are otherwise clear
 without focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax.  Minimal left
 basal platelike atelectasis noted.  The lungs appear hyperinflated and
 hyperlucent which likely reflects underlying emphysema/ COPD. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with an unfolded mildly calcified
 thoracic aorta.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
