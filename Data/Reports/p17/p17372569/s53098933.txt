                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with increasing hypoxia, intubated and on ECMO.
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of
 view.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is likely positioned within the main pulmonary
 artery.  An inferior, likely femoral approach, ECMO venous cannula terminates
 within the distal superior vena cava rather than right atrium.  No definite
 arterial cannula is identified suggesting this is either ___ ___-___ ECMO
 technique or there is renal arterial ECMO access.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are not significantly changed compared to prior examination.  There
 is stable if not slightly worsened pulmonary edema compared to ___,
 not an unexpected finding.  However, there is a new   retrocardiac
 opacification which may be due to a combination of edema, atelectasis and new
 small left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned Swan-Ganz catheter and enteric catheter.
 Venous ECMO cannula appears to be positioned in the distal superior vena cava
 rather than right atrium.  Stable if not slightly increased pulmonary edema. 
 New retrocardiac opacification, likely combination of atelectasis, edema and
 new small left pleural effusion.  Please note a small hemothorax is a
 consideration given likely anticoagulant therapy or possibly ECMO-induced
 coagulopathy.
 
 ___ discussed these findings with Dr. ___ at 6:40 a.m. on
 ___ via telephone at time of interpretation.
