                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with recent CABG, now presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The lungs are clear.  No confluent
 opacities are identified.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are generally within normal limits. 
 Mediastinal clips and median sternotomy wires appear unchanged from prior but
 the lateral view shows a larger than usual postoperative retrosternal
 hematoma. It contains no gas and there is no accompanying pleural effusion to
 suggest infection. If the source of the chest pain does not become clear it is
 possible that an organizing hematoma is responsible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No obvious acute cardiopulmonary process. Retrosternal hematoma
 as unlikely cause of pain was discussed with Dr   ___ telephone at the time of
 dictation.
