                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recent left pneumonia and parapneumonic
 effusion, finished antibiotics 10 days ago.  Mild pleuritic left chest pain.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Previous left pleural effusion has resolved.  There is still a small region of
 consolidation in the left upper lobe, limited to the lingula, far smaller than
 when pneumonia was most advanced, on ___ involving all of the lingula
 and some of the anterior and posterior segments.  Nevertheless, because of
 concurrent symptoms, I would repeat a chest radiograph either if patient's
 clinical condition deteriorates or in three weeks.  Right lung is clear. 
 There is no evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size is normal.
