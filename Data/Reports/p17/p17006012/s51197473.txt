                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma and new palpitations and dyspnea.
 // Evaluate for cause of dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right indwelling catheter again seen, with tip near SVC/RA junction, possibly
 over the upper right atrium.  The tip appears retracted compared with the ___ radiograph.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Heart size at the upper limits of normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 otherwise within normal limits.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is
 identified.
 
 Incidental note is made of patchy density in the visualized portion of the
 left proximal humerus, extending beyond the edge of this film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 Mixed lucent sclerotic focus in the left proximal humerus, not fully
 evaluated.  Given location, this could represent an enchondroma or other
 chondroid lesion.  However, given the history of lymphoma, further
 characterization with dedicated left humerus radiographs is recommended.  Note
 is made that this lesion is visible on a FDG PET CT from ___, at
 which time no concerning uptake in this area was reported.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated left humerus radiographs to evaluate lesion in
 the left proximal humerus.
