                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___ or ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter remain in standard
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Multifocal
 areas of consolidation show interval further improvement, particularly in the
 right mid and lower lung region and may reflect a history of multifocal
 pneumonia.  More diffuse interstitial opacities have also improved and likely
 represent co-existing edema.  Bilateral pleural abnormalities are unchanged.
