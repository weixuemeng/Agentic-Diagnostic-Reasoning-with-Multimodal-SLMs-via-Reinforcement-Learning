                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R frontal bleed and fever.  // eval for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large pneumoperitoneum is re- demonstrated.
 
 The heart is enlarged but stable from multiple prior examinations.  There is
 minimal opacity at the base of the right lung.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax identified.  Of note, a skin fold over the left chest could be
 mistaken for a large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal opacity at the base of the right lung appears improved from ___ and likely reflects residual atelectasis.
 
 Persistent large pneumoperitoneum, likely related to recent gastrostomy tube
 placement.  Recommend evaluation of the gastrostomy for possible leak given
 the persistent large pneumoperitoneum.
