  Right basilar opacity, probably atelectasis.  Nodular opacity at left apex
  near an EKG lead, probably artifact, but suggest follow-up PA and lateral
  radiographs when appropriate to confirm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are streaky right basilar opacities, more
 suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  Minimal blunting at the left
 costophrenic sulcus is of uncertain significance, but differential
 considerations include a tiny pleural effusion versus scarring.  Projecting
 over the left lateral lung apex near an EKG lead is a small nodular focus of
 uncertain significance, less than 10 mm in size.  A subpleural scarring is
 noted at each lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy right basilar opacity, typical for atelectasis.  If pulmonary
 symptoms or present or persist, howver, short-term followup radiographs could
 be considered to re-evaluate the opacity, preferably with PA and lateral
 technique, if possible clinically.
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the left lung apex, near an EKG lead. 
 Although likely an artifact, it is difficult to exclude a true pulmonary
 nodule, and accordingly re-assessment with standard PA and lateral radiographs
 is recommended, following removal of the EKG leads, when clinically
 appropriate.
