                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia or intrathoracic process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There are no focal opacities to
 suggest pneumonia.  The heart is top normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  A conventional PA and lateral
 radiograph would be more revealing.
