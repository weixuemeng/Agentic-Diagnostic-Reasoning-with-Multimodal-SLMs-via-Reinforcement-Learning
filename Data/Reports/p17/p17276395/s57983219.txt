                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT performed on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Evaluation is difficult due to coinciding opacity associated
 with the port site, but there is patchy perihilar opacity in the same general
 vicinity, while elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity involving the right upper lobe, new since the remote prior
 study; this may represent an area of scarring or prior treatment site but
 pneumonia is not excluded.  If more recent prior radiographs are available
 done from ___, direct comparison may be helpful.
