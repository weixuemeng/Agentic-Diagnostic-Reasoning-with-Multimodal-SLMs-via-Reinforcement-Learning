 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 are widespread interstitial opacities with a perihilar predominance as well as
 small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is increased compared to
 the prior study from ___.  There is tortuosity of the descending
 thoracic aorta, unchanged.  Aortic calcifications are re-demonstrated.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Old right-sided rib fractures are again seen.  There is
 also chronic deformity of the distal right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions and mild increased cardiomegaly.
