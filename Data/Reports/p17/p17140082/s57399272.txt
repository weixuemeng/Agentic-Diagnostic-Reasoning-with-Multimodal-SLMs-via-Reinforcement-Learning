                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for changes in pleural effusions in patient status post
 aortic valve replacement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest depict stable postoperative
 appearance of the heart and mediastinum.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 persist, with possible minimal improvement in the left-sided effusion and left
 lower lobe atelectasis, although some of this change may be different
 positioning of the patient.  The lungs are otherwise clear and there is no
 pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal, without evidence of
 interstitial edema.  The sternotomy cerclage wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis, with some possible improvement on the left.
