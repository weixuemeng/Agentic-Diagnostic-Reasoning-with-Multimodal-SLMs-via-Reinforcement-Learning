 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 7:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip unchanged and in
 the right pulmonary outflow tract.  Endotracheal tube with tip at the thoracic
 inlet and nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  There are small layering bilateral effusions with associated
 patchy opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours
 in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy for CABG.   No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
