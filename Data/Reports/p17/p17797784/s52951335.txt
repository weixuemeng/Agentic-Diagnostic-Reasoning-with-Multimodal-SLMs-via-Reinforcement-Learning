                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mild chest pain and shortness of breath, history
 of breast cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  Calcification in the
 aortic knob is noted.  Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are
 well expanded without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  A 1.0 cm
 round opacity projects at the lung base posteriorly, best seen on the lateral
 view.  This is not definitively identified on the frontal view but may be
 present at the left lung base.  The upper abdomen is unremarkable. Surgical
 clips are noted projecting over the breast tissue on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Apparent round opacity projecting over the posterior lung bases on the
 lateral view.  Chest CT is recommended when clinically appropriate.
