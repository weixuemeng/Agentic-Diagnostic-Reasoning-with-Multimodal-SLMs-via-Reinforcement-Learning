                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior study is available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased.  There is blunting at
 the left costophrenic angle with hazy opacity at the left lung base, likely
 reflecting a combination pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, although
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context.
 The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is normal
 in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
