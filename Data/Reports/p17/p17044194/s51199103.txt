                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with renal transplant, here with multifocal
 pneumonia. Dyspnea minimally improving  // worsening infiltrates?    
 worsening infiltrates?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Multifocal opacities an on the
 previous study appear to be more homogeneous but involving substantially
 larger parts of the lungs in particular in the lower lobes.  That might
 represent evolution of the process and potentially combination of infection
 with organizing pneumonia.  No pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  Correlation with chest CT would be justified in this patient with
 history of renal transplantation and multifocal infection to exclude
 possibility of opportunistic infection or interstitial abnormality of non
 infectious origin.
