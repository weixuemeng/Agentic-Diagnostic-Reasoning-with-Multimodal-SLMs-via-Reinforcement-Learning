 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain and right breast mass
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward shift of mediastinal
 structures and apparent surgical material in the left hilar region suggests
 prior pneumonectomy.  A left-sided PICC is demonstrated with tip likely in the
 region of the mid SVC. The right lung appears hyperinflated but clear. No
 pulmonary edema is present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion on
 the right. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacification of the left hemothorax likely due to prior pneumonectomy. 
 Correlation with clinical history is recommended as well as previous imaging
 exams.
