                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M POD___ s/p AVR, rising lactate  // eval interval change     
 eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18:52
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest on ___ at 03:49 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the right
 pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3
 cm above the carina. A right basilar chest tube remains in place along with
 the mediastinal drains.
 
 Status post median sternotomy with stably widened cardiac and mediastinal
 contours in this recently postoperative patient. Layering left effusion with
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  The mild
 interstitial edema is improving, although there is still likely a component of
 mild perihilar edema.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
