                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A central venous catheter has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases, greater on
 the left than right, with mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm,
 appear unchanged and suggest atelectasis.  Lungs appear otherwise clear.
 Fissures are again minimally thickened. A small pleural effusion has probably
 resolved on the left side at least for the most part.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decrease in small left pleural effusion; otherwise unchanged.
