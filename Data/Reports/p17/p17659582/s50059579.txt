                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion  // please evaluate for
 infectious process, fluid overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart remains moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 Previously noted areas of parenchymal opacification in the right perihilar and
 left suprahilar regions have resolved.  There is no definite pulmonary edema. 
 There are moderate pleural effusions along with bibasilar airspace opacities,
 likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  Right perihilar airspace opacity could reflect an area of pneumonia.
 There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right perihilar opacity is concerning for pneumonia in the correct
 clinical setting.
 2.  Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar airspace
 opacities, likely atelectasis, though infection is not excluded.
 3.  No pulmonary edema.
