                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Asthma, fever, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Compared to the prior study,
 pulmonary edema has significantly improved with decreased azygous distention
 and vascular engorgement. Bibasilar opacities concerning for atelectasis
 and/or pneumonia persist.  There is probably small left pleural effusion. 
 Peribronchial cuffing is again noted.  The upper lung zones are clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is obscured by low lung volumes and
 bibasilar opacities.
