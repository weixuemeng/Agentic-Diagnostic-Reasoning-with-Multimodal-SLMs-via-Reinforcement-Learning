                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema.  A more confluent
 opacity in the right lower lobe has slightly improved, and shows more marked
 improvement when compared to and earlier chest x-___ ___ ___.  This
 could potentially represent a resolving area of asymmetrical edema, but other
 processes such as pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Small right pleural effusion is also noted and has improved
 since earlier radiographs as well.  Large lung volumes suggest underlying COPD
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
