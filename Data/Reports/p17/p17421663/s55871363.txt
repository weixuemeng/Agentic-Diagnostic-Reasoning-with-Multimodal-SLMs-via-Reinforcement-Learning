                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right lower lobe
 infiltrate.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 a day before.
 
 There is interval decrease in the right mid and lower lung opacity which is
 substantially significant even now.  The patient is in mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen, but pleural effusion is
 most likely present.  The left central venous line tip is at the level of
 superior SVC.
