                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intubated.  Study
 requested for evaluation of ETT and infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm and terminates at the upper stomach.  Left PICC
 line terminates at the mid SVC. Hyperexpanded lungs suggest underlying COPD. 
 Persistent retrocardiac opacity is consistent with left lower lung collapse
 and probable layering effusion.  There is a small residual pleural effusion on
 the right, if any.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent retrocardiac opacity, likely related to left lower
 lobe collapse with layering pleural effusion.
 
 These findings were discussed with ___, NP by Dr. ___ via telephone
 on ___ at 3:52 p.m.
