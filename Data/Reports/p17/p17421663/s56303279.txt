                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, intubated for anaphylactic shock,
 evaluate for placement of ETT.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-erect position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day.  The previously observed
 bilateral extensive scattered and somewhat confluenting parenchymal
 infiltrates persist and may have even increased slightly, now involving the
 left lower lobe area as well.  During the latest examination interval, the
 patient has been intubated, the ETT seen to terminate in the trachea 8 cm
 above the level of the carina.  This is a rather unusual high position but may
 be otherwise acceptable.  Referring physician  was paged at 4:30 p.m.
