 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube, Dobbhoff
 feeding tube, left approach PICC are in unchanged standard position.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Overall aeration of the lungs has significantly improved
 compared to prior examination from 6 hours prior.  Given rapid clearing of
 diffuse opacities, findings are consistent with pulmonary edema.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions persist.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Rapid clearing of diffuse opacities, findings consistent with improving
 pulmonary edema.
