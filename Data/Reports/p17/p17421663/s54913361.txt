                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Flash pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of
 the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  Some engorgement of
 indistinct pulmonary vessels is consistent with some residual elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Hazy opacification at the right base raises the
 possibility of some pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, a
 right basilar consolidation would have to be considered.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
