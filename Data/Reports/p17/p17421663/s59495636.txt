                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  Pulmonary vascularity
 appears engorged, and is accompanied by worsening diffuse bilateral airspace
 opacities, now involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left, and
 accompanied by peripheral septal lines.  Although the observed findings may
 reflect worsening pulmonary edema, the relatively lobar distribution of
 opacification in the right upper lobe raises the concern for concurrent
 pneumonia in this region.  Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful
 to better distinguish foci of edema from infection.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion is also demonstrated.
