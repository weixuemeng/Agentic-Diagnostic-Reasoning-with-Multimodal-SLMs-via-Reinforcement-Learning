                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Rapid
 worsening of predominantly perihilar and basilar airspace opacities as well as
 more widespread peripherally predominant interstitial opacities.  The
 distribution and rapid time course favor pulmonary edema, but followup
 radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to ensure resolution and to
 exclude other co-existing process.  Bilateral small partially layering pleural
 effusions are also noted.
