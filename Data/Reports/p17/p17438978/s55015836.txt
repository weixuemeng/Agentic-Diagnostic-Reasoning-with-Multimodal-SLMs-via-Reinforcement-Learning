  1. Improved aeration compared with the recent prior study with persistent low
  lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis.
  2. Left lower lung opacity likely represents atelectasis, superimposed
  consolidation is not excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cocaine use, fever, cough, abdominal pain,
 diarrhea  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 03:45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild diffuse interstitial opacities could represent crack lung.  Left basal
 curvilinear opacity could be due to infection.  No pulmonary vascular
 congestion or edema.  There is moderate bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no
 effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild diffuse interstitial opacities could represent crack lung.
 2. Left basal curvilinear opacity could be due to infection.
