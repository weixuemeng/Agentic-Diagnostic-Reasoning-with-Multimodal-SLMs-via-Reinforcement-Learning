                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Cough, fever, leukocytosis, suspected pneumonia.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated, unchanged.  Lungs are
 essentially clear except for right apical nodule most likely calcification. 
 Additional pulmonary nodules suspected on the prior radiograph are not clearly
 seen on the current study besides questionable nodule in the left lower lobe. 
 Giving still present suspicious pulmonary nodules, a re-evaluation of the
 patient with chest CT is recommended.
