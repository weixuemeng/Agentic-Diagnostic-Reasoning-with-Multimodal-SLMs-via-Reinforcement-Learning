                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  pre-MRI  // pre-MRI **please make sure there are no overlying
 objects on patient's chest before performing CXR**
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple MR screening radiographs from ___ at 05:38 and
 chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.9 cm above the carina.  There are
 low inspiratory volumes.  There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and minimal atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  No pneumothorax, overt CHF, or gross effusion
 identified.
 
 A spring overlying the left upper zone is thought to lie outside the the
 patient.
 
 There is a small slightly curvilinear density, likely metallic, measuring
 approximately 3.6 mm, which overlies the left mid chest slightly lateral to
 the heart border.  In addition, it overlies the left first anterior rib.  This
 likely corresponds the small density identified on the MR pre screening study.
 The the patient position is change between the 2 studies, more LPO  on the
 prior study and very slightly RPO on the current study.  The small metallic
 density overlay the heart on the prior study and now overlies the lung,
 separate from the heart.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube in place, 4.9 cm above the carina.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study.
 3. Tiny metallic density is again seen, suggesting it lies within the the
 patient.  It shows change in position with change in the patient position, but
 its location is not fully characterized on the basis of this.  It is new
 compared with ___.
