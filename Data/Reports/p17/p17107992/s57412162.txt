                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and dyspnea.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  There is a consolidative opacity in
 the right lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia.  A patchy opacity is seen in
 the retrocardiac area which likely represents scarring or atelectasis, but
 could also represent a second site of pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is slightly enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.  Cholecystectomy clips are
 noted in the right upper abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is either
 atelectasis or a second site of infection.  Follow up radiographs are
 recommended after treatment to ensure resolution of this finding.
