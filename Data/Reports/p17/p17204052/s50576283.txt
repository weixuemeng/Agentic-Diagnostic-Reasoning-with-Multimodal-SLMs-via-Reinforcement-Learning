 white count.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___, chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 Right apical fibrosis and paramediastinal fibrosis is unchanged from prior
 examination, compatible with post-radiative changes.  The lungs are otherwise
 clear without new opacity.  Likely small chronic pleural effusion.  Pleural
 spaces are otherwise clear without pneumothorax.  Old multiple right sided rib
 deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Stable paramediastinal
 fibrosis.
