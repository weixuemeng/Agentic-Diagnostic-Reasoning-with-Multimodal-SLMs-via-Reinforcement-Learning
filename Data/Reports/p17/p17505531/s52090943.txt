                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for
 low lung volumes.  Aorta is markedly calcified and slightly tortuous.  Linear
 opacities at the bases may reflect focal scarring or linear atelectasis. 
 There are no confluent areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of
 pneumonia.
