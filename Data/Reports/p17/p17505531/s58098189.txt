                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New oxygen requirement, to assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite
 vascular congestion.  Areas of increased opacification at the bases suggest
 atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would
 be difficult to exclude.
