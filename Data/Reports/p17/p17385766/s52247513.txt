                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  On this repeat study, there is some opacification at the left base
 that could reflect some pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.  In view of the
 size of the patient, this could merely be a manifestation of scattered
 radiation.
