                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ETT and pul edema pls eval placement  //
 History: ___F with ETT and pul edema pls eval placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the level of the
 carina.  There is severe pulmonary emphysema.  More confluent opacity in the
 right mid to lower lung most likely relates to pulmonary edema although
 infectious process or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  The costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by supine,
 AP technique.  Aortic knob calcification is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the level of the
 carina.
 
 Severe pulmonary edema.
