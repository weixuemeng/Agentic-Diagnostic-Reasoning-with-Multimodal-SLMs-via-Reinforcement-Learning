                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Wheezing.  Evaluate for congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate continued
 opacification at the left lung base which appears to be atelectatic as no
 pleural effusion is seen in the lateral view. The study is however limited due
 to technique and should be repeated.  The remainder of the left lung field as
 well as the right lung is clear.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, not acutely.
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The lung volumes are decreased compared
 to the prior study, accentuating the cardiac contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Poor quality image. No definite pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Recommend repeat study.
