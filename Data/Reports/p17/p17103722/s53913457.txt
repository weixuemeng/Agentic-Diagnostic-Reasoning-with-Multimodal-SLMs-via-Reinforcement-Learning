 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and chest CT scanning ___.

 size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, already augmented by large
 collection of mediastinal fat.  There is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema and
 probably no pleural effusion.  A dual channel left jugular dialysis catheter
 ends in the right atrium.
 
 The LPO positioning of the frontal projection affords a good view of right
 lung lesions ascribed to bronchial impactions on the chest CT ___. If
 the patient's clinical situation permits, it would be reasonable to repeat
 chest CT scanning to confirm the interpretation.
