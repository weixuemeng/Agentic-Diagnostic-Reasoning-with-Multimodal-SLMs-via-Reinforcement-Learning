 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial obliquity
 of the patient limiting detail.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion.  Opacification at the left
 base suggests volume loss left lower lobe and pleural fluid.  Dense streaks of
 atelectasis are seen at several levels in the left hemithorax.  Central
 catheter remains in place.
 As on the previous study, areas of opacification are seen in the right mid to
 upper zone, consistent with bronchial impaction seen on previous CT scan.
