                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes type 2, atrial
 fibrillation, on Coumadin, complicated history of access-related procedures
 with persistent MRSA bacteremia, line placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW No previous chest x-ray on PACS record for
 comparison.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 Rotated positioning.  A left sided dual-lumen catheter is present.  The lead
 tips most likely overlie the distalmost SVC near the RA junction and the upper
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax is detected.  This catheter was present at the
 time of the ___ CT scan.  
 
 Allowing for marked rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent,
 but probably unchanged.  Possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but no
 overt CHF.  
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm and of the costophrenic angle.  This may very well be an
 artifact due to overlying soft tissues and underpenetrationm as well as a
 prominent fat pad seen on the ___ CT.  If there is high concern for a
 left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate, then a lateral view could help for
 further assessment.  
 
 Right lung is grossly clear, without CHF, focal consolidation or effusion. 
 Minimal atelectasis at the right base.
 
 Irregular opacities over the left upper lung are thought to relate to the
 calcified cartilaginous portion of the first rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm,
 which may relate to overlying soft tissues and mediastinal fat pad.  If there
 is high concern for a left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate, then a lateral
 view could help for further assessment.
 
 2.  Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
 
 3.  Cardiomegaly and left-sided catheter again noted.
