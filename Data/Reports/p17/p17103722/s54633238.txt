                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man ESRD s/p RUE AVG revision.  // ___ balloon
 passed through graft, pulled out without visualization of balloon on tip. Eval
 for ? retained foreign body.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is marked leftward rotation of the patient. In comparison to prior
 radiograph there are low lung volumes and a poor inspiratory effort.
 
 Again seen in stable position is a left-sided tunneled hemodialysis catheter
 with distal tip projecting over the approximate location of the right atrium. 
 There are no retained foreign bodies seen.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly unchanged.  The bilateral hila
 are not well visualized.
 
 Allowing for differences in inspiratory effort, the bilateral lung parenchyma
 are grossly unchanged in comparison to prior radiograph. There is continued
 retrocardiac opacification and obscuring of the left hemidiaphragm, which may
 represent left lower lobe atelectasis.  There are several foci of
 opacification seen in the right upper lung which correlate to the areas of
 mucoid impaction and adjacent ground glass opacities noted on prior chest CT
 from ___.  These appear unchanged in comparison to prior
 radiograph.
 
 There is no pneumothorax. There is no right effusion. The left lateral CP
 angle is not visualized on the current study which limits evaluation for left
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. No foreign body seen.
 2. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
 3. Right upper lobe opacities which correspond to prior areas of mucoid
 impaction better appreciated on CT from ___, unchanged since prior
 radiograph.
