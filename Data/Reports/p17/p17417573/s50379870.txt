                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 21:18
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:23.
 
 Portable AP of chest from ___ and 9:19 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line continues at its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube does not appear to be changed in
 position with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach
 although the sideport may be near the gastroesophageal junction.  Clinical
 correlation is advised. Interval appearance of streaky, patchy bibasilar and
 left mid lung opacities likely reflecting areas of atelectasis in the setting
 of diminished lung volumes. No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and medistinal
 contours are stable.
