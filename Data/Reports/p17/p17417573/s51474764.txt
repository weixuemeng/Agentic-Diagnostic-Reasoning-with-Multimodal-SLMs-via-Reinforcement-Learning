                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:28 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metabolic syndrome and acute pancreatitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lungs are low in volume, and the upper lungs are clear.  The right lung base
 medially might be seen dilated vasculature, but the area should be reevaluated
 with conventional radiographs when feasible.  Heart size is normal. 
 Mediastinal contour is not, with tubulation, greater on the left than the
 right.  However, given the extent of extrapleural fat deposition, this could
 be due to fat as well.  Any prior chest radiograph should be obtained to see
 whether this is a chronic or a new finding warranting further investigation. 
 Extensive extrapleural fat should not be mistaken for pleural abnormality.
