                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AVR, MV repair  // follow up
 edema/effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14 43
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present.  Level of the ETT tip is difficult to determine given
 obscuration by spinal fixation hardware.  The tube cannot be traced beyond
 level of the thoracic inlet on this film.
 
  NG tube present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 
 Left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter present, tip overlying the pulmonary outflow tract.
 
 Bilateral chest tubes.  No pneumothorax detected.  Mediastinal drains are
 likely present.
 
 Note made of prosthetic valves, unchanged.
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  Again seen is diffuse opacity in both lungs and dense
 retrocardiac opacity with obscuration left hemidiaphragm.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is also not well delineated.  Small pleural effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Background scoliosis noted, not fully evaluated.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Exact position of the ET tube is difficult to determine due to obscuration by
 overlying hardware.  ET tube cannot be traced beyond level of the thoracic
 inlet, but its exact position is not conclusively determined on this film.  If
 clinically indicated, oblique or lateral views, which would project the spinal
 hardware way from the mediastinum/trachea, could help for further evaluation
 of the ET tube position.
 
 CHF, with vascular blurring and scattered foci of alveolar edema.  This is
 probably slightly worse compared with ___.
 
 Bibasilar opacity, consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. 
 At the left lung base, this is unchanged.  At the right lung base, this is
 more pronounced compared with 2 days prior.
 
 Possibility of small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
