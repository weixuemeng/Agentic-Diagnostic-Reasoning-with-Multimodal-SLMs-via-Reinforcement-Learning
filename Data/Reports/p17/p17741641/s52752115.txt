                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with generalized pruritis. Evaluate for
 mediastinal LAD.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs or thoracic imaging are available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded and clear.  No focal consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and pleura are normal.  An opacity in the right suprahilar region most likely
 represents a combination of superimposed normal structures including the ribs
 and pulmonary vasculature, as no corresponding abnormality is seen on the
 lateral view.  However lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right supra-hilar opacity seen only on the frontal view, likely superimposed
 normal structures, but in the current clinical setting, lymphadenopathy cannot
 be excluded.  If prior chest radiographs are available, these would be helpful
 to assess stability.  Otherwise, repeat chest radiograph could be obtained.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression above was entered by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 14:31 into the Department of Radiology critical communications
 system for direct communication to the referring provider.
