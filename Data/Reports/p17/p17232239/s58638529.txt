                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain sob cough, fever?  // r/o pna
 r/o estrangulated hernia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the right and there are low lung volumes, making
 evaluation suboptimal.  There is widening of the mediastinum which may be due
 to a markedly unfolded aorta however, aortic dilatation or underlying
 mediastinal adenopathy is not excluded.  The heart is likely enlarged.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities, right greater than left could be due to multifocal
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution and comparison with priors if
 available.  No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There chronic deformities of both shoulders with fluid appear
 to be chronic dislocations.  There is flattening of the superior right humeral
 head and there may be underlying osteonecrosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suboptimal study due to patient rotation and low lung volumes.  Widening of
 the mediastinum may be due to a markedly unfolded aorta, however, aortic
 dilatation or underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not excluded.  The
 heart is likely enlarged.
 
 Right greater than left bibasilar opacities may be due to pneumonia and/or
 aspiration.
 
 Chronic deformities of both shoulders, including bilateral shoulder
 dislocations.  Flattening and sclerosis of the superior right humeral head,
 osteonecrosis may be present.
