 and calcification along the aorta.  Basilar opacities in the medial left lung
 base are probably associated with a hiatal hernia, not significantly changed
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The bones appear
 demineralized.  Moderate degenerative changes are similar along the mid lumbar
 spine.
