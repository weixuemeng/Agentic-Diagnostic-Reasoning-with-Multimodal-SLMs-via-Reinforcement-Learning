                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are markedly low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is borderline enlarged. Crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion is seen. Assessment of the left apex is limited as the patient's chin
 and neck obscure this region. No right pneumothorax is seen. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient positioning.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis. No gross intrathoracic abnormality otherwise demonstrated however
 assessment of the left apex is markedly limited.
