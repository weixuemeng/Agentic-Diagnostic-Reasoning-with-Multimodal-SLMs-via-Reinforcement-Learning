                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mechanical fall, on Coumadin.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained with a total of
 three exposures.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There is
 increased pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The aortic arch is calcified and tortuous.  Additionally, there are aortic
 valve and coronary artery calcifications.  The cardiac silhouette is severely
 enlarged.  Allowing for changes in lung volumes, there is no significant
 change.  The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.  The bones are severely
 osteopenic, limiting evaluation.  In a lower thoracic vertebral body, there be
 a slight increase in loss of anterior vertebral body height, which is likely
 degenerative.  No acute fracture is identified.  
  
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild pulmonary edema.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 3.  No evidence of fracture on this limited exam.
