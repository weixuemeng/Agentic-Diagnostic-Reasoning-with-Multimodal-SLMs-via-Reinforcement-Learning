                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar linear opacities are most likely due to atelectasis.
 Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications
 noted at the arch.  There is no large effusion.  Thickening of the minor and
 one of the two major fissures seen on the lateral view may be due to
 thickening or fluid in the fissure.  Osseous structures are not well evaluated
 due to osteopenia.  Degenerative changes seen at the left shoulder.
