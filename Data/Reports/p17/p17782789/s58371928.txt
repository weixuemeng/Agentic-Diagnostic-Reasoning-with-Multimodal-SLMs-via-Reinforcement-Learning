 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall, question infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is peribronchial airspace opacity within the right middle
 lobe, which appears chronic.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably
 present.  There is moderate cardiomegaly, and calcification of the aortic
 knob.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is again noted and may reflect chronic
 mild fluid overload.

 small bilateral effusions.
