                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, stable.  The aorta remains
 calcified and tortuous.  There are areas in the mid to lower lungs bilaterally
 of linear atelectases.  There is a background of coarse reticular interstitial
 lines grossly stable to the prior study.  Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity is
 stable, could relate to chronic atelectasis/scarring, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting, an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
