                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cholecystitis.  Pre-operative chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  No prior.  Low lung volumes are
 seen.  There is increased density projecting over the first right anterior
 costochondral cartilage.  This could be potentially due to degenerative
 changes; however, given asymmetry, two-view chest x-ray suggested when patient
 is amenable.  Otherwise, lungs are grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are
 unremarkable.  No free air is seen below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Nodular density projecting
 over the right first costochondral cartilage area, potentially degenerative;
 however, two-view chest x-ray recommended on a nonurgent basis to exclude
 underlying lung lesion.  
 
 Findings were communicated to scrub nurse in the O.R. with Dr. ___ at 2:45
 p.m. on ___.
