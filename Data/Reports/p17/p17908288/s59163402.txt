                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild to moderate right pleural effusion appears increased since the prior
 study.  Right base opacity is likely due to pleural effusion and atelectasis
 although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  There may be minimal
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is minor
 biapical pleural thickening.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right pleural effusion, which appears mildly increased compared to the prior
 study.  Right basilar opacity likely represents combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not excluded. 
 Possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
