                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea for 2 weeks.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  A
 small left pleural effusion is likely also present.  Underlying basilar
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  There is minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The cardiac silhouette appears likely mildly enlarged, although
 the right aspect of it is not well assessed due to the right basilar opacity. 
 The aorta is calcified.  There are compression deformities of multiple
 vertebral bodies involving the lower thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine, of
 indeterminate age.  Correlate clinically for acuity.
