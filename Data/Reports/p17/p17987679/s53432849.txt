                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  HFpEF and atrophic relation, now with confusion.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a pacemaker with the leads
 overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  Coarsened lung markings may reflect chronic lung disease. No focal
 consolidation is identified.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Calcification of the thoracic aorta is again seen.  A wedge compression
 deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
