 HISTORY:  History of AFib, hypertension, syncope, breast cancer, now with
 altered mental status.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___
 and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Dual lead left sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is a small left pleural effusion with
 overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation can not be excluded.  The
 trace right pleural effusion is similar compared from prior exam.  A hazy
 opacity in the right lung base may be due to aspiration or infection.  Mild
 cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings suggest
 mild pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior
 exam.  There is no pneumothorax.
