 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p tracheoplasty.  Evaluate for interval

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Atelectasis in the right mid lung with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 overall unchanged.  Opacity with adjacent lucency in the right midlung is in
 the minor fissure and may represent loculated air and fluid in the fissure. 
 The left lung is clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Mild bilateral apical pleural thickening is unchanged.  Right
 lower lateral pleural thickening is also probably overall unchanged.  The
 heart size is normal.  The thoracic aorta vessel mildly tortuous or ectatic. 
 The hila are within normal limits.  Anterior cervical spine fixation plate and
 screws grossly appear intact and unchanged in position.  Mild multilevel
 degenerative changes in the visualized thoracic spine are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Persistent right midline atelectasis and
 postoperative small amount of loculated air and fluid in the right minor
 fissure.
