                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with tracheobronchomalacia, now s/p
 tracheobronchoplasty  // ___F s/p tracheobronchoplasty, chest tube x1, pls
 perform postop CXR
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent dated
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right lung volume is low compared to the left side.
 
 There are new and linear opacities in the right lower lobe, likely atelectasis
 versus consolidation.  Aspiration pneumonitis is also a consideration.
 
 There is diffuse prominence of interstitial markings as well as vascular
 prominence.
 
 The right main bronchus is not clearly visualized and there is deviation of
 the distal trachea to the left side.  This may reflect presence of a hematoma
 in this region related to the recent surgery.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly and widening of the superior mediastinum.
 
 Epidural catheter is seen in place.  Metallic hardware projects over the lower
 cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 Diffuse vascular prominence, increase in interstitial markings and
 cardiomegaly likely reflects presence of associated pulmonary edema.
 
 Widening of superior mediastinum with extrinsic compression over the distal
 trachea which is deviated to the left-side and nonvisualization of the right
 main bronchus, likely secondary to postsurgical edema.
