  The right chest tube has been removed.  The right apex is slightly obscured by
  overlying soft tissue but no large pneumothorax is identified.  There is some
  subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, new since prior study.  Right middle lobe
  and bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis, however developing
  infection cannot be excluded.  Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right chest tube removed at 3:00 PM  //
 Please evaluate interval change and rule out pneumothorax.  Please perform
 study at 7:00 PM.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided chest tube has been removed.  There is again seen areas of
 consolidation at the lung bases, right greater than left.  This likely
 represents atelectasis however underlying infection would be difficult to
 exclude.  Small bilateral effusions are seen.  There is mild improvement of
 the pulmonary interstitial edema since the previous study.  No pneumothoraces
 are seen.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the right neck soft tissues.
