                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with compensated sCHF, persistent cough s/p
 fixation of left distal femur.  // Please evaluate for pneumonia.     Please
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 17:11
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is stable blunting of the left costophrenic angle with minimal
 associated patchy opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Streaky opacities in
 the right lung base also likely reflect atelectasis or scarring. No evidence
 of pulmonary edema. No new airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Heart
 remains stably enlarged. Aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerosis. 
 No pneumothorax. Lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated which may reflect
 underlying emphysema.
