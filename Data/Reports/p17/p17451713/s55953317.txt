 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 4:22 PM
  
  Hyperinflated lungs consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
  
  Focal opacity projecting over the anterior right third rib that was not seen
  on the prior studies. While may relate to the anterior rib, a pulmonary lesion
  is not excluded.
  
  Recommend shallow oblique radiographs or nonurgent chest CT to further assess
  opacity at the anterior right third rib.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with Failure to thrive in the setting of pyschotic
 depression  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors including ___, ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs remain hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  Projecting over the anterior right third rib, there is a focal
 opacity that was not seen on the prior studies.  While this may relate to the
 anterior rib, the pulmonary lesion is not excluded.  Consider shallow oblique
 radiographs or nonurgent chest CT for further assessment.  No focal
 consolidation or large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is persistent
 biapical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflated lungs consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 
 Focal opacity projecting over the anterior right third rib that was not seen
 on the prior studies.  While may relate to the anterior rib, a pulmonary
 lesion is not excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Shallow oblique radiographs or nonurgent chest CT to
 further assess opacity at the anterior right third rib.
