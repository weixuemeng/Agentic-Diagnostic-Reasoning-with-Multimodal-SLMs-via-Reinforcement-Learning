 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute hypotension, evaluation of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:30 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carina.  The
 patient has received a new right internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip
 projects over the low SVC.  There is no evidence of complication, notably no
 pneumothorax.  The lung volumes remain low with atelectasis at both lung bases
 and some tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural
 effusions.  No overt pulmonary edema.
