                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Heart size is top normal, unchanged.  Mild
 atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the aortic knob.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Apart from subsegmental atelectasis in the lingula,
 the lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view
 may suggest the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible trace bilateral pleural effusions and lingular subsegmental
 atelectasis.
