                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with substernal chest pain.  Is there
 pneumothorax, rib fracture or infection?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion or pulmonary contusion.  Mild pectus deformity of the lower sternum
 is clinically insignificant.  I see no displaced rib fracture, but it should
 be noted that the conventional chest radiograph is not ideal for detecting
 chest cage trauma.  Any regions of focal tenderness should be marked for
 detailed bone views.
