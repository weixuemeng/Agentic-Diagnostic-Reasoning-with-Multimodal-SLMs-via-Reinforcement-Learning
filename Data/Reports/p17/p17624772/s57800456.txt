  Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the left upper and lower lobes as well
  as possibly over the right upper lung are nonspecific and not well assessed on
  this study.  No prior available for comparison. Recommend comparison with
  prior radiographs, if available, if not, chest CT for further evaluation for
  underlying pulmonary nodule.
  
  No definite focal consolidation.  No radiographic evidence of hilar or
  mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with extended low grade fevers, lymphadenopathy.  //
 pna, lymphadenopathy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Subtle nodular opacities projecting over the bilateral upper lung, along the
 anterior right second rib and on the left between the anterior left
 second-third ribs spaces are nonspecific.  No prior study available for
 comparison.  There is also subtle nodular opacity at the left lung base which
 could relate to atelectasis.  No discrete focal consolidation is seen.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.  No radiographic evidence of hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the left upper and lower lobes as well
 as possibly over the right upper lung are nonspecific and not well assessed on
 this study.  No prior available for comparison.  Recommend comparison with
 prior radiographs, if available, if not, chest CT for further evaluation for
 underlying pulmonary nodule.
 
 No definite focal consolidation.  No radiographic evidence of hilar or
 mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend comparison with prior radiographs, if available,
 if not, chest CT for further evaluation for underlying pulmonary nodule.
