                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post kidney transplant POD 1 with shortness of breath.  Rule
 out pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is
 redemonstration of a small left pleural effusion with atelectasis of the left
 lung base.  There is increased opacity at the right lung base, which may
 reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid.  However an early
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are noted at
 the right upper quadrant and a vascular stent projects over the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter
 terminates in the mid SVC.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased right lung base opacity, which could reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural fluid, however an early infectious process cannot be
 excluded and short-term followup is recommended. 
 
 2.  Stable small left-sided pleural effusion with atelectasis of the left lung
 base.
