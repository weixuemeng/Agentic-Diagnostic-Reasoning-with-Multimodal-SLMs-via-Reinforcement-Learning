                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease and worsening
 shortness of breath and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a stent within the left brachiocephalic vein, as before. 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a
 moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with a small one on the right side,
 very similar to prior findings.  Associated atelectatic changes are likely in
 the corresponding lower lobes and possibly lingula on the left, but there is
 balanced mass effect and lung fields appear otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than
 right.
