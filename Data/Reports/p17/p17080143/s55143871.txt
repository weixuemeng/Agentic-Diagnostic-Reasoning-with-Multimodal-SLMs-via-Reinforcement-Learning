                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease and mitral regurgitation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Current study demonstrates stent most likely in the left brachiocephalic vein.
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including left cardiac
 enlargement.  Left basal opacity is slightly more pronounced than on the prior
 study and might reflect interval development of infectious process.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are noted, overall unchanged on the right and slightly
 decreased on the left.  The opacity on the left may in fact represent
 reexpansion pulmonary edema, but reassessment with repeated radiograph is
 recommended.  No pneumothorax is seen.
