                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with possible left lower lobe pneumonia and
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Large left pleural effusion is larger.  Since there is no rightward
 mediastinal shift, it is met with an equivalent volume of increasing left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Left upper lung is clear.  Slight change in shape of
 the cardiac silhouette could reflect developing pericardial effusion, but if
 so, there is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest that it is
 hemodynamically significant.
 
 Small right pleural effusion is stable.  Aside from mild right basal
 atelectasis, right lung is clear.  Granulomatous calcifications are scattered
 through the hila and mediastinum.  A stent in the left brachiocephalic vein
 has not migrated since at least ___.
