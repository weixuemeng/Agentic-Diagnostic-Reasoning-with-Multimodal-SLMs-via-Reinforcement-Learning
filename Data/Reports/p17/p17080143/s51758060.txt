                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior study, there may be a mild worsening
 in the substantial left pleural effusion.  There is an area of opacification
 at the right base which, in the appropriate clinical setting, could be
 consistent with a developing consolidation.
