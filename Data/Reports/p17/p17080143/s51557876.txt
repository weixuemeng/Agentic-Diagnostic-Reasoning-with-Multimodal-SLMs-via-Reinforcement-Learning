                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and CT
 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, there has been an interval increase in
 the patient's left pleural effusion, now moderate in size.  A consolidative
 process within left lung base, better characterized on the recent CT chest
 examination, is not well evaluated on this exam.  The patient's right pleural
 effusion is small and unchanged from prior exam.  The mid and upper lung
 fields are relatively clear without focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 overt pulmonary edema identified.  Stable, moderate cardiomegaly is noted.  A
 vascular stent is seen projecting over the mediastinum, unchanged in
 appearance.
