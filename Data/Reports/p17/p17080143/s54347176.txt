 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions have not changed appreciably
 for more than a week.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size is probably stable,
 though partially obscured by the left pleural effusion.  There are no findings
 to suggest mediastinal vascular engorgement.  Venous stent unchanged in
 position, bridging the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.
