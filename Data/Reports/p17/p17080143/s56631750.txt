                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease with cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval decrease in left pleural effusion, potentially related to
 thoracocentesis or other causes.  Small right and small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusions are currently present associated with minimal bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of consolidation to suggest infectious
 process.  Stent most likely in the left brachiocephalic vein is demonstrated.
