 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a moderate

 pneumothorax.  A venous stent is again seen, unchanged in position.  There is
 mild right basilar atelectasis.  A venous stent is again seen, unchanged in
 position.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. There is a
 small right pleural effusion.

 Moderate left pleural effusion increased in size compared to the prior exam

 superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded.
