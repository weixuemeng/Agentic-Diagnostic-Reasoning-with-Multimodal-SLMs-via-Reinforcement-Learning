                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with shortness of breath
 after renal transplantation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is interval substantial increase in currently large left pleural
 effusion.  Right pleural effusion is moderate but increased as well.  Bibasal
 consolidations, left more than right, are present.  They most likely reflect
 areas of atelectasis, and no definitive evidence of infection is seen.  Upper
 zone re-distribution of the pulmonary vasculature is present and might be
 related to mild volume overload.  Stenting in the left subclavian vein is
 present.
