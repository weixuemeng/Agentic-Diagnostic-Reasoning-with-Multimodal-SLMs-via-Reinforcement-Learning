                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD history with increasing O2 requirement
 from 2 - 4 L, wheezing and reduced air flow on exam.  // Evidence of
 pneumothorax? Infiltrate? Edema?     Evidence of pneumothorax? Infiltrate?
 Edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:19
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 09:56
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extubation.  The pulmonary arteries remain enlarged consistent with
 underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. More rounded appearance to the
 right hilum may be entirely vascular etiology although lymphadenopathy should
 also be considered. Right upper lobe nodular opacities are again seen and
 warrant comparison to remote studies or further imaging with CT.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is now indistinct which suggests that there is likely a
 developing infiltrate, either secondary to aspiration or pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
