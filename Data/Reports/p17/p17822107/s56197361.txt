                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Near-syncope.  Evaluate for widened mediastinum or cardiomegaly.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate hyperexpanded lungs.  There
 is a veil like opacity at the left lower lung which could reflect atelectasis,
 effusion or scarring.  There is a more focal hyperdensity which projects over
 the posterior thorax and lower thoracic spine, of uncertain clinical
 significance. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of widened mediastinum or cardiomegaly.  
 
 2.  Left basilar opacity which could reflect atelectasis, effusion, or
 scarring.
 
 3.  There is a hyperdensity which projects over the posterior thorax and lower
 thoracic spine, of uncertain clinical significance. Recommend a non-emergent
 CT of the chest for additional evaluation. 
 
 4.  Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with emphysema.
