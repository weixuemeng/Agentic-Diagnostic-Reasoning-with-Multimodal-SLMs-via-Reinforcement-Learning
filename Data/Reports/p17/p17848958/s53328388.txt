                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Motor vehicle crash.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear lucency through the right clavicle is consistent with a
 non-displaced fracture.  No other fractures identified.  A rounded lucency in
 the right second rib is better evaluated on the concurrent CT of the torso. 
 The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Non-displaced right clavicle fracture.
 3.  Lucent right second rib lesion, which is better evaluated on the
 concurrent CT of the torso.  The differential diagnosis included fibrous
 dysplasia or an aneurysmal bone cyst.
