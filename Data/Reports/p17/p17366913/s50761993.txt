                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Linear opacity in the
 right middle lobe is compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Partially imaged
 is an intra medullary rod with multiple screws in the left humerus.  A
 right-sided VP shunt catheter is partially imaged.  Diffuse demineralization
 of the osseous structures is present.  Compression deformity of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body is again noted, but better demonstrated on the prior exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe.  Otherwise no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
