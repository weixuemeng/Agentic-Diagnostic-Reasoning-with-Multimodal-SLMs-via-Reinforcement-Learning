                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly better expanded.  However, there is
 residual subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe and to a lesser
 extent in the lingula.  No consolidation or edema is evident.  The mediastinum
 is unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The osseous structures are osteopenic, but
 otherwise unremarkable.  A presumed ventriculoperitoneal shunt again is
 identified traversing over the right hemithorax.  An indwelling internal
 fixation hardware of the left humerus is incompletely evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly better depth of inspiration, however, with residual
 discoid atelectasis as above.  No focal consolidation or superimposed edema
 noted.
