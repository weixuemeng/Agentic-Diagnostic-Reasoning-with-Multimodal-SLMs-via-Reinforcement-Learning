                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia and dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the heart size is again noted. The aortic knob is
 calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases could
 reflect areas of atelectasis. Infection is not excluded. There may be a trace
 left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Partially imaged is a
 right shoulder arthroplasty. Degenerative changes in the left glenohumeral
 joint are noted.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible trace left pleural effusion.
 Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis though infection is not
 completely excluded.
