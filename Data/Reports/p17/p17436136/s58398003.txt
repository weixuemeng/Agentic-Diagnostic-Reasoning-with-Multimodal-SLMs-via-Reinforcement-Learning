                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed earlier in the morning.
 
 Now a small left pleural effusion has markedly increased.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is obscured by the lung abnormalities.  The aorta
 is tortuous.  Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of moderate pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has increased. 
 Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction.
