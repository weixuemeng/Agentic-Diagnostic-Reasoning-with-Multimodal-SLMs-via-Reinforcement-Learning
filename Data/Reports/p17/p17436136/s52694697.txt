                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 20:31.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new nasogastric tube placement, status
 post AAA repair.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 14:55.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 20:31 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The nasogastric tube has its tip overlying the upper mid chest at the level of
 the carina.  Removal and repositioning is advised at this time.  A wet reading
 was provided to ___ by Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at
 9:12 p.m.  Right subclavian central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC.
 Heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy.  Overall mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There continue to be patchy opacities in both lungs with
 associated layering effusions.  These findings most likely reflect a
 combination of pulmonary edema as well as compressive atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.
