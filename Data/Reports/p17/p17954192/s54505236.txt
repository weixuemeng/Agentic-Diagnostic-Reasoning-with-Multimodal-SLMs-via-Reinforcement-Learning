 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo F PMH myotonic dystrophy and substance abuse who presents
 after two seizure-like episodes.  // S/p NGT placement     S/p NGT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the monitoring and
 support devices remain in good position, with the nasogastric tube extending
 to the distal stomach.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure with layering effusions and basilar volume loss,
 especially involving the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed aspiration.
