                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are moderately well inflated.  Bilateral perihilar interstitial
 opacities with moderate cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion is noted.
 Heterogeneous opacity in the left mid lung is present.  No right pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Calcified aortic arch is present.
 
 Severe degenerative disease of the right shoulder is noted.  There is a new
 stent projecting over the left upper hemi thorax at the level of the clavicle,
 likely related to hemodialysis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly and small
 left pleural effusion.
 
 2. Heterogeneous left mid lung opacity likely represents asymmetric pulmonary
 edema however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
