                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status. Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate an enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, unchanged.  There is increased vascular congestion and diffuse
 interstitial opacity.  No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. 
 Calcifications are again seen within the thoracic aorta and within the
 expected location of the carotid arteries.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities are likely due to interstitial edema and less
 likely atypical pneumonia. No focal consolidation to suggest bacterial
 pneumonia.
