 PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Diffuse

 at the right lung base which may represent interstitial edema.  Blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle may represent pleural effusion.  The overall
 pattern appears consistent with heart failure.
