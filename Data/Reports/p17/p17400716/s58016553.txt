                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman on ESRD on HD with bacteremia, fevers  // r/o
 consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 21:01 p.m. targeted review
 of chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, the Swan-Ganz catheter is been removed. No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen is hyperinflation suggestive of background COPD. Also again seen is
 cardiomegaly, with prominence of the mediastinal silhouette and slight
 enlargement of the azygous vein. The aorta is calcified and unfolded. The
 lateral view demonstrates extensive coronary artery calcification. Mild
 prominence of the hila is similar to the prior study.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, the increased interstitial markings,
 peribronchial thickening and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
 The appearance is similar, perhaps slightly more pronounced, than on the prior
 film. Small bilateral effusions are present. There is increased retrocardiac
 opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though
 the hemidiaphragm remains faintly visible, as before. There is minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung base, new compared with the prior study.
 
 Incidental note is made of marked narrowing of the right shoulder acromial
 humeral distance, consistent with a chronic rotator cuff tear.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Cardiomegaly.
 2. CHF with interstitial edema.
 3. Slight enlargement of the azygous vein, consistent with right heart
 failure.
 4. Small effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
 5. Probable background COPD.
 6. Chronic right shoulder rotator cuff tear.
