                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP, upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Evidence of
 pulmonary edema is again seen.  There may be minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle due to a very trace pleural effusion.  No right pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable given the patient is rotated slightly to the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.  More confluent area of opacification in the
 right infrahilar region may relate to prominent vasculature, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting underlying consolidation not be excluded.
