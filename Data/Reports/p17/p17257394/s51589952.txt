                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is top normal, slightly increased since the prior
 study, likely due slightly lower lung volumes and patient rotation.  The lungs
 are clear aside from a small amount of left basilar atelectasis. Apparent
 right lower lobe nodular opacities are most likely due to vessels on end. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax; minimal left posterior pleural scarring is
 chronic.  Hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
