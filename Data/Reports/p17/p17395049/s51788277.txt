                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with stroke, aspiration, new O2 req  // concern
 for worsening PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is prominent but stable.  There are airspace opacities throughout
 both lung fields more confluent at the bases and perihilar regions. This
 likely represents aspiration or developing pneumonia.  The vascular pedicle is
 not widened thus pulmonary edema is felt to be less likely.  Small pleural
 effusions are seen bilaterally.  There are no pneumothoraces.
