                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma, now with wheezing. 
 Evaluate for aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is in unchanged position with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  A
 nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.  A new opacity at the left base with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm likely reflects a small pleural effusion with underlying
 consolidation concerning for aspiration.  The hilar contours are normal. 
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Unchanged opacity projecting over the right apex likely reflects stable
 pleural scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New opacity at the left base reflects probable aspiration with a small pleural
 effusion.
