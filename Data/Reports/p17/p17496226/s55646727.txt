                                 FINAL REPORT

 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube passes below the field of view on the frontal with tip projecting
 over the region of the stomach on the lateral.  Left chest wall triple lead
 pacing device is again noted.  Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, and
 prosthetic aortic valve are again noted.  The lungs are grossly clear. 
 Relatively dense rounded structures projecting over the right mid lung just
 superior to a external snap are not confirmed on the lateral nor seen on
 recent priors.  Given short interval development, these are thought to be
 external in nature.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
