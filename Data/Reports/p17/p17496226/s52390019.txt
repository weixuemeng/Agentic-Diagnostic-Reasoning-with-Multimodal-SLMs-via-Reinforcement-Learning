                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of bilateral subdural hematomas
 status post evacuation, now status post feeding tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires appear intact.  Interval
 placement of a Dobhoff tube with the tip terminating in the stomach.  Normal
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours.  Interval improvement in left basilar
 opacity may reflect improving basilar atelectasis.  Stable right apical
 opacity likely reflects pleural thickening in the setting of prior
 pneumothorax.  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph in 3 months to assess
 stability of presumed right apical pleural thickening.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improving left basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Stable, right apical opacity likely reflects pleural thickening. 
 Recommend follow-up chest radiograph in 3 months to assess stability.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest radiograph in 3 months to assess stability
 of presumed right apical pleural thickening.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 11:53 into the Department of Radiology critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
