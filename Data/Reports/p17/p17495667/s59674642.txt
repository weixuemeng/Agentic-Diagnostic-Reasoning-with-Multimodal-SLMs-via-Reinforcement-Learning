                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/pelvis from ___. Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 the left PICC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs are
 fairly well aerated. There is persistent opacity at the right lung base,
 increased compared to the prior chest radiograph, likely corresponding to the
 small to moderate pleural effusion seen on CT from the day prior. Superimposed
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.  There is no
 evidence of vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
 identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No evidence of vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.
 2. A right base opacity, increased compared to ___, likely
 corresponds to the small to moderate pleural effusion seen on CT from the day
 prior.  However superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Follow
 up to resolution is recommended.
