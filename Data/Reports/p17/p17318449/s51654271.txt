                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath.  History of congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aortic arch is partly
 calcified.  The pulmonary vasculature is minimally prominent suggesting
 pulmonary venous hypertension or slight congestion without frank congestive
 heart failure.  There is also a patchy right infrahilar opacity, suspected to
 represent minor streaky atelectasis.  A linear opacity seen posteriorly on the
 lateral view probably is due to stable scarring in the left lower lobe.  There
 are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Thin anterior flowing
 syndesmophytes are present along the lateral and anterior aspects of the
 visualized thoracic spine, which could be seen with idiopathic skeletal
 hyperostosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suggesting minimal congestion or pulmonary venous hypertension,
 new on this study.
 
 2.  Patchy right basilar opacity suspected to represent minor atelectasis.
