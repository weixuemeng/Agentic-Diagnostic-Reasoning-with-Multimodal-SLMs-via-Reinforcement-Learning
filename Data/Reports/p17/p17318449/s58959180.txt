                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  Lower lung volumes seen on the
 current exam.  Streaky predominantly right-sided mid and lower lung opacities
 are seen, most likely due to atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
 
 Please note the patient's arms are partly obscuring the visualization of the
 lungs on the lateral view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 Median sternotomy wires again noted.  Degenerative changes at the right
 shoulder are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
