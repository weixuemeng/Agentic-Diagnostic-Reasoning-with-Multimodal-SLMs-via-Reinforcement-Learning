                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low resulting
 in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 though no overt interstitial edema.  No confluent consolidation is identified.
 There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior.  Median sternotomy
 wires from prior CABG appear grossly intact on this frontal chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema
 
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly
