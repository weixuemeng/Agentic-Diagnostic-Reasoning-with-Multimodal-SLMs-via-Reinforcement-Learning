                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate slightly lower lung volumes
 compared to the radiograph from 3 days prior, with increased prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild cardiomegaly,
 although the cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate secondary to
 overlying soft tissue.  Mild vascular congestion is similar to slightly
 increased compared to the prior radiograph.  No focal consolidation is
 identified.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild vascular congestion, similar to slightly increased compared to the
 most recent radiograph.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
