                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with SOB.  // pna?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated and the left lung appears to have decreased
 volume as compared to the right. Interstitial markings appear increased
 bilaterally but more so on the left. There is also left perihilar opacity.
 Findings could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema on top of chronic lung
 disease, however atypical infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion is
 seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly
 enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible asymmetric pulmonary edema overlying chronic lung disease however
 underlying infection may be present.
