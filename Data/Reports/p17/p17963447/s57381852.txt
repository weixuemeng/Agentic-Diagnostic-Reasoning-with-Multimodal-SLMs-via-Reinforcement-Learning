                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intermittent respiratory distress.  // ? of
 pneumonia? pulmonary edema?      ? of pneumonia? pulmonary edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has worsened.  Lung volumes remain quite low suggesting
 bibasilar opacification could be a combination of edema and atelectasis, but
 pneumonia is not excluded, particularly on the left.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are presumed.  Mediastinal venous engorgement is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.
