                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  On this more erect study, the cardiac
 silhouette appears slightly less prominent, though this may merely reflect the
 difference in position.  The area of opacification at the right base has
 improved.  The mild vascular congestion is essentially unchanged.
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is obscured, consistent with volume loss at the left
 base and possible small pleural effusion.
