                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acute ischemic right MCA stroke, now status post TPA and clot
 evacuation, check ET tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record
 for comparison.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the level of the midclavicular heads,
 approximately 4.8 cm above the carina.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  This may contribute to accentuation of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung markings.  However, there is increased
 right paratracheal soft tissue density of uncertain etiology.  There is
 increased retrocardiac density.  There is mild diffuse increased opacity in
 both lungs, though this could relate to low inspiratory volumes.  No gross
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube slightly high, at the level of the mid clavicles.
 2.  Right paratracheal density of uncertain etiology or significance. 
 Recommend further assessment with PA and lateral views. 
 3. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  
 4.  The possibility of some background CHF cannot be excluded, but this
 appearance is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
