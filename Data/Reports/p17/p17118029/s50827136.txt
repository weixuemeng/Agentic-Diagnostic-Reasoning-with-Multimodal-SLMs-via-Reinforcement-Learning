                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 No prior chest radiographs for comparison.  Comparison is made to scout images
 of a CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  A dominant
 2.8 cm diameter nodule in the right lower lobe has increased in size since the
 prior CT torso.  A centrally located left suprahilar nodule is difficult to
 compare to the prior study but may also be slightly larger.  Hazy opacity
 adjacent to the right heart border, probably relates to a known chest wall
 mass seen on prior CT.  Linear areas of scar or atelectasis are present within
 the left lower and right middle lobes, but there are no new areas of
 consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.  A small portion of the
 periphery of the right base was excluded from the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: No definite pneumonia. If clinical suspicion persists, consider 
 repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level to allow more complete
 assessment of the lung bases.
