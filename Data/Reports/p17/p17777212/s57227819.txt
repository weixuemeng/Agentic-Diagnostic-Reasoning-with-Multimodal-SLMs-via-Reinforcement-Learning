                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with intubation.  Assess endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is elevation of left hemidiaphragm with subtle left lower lobe opacity. 
 Small left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 An endotracheal tube is 3.5 cm above the level of the carina, in appropriate
 position.  An enteric feeding tube courses midline with tip out of field of
 view and side port below the level of the diaphragm.
 
 Limited evaluation of the osseous structures are unremarkable.  No displaced
 rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Subtle left lower lobe opacity with elevation of left hemidiaphragm is
 most consistent with atelectasis.
 2.  Small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical correlation for superimposed left lower lobe
 infection is recommended.
