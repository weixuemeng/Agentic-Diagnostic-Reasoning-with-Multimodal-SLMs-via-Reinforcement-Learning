 HISTORY:  Esophageal resection, to assess for mediastinitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 However, no evidence of gas within the mediastinum, mediastinal widening,
 pneumonia, or vascular congestion.  Opacification at the left base laterally
 is consistent with atelectasis and possible pleural fluid or thickening.
