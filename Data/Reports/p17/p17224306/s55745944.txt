 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left rib pain.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is borderline in size.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky opacity at the left base suggests
 minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  No rib fractures
 identified.  There is mild S-shaped curvature to the thoracolumbar spine and
 the bones are possibly demineralized to some extent.
