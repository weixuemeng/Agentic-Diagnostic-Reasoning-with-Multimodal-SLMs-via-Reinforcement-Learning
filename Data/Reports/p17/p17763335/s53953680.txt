                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, distal aspect not well appreciated on the frontal
 view, maybe terminating in distal SVC.  The lungs show no focal consolidation.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Previously seen left retrocardiac
 nodular density is not well appreciated on the current study.  Thoracic
 scoliosis is again seen.  However, CT is more sensitive in assessing pulmonary
 nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
