                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough.  History of asthma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Streaky opacities at the right lung base are
 minor and suggest slight atelectasis, which is frequently seen with asthma,
 but without definite findings suggestive of pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes along the mid through
 lower thoracic spine appear unchanged as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
