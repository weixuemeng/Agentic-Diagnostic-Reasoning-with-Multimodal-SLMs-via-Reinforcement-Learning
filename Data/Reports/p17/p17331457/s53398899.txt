                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with recent surgery and abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  On the frontal radiograph, plate-like
 atelectasis is appreciated.  On the lateral, there is also plate-like
 atelectasis.  There is an increased area of opacity overlying the lower
 thoracic spine.  While this could all be related to atelectatic changes given
 the low lung volumes, if the patient has any clinical concern of pneumonia,
 this should be highly considered.  There is no free air.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air.
 2.  Right plate-like atelectasis with an additional area of increased density
 overlying the lower thoracic spine.  This may be related to the low lung
 volumes and atelectasis, although if the patient has clinical symptoms
 worrisome for pneumonia, this should be considered.
