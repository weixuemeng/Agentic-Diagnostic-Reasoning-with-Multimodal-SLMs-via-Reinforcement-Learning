 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged cardiac
 silhouette, likely exaggerated due to technique.  Again seen are vague
 bilateral patchy opacities, in the appropriate clinical context, that could
 represent multifocal pneumonia.  There is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature without definite interlobular septal thickening or pleural
 effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent vague bilateral opacities, could be consistent with multifocal
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
 2.  No definite edema identified.
