                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of
 hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heavy tobacco use, illicit drug use with cough
 and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are within normal limits.  Since the prior study,
 there has been interval decrease in the lung volumes.  In addition, there is
 evidence of diffuse interstitial opacities projecting over the lung bases that
 might reflect interval development of interstitial lung disease.  Correlation
 with chest CT is required.
