                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Delirium, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  There are probable atelectatic
 changes at both bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
