 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right IJ catheter has
 been removed.  No convincing evidence of apical pneumothorax.  There is
 continued opacification at the right base, most likely reflecting a
 combination of layering effusion and atelectasis. However, there is some
 lucency that could suggest the deep sulcus sign of the anterior pneumothorax. 
 CT would be necessary to definitely determine whether this complication is
 present.
 The atelectatic streaks at the left base are improving.
