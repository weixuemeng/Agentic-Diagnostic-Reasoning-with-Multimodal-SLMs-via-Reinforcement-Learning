 The lungs remain mildly hyperinflated.  Left basal airspace opacity has
 improved slightly when compared to the prior study.  There are small residual
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No other areas of consolidation are seen.  There
 is a moderate severe thoracic scoliosis.  A nasogastric tube terminates below
 the left hemidiaphragm.

 Slight interval improvement in the left basal opacity likely reflecting
 combination of pleural fluid and consolidation.
