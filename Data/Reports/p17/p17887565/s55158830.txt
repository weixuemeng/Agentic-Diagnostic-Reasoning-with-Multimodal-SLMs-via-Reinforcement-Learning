 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:42 PM
  Mild perihilar fullness persists.  There is no frank pulmonary edema. 
  Apparent airspace opacity near the left heart border likely represents
  costochondral junction.  Otherwise, no new airspace opacity is detected to
  suggest pneumonia.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The
  cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
  although not well appreciated on this single frontal projection are likely
  still present.

 AP CHEST, 6:43 PM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Since ___, upper lobe pulmonary vascular engorgement, borderline
 interstitial edema have resolved.  There are now several discrete areas of
 what maybe consolidation, left mid lung that could be pneumonia. 
 Opacification at the right lung apex medially has been present since ___,
 presumably tortuous head and neck vessels, confirmed by chest CT ___, when the apex had identical appearance.
 
 Conventional radiographs should be sufficient to follow these findings.
