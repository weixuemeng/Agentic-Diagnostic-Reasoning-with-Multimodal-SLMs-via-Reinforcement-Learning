 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Followup of right middle lobe pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and earlier studies from ___ and ___.  A chest CT is also available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left ventricular
 configuration.  There is similar mild unfolding of the descending thoracic
 aorta.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are persistent
 unchanged bibasilar opacities with low lung volumes that appear most
 consistent with chronic atelectasis or scarring.  There is no definite acute
 increase in opacities.  Moderate-sized anterior osteophytes are present along
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.
