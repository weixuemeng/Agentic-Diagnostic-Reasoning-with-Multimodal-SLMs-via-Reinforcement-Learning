                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with decreased breath sounds bibasilar,
 no cough, is there any chest lesion?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  The
 configuration suggests a prominence of the left ventricular contour, a finding
 which in conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta
 suggests the possibility of systemic hypertension.  There is, however, no
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is a moderate widening of
 the superior mediastinum in the presence of a non-obstructed and non-deviating
 trachea. It raises the possibility of some thyroid enlargement or perhaps
 vascular prominence.  Otherwise, the parenchymal areas of the lung are free
 from any inflammatory abnormalities. The lung bases appear slightly
 hyperlucent and the low-positioned diaphragms are somewhat flattened.  Lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  The thoracic spine demonstrates
 moderate degree of degenerative changes in the form of osteophytic, sometimes
 bridging reactions mostly in the mid portion of the thoracic spine.  No
 vertebral body depression fracture is identified.
 
 Our records do not include a preceding chest examination available for
 comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiac findings suggestive of systemic hypertension but no
 evidence of significant pulmonary vascular congestion. General appearance of
 some emphysema and moderate widening of superior mediastinum suggestive of
 intrathoracic thyroid.
