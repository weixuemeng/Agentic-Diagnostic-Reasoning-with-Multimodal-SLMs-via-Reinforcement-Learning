                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypotension, status post fall, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact appearing
 wires.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable in comparison
 to prior studies.  Calcification of the aortic knob is noted.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema and no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
 Veil-like opacification of the left lung is compatible with layering pleural
 effusion, which is difficult to compare to prior upright radiographs. 
 Increased opacification in the right lung base may be related to the
 diaphragm.  A small right pleural effusion is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural scarring is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Layering left pleural effusion, which is also seen on ___ but difficult to compare due to differences in patient positioning.
