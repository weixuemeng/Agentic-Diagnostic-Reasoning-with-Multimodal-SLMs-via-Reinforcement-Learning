                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cigarette smoker, cough and dyspnea on exertion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are
 unchanged.  Known healed serial rib fractures on the left are unchanged in
 appearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Within the lung
 parenchyma, there is no evidence of focal or diffuse parenchymal opacities. 
 The only abnormality noted are areas of thickened peribronchial tissue,
 notably in the retrocardiac lung regions and at the bottom of the medial
 aspect of the middle lobe.  These could reflect chronic bronchitis, for
 example caused by cigarette smoking.  No pleural effusions.  No hilar or
 mediastinal abnormalities.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 If clinically indicated, bronchial abnormalities could be further evaluated
 with CT.
