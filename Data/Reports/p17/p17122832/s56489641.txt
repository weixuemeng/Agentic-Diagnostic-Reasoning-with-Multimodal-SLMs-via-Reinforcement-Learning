 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of asthma, new onset of shortness of breath, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 613.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild improvement
 with reduction in extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions bilaterally. 
 However, small effusions are still seen at both lung bases.  These are
 associated with minimal areas of atelectasis.  Unchanged borderline size of
 the cardiac silhouette, unchanged normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
