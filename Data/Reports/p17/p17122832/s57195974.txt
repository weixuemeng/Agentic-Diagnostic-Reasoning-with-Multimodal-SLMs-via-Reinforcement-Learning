                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis from the same date performed
 at an outside hospital.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Layering
 bilateral pleural effusions likely account for the lower lung opacities seen. 
 There is also likely a component of compressive atelectasis.  These findings
 are better assessed on the outside hospital CT and appear grossly stable.  The
 mid and upper lungs appear well aerated.  The overall heart size appears
 grossly within normal limits.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Layering bilateral pleural effusions with lower lung atelectasis.
 Findings were more clearly assessed on the outside hospital CT performed on
 the same date.
