                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and cardiomyopathy, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 REPORT:
 
 There is significant cardiomegaly.  Prominent vasculature at the hila,
 particularly in the right side is noted.  There are generalized congestive
 changes seen.  Findings suggestive of a left-sided pleural effusion are also
 seen.
 
 Comparison is made to same day chest radiograph.  This confirms generalized
 congestive change.Changes in the left costophrenic sulcus likely reflect fat
 deposition-no effusion of note on CT
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Findings consistent with CHF.
