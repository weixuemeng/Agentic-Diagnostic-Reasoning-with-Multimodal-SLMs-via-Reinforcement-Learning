                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously reported right middle lobe opacity has partially cleared
 with residual focal opacity remaining adjacent to the right heart border.  The
 residual opacity is similar to that observed on older chest x-ray of ___.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 There are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Partial clearance of right middle lobe opacity, with residual
 opacity which appears similar to baseline radiograph of ___. 
 Although possibly due to scarring, chest CT is recommended to exclude the
 possibility of a localized form of adenocarcinoma which could have a similar
 radiographic appearance.  Findings and recommendation entered into radiology
 communications dashboard on ___.
