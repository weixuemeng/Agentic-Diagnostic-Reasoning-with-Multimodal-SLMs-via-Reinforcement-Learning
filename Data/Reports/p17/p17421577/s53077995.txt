                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, please eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hyperinflated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Diffuse increased interstitial prominence is
 unchanged and likely related to the underlying emphysema.  Dense
 atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob is identified.  IV catheters
 are noted overlying the left antecubital fossa.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Emphysema.
