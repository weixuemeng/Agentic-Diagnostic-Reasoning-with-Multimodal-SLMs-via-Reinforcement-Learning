                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  rising WBC, white productive cough. Has pulmonary edema and
 critical aortic stenosis as well as mitral regurgitation  // ?signs of
 pneumonia     ?signs of pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette, though the pulmonary vascularity is essentially within
 normal limits.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 pleural fluid.
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally
 exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
