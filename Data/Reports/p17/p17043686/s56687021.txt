 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing indistinctness
 and dilatation of pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion, though the overall appearance is still much better than
 the initial study of ___.  There is some increased opacification at the
 left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm and descending aorta,
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to exclude.
