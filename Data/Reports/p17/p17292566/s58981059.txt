                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal pain along with AFib/RVR.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 SINGLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is massive cardiomegaly, which may also represent a very
 large pericardial effusion.  Left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Obscuration of the left
 lung base makes a left pleural effusion hard to exclude.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion and the vascular pedicle is not widened.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Massive cardiomegaly, most consistent with a large pericardial
 effusion.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left basilar opacity could reflect
 atelectasis, though infection is not excluded. A small left pleural effusion
 may be present.
