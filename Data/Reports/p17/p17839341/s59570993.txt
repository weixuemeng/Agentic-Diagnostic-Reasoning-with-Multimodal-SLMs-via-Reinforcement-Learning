                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chronic cough and possible posterior infiltrate on prior chest
 radiograph. Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a left chest wall pacer
 device with leads projecting over the right atrium and ventricle.  A linear
 density projecting over the heart represents either a stent or calcification.
 There is again moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  No definite focal
 consolidation is identified. Moderate pulmonary edema is again seen, mildly
 improved compared to the prior chest radiograph.  Central pulmonary
 vasculature remains prominent.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may be
 slightly increased. There is again no pneumothorax. The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent but mildly improved pulmonary edema.
 2. Redemonstration of bilateral pleural effusions.
