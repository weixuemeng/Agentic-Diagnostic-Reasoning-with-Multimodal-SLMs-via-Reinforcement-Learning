                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follicular lymphoma, fever.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Slight blurring due to motion.  Again seen is the right-sided PICC line with
 tip over proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax identified.  The lungs are grossly
 clear.  
 
 Compared with ___, subtle patchy opacities appear to have resolved.
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
