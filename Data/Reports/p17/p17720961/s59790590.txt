 The right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially clear with no definitive
 abnormalities to suggest infectious symptoms, but if clinical symptoms persist
 and point toward pulmonary infection, evaluation with chest CT is required if
 patient is immunocompromised.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
