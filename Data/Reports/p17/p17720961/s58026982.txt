                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hyperkalemia and crackles.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright portable chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung
 volumes crowd the pulmonary vasculatory.  The right hilus is enlarged.  A
 vague retrocardiac opacity is identified.  Cardiomegaly is mild.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia or atelectasis
 2.  Prominence of the right hilus may be secondary to low lung volumes or
 hilar opacity.  Suggest follow up radiographs, ideally with better
 inspiration.
