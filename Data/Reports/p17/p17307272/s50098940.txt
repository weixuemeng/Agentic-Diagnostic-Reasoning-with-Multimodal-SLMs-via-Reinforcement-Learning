                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left mediastinal mass is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and new interstitial edema. 
 Worsening multifocal patchy lung opacities could reflect patchy atelectasis,
 aspiration, or developing multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Band-like areas of atelectasis are also demonstrated in the left
 lower lobe and adjacent to a fluid-filled minor fissure on the right.  Small
 right pleural effusion is noted.
