                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is new streaky right
 basilar opacity, likely due to right middle and lower lobe atelectasis. 
 Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  The left
 paramediastinal mass is compatible with previously seen cystic structure on
 chest CT.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable given differences in
 positioning.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.  No free
 intraperitoneal air.  Biliary stents are partially visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mostly linear right basilar opacity, most likely due to
 atelectasis, noting that infection cannot be entirely excluded.
