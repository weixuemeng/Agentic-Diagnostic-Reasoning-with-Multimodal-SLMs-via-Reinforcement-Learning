                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, pneumonia.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 5:29 a.m. and allowing for technical differences,
 there may have been slight improvement in the degree of opacity in the left
 mid-zone.  Otherwise, no significant change is detected.  
 
 Left subclavian central line tip over mid SVC again noted.
 
 Again seen are prominent opacities in the left mid and lower zone, with
 retrocardiac air bronchograms and obscuration of the left costophrenic angle
 and left hemidiaphragm.  Probable small left effusion.  There is also some
 patchy perihilar opacity on the right and minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle.  Doubt CHF.
