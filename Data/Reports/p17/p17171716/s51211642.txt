                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart size is normal.  There is a left basilar
 opacity and retrocardiac density, concerning for lower lobe pneumonia or
 effusion.  Linear opacities at the right base likely reflect atelectasis.  The
 remaining areas of the lungs are clear.  The central pulmonary vessels are
 prominent.  There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.  The left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia or effusion. A lateral radiograph can
 be obtained to further localize this process.
