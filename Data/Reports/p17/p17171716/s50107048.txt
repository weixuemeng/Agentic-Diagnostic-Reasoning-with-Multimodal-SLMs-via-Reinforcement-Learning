                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 6:07 A.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Severe asthma with new shortness of breath, fever and chills.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 2:40
 a.m.:
 
 Most of the asymmetric opacification that affects the left hemithorax is due
 to a moderate left pleural effusion.  At the base of the left lung there may
 be a region of pneumonia.  Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement
 suggest concurrent cardiac decompensation, progressed since ___.  Tip
 of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than
 4 cm from the carina, with the chin in neutral position, which is acceptable. 
 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  It would be very
 helpful to obtain a lateral view of the chest to assess how much of the
 abnormality in the left hemithorax is pleural and how much is pulmonary.
