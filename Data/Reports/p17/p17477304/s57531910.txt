                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute onset of shortness of breath.  Question
 fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Compared with prior, there has been no significant
 interval change.  Low lung volumes are seen.  Indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vasculature may be due to minimal volume overload versus from lower lung
 volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Left-sided dual-lumen
 central venous line is in stable position.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
 are unchanged, noting old distal right clavicular fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Indistinctness of the
 pulmonary vasculature which may be due to minimal volume overload or
 potentially accentuated by low lung volumes.
