                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, as before.  The
 lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 mild persistent relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Opacification
 in the left lower lobe along the hemidiaphragm has increased although similar
 to the earlier of two comparison studies.  The pulmonary interstitium is
 minimally prominent, probably due to slight fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left lower lobe opacity, although similar to the
 earlier of two studies.  Recurrence of pneumonia versus waxing and waning
 atelectasis could be considered.  Findings also suggest very mild fluid
 overload.
