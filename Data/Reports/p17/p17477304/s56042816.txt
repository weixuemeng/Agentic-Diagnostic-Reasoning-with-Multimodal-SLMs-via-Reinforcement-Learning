                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with Dyspnea  // evidence of effusion of breathing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary edema which is now moderate in extent has increased when compared to
 the previous exam. The heart size appears mildly enlarged. Small pleural
 effusions appear slightly increased compared to the prior exam. There is no
 pneumothorax. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis. Deformity of the distal right clavicle likely reflects a remote
 fracture. Mediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with increased size of small bilateral
 pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
