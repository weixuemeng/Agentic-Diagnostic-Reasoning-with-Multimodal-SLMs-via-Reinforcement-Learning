                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, desaturation,
 line placement.  Last hemodialysis ___, concern for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Trachea is slightly more displaced to the right partly caused by the tilted
 position of the patient and left lower lung atelectasis.  Left subclavian
 dialysis catheter has been removed.  Tracheal coronal diameter is narrowed as
 shown on previous CT.  There is no pulmonary edema.    There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. There is dense opacity projecting in the left upper
 quadrant of the abdomen measuring 18 mm, possibly in the bowel.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 2.  The trachea is slightly more displaced to the right, probably due to the
 position of the patient and volume loss.  However, considering the fact that
 the dialysis catheter has been recently removed, mediastinal hematoma has to
 be considered but is less likely.  
 
 A followup chest x-ray has been suggested to the medical team.
