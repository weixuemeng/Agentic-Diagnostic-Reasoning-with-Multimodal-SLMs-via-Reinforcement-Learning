                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:27 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and pleural
 effusions after thoracentesis.  Possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 8:09 p.m.:
 
 Aeration in the left lower lobe is worsening.  This could be due to concurrent
 pneumonia or atelectasis exacerbating what is otherwise likely moderately
 severe pulmonary edema.  There may be moderate increasing left pleural
 effusion as well.  Multiple lung nodules are obscured by the edema.  Feeding
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  The heart is not appreciably
 enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
