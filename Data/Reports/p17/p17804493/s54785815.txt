                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left thoracentesis, to assess for reexpansion pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, following thoracentesis there is
 no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild reexpansion edema may be
 present, though it is difficult to discriminate this from underlying
 atelectatic change.
