                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Post pyloric feeding tube is noted with tip coursing off the right inferior
 border of the film.  The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged,
 increased compared to the previous exam.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged
 and compatible with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is new perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.
 A moderate size left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion are
 unchanged from the chest CT from ___, but new from ___. 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mutliple pulmonary nodules seen on the
 prior CT are somewhat obscured by the pulmonary edema on the current exam.
 Expansile lytic lesion of the right 8th rib is re- demonstrated.  Other known
 lytic lesions within the thorax are not well assessed on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New moderate pulmonary edema with moderate size left, and small right
 pleural effusions.  Left basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis though
 infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Known osseous and pulmonary metastases, as well as mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy, are better assessed on the prior CT.
