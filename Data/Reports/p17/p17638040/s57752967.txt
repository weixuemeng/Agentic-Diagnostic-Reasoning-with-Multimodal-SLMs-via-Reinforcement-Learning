 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, pulmonary edema, pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The sternal wires are in unchanged alignment.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly that is new, combined to minimal interstitial markings and
 crowding of the vascular structures at the lung bases, likely reflecting
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural
 effusions.
