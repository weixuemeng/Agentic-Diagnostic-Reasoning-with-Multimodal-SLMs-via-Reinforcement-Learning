                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dementia and alcohol abuse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with
 prominent interstitial markings and intact midline sternal wires.  The
 appearance could well reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though some
 element of chronic interstitial lung disease would have to be considered.
