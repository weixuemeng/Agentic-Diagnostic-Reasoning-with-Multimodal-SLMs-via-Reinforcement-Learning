                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with weakness, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral view radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right total shoulder prosthesis is noted.  A rounded calcific density
 measuring approximately 5 mm overlying the left sternoclavicular joint is
 consistent with a granuloma. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Slight density posterior to the right hemidiaphragm may represent mild pleural
 thickening or a tiny right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible tiny left pleural effusion.
