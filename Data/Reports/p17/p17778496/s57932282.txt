                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Neutropenic fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal views of the chest were obtained.  Vague heterogeneous density in the
 left lower lobe is nonspecific but in the setting of neutropenia may represent
 infection.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 top normal and cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  No
 radiopaque foreign body.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Vague left lower lobe heterogeneous density, which may represent infection in
 the setting of neutropenia vs overlap of structures.  If the patient is able,
 dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
