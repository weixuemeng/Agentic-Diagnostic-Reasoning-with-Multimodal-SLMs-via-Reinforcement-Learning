                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with leukocytosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 02:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient positioning. Cardiac silhouette size
 appears borderline enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are grossly unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Partially imaged is an
 inferior vena cava filter in the midline upper abdomen as well as multiple
 clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly limited by patient positioning. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
