                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IVDU, Hep C, fungual endocarditis, UTI //
 pulm edema vs. pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube terminates in left upper quadrant. Right PICC line terminates in
 the mid SVC.  Diffuse parenchymal opacities and bilateral pleural effusions
 are similar.  Increased opacification of the right lateral lung is likely a
 function of different orientation of the pleural fluid.  Mild superimposed
 edema persists.  Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Continued multifocal parenchymal opacities concerning for widespread
 infection, with mild superimposed edema.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with increased
 density of the right effusion. Consider empyema.
