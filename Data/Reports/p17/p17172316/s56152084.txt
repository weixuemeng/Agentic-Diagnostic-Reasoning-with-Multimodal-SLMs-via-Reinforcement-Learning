                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p fungal endocarditis s/p aortic root/valve
 replacement, admitted with hypotension, s/p bilateral chest tube placement on
 ___ for bilateraly complicated pleural effusions // ? interval change in
 small R upper pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC, unchanged.  Dobhoff tube traverses
 the midline and its tip ends in the stomach.  Median sternotomy wires appear
 intact and unchanged.  The pigtail catheter projects over the right lower
 hemithorax and another over the left lower hemithorax.  Lung volumes remain
 low.  Moderate bilateral atelectasis is overall unchanged.  Moderate right and
 small left pleural effusions are essentially unchanged.  Tiny right apical
 pneumothorax is less appreciated on today's exam but is definitely not
 enlarged.  Small left apical pneumothorax is overall unchanged. No evidence of
 tension.  Mild edema is probably overall unchanged.  Left upper lung opacity
 is better seen on CT. Top normal heart size is unchanged.  Replaced aortic and
 mitral valves are intact and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged and tiny right apical
 pneumothorax appears to have resolved.
