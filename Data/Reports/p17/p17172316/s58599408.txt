 As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen.  The monitoring
 and support devices continue to be in correct position.  The pleural effusion
 and parenchymal opacities as well as the pleural lesions on the right are
 constant.  A minimal hyperlucency at the level of the costophrenic angle on
 the right could suggest the minimal remnant air inclusion in the pleural
 space.  Unchanged appearance of the heart and of the left lung.
