 which ultimately courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
 
 There are low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There
 is an unchanged appearance of supra and infrahilar left-sided consolidative
 opacities.  Left-sided pleural drainage catheter is in place.  There has been
 interval removal of the right-sided pleural drainage catheter and the
 endotracheal tube.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A
 right upper extremity PICC ends in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, and out of the field of view.
