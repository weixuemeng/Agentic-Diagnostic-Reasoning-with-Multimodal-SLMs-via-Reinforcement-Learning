 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:03 PM
  Endotracheal to in appropriate position ending approximately 3.4 cm above the
  carina.  Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach.  A right PICC ends in the mid/low
  SVC.  Left and right basilar pigtail catheters unchanged in position.  A small
  left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size from ___.  Otherwise, no
  significant interval change in appearance of the lungs.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation, pneumonia  // eval location of
 ET tube, interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.  The patient has had previous aortic
 valve replacement.  Bilateral pigtail catheters remain in place.  A right PICC
 line terminates in the low SVC.  A feeding tube terminates in the distal
 stomach.  The small left pleural effusion has decreased, and the right pleural
 effusion is trace at best.  Associated retrocardiac airspace opacification is
 most likely due to left lower lobe collapse.  A small left apical pneumothorax
 has substantially decreased.  A combination of perihilar atelectasis and
 pulmonary edema contributes to persistent bilateral perihilar airspace
 opacities.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacification is likely due to
 persistent atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased small left pleural effusion.  Minimal right pleural effusion not
 appreciably changed.
 Substantially improved left apical pneumothorax.
 Stable left lower lobe collapse.
