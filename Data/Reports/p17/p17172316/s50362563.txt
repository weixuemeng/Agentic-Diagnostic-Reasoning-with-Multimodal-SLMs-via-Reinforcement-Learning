                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with loculated pleural effusions, pulmonary
 edema, respiratory failure, intubated // Please assess for pneumothorax or
 complications of chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from.  ___ at 10:50.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the most recent prior, there is been interval placement of a right
 pleural pigtail drainage catheter with significant improvement in the right
 pleural effusion, now small.  There is mildly improved aeration of the right
 lung, but persistent consolidation is concerning for pneumonia.  The left lung
 is largely unchanged appearance with significant consolidation centrally.
 Gaseous distension of bowel loops in the left upper abdomen is unchanged. 
 ETT, right internal jugular line, and enteric tubes are in unchanged
 positions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval placement of right pleural pigtail drainage catheter with
 significant improvement right pleural effusion, now small. No pneumothorax.
 2. Persistent dense opacity in the right lung, most consistent with infection.
 Please see chest CT for further discussion.
