 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these scout radiograph from the CT of ___ and the chest
 film from ___, there are lower lung volumes.  The various monitoring and
 support devices appear unchanged.  On the right, the pigtail catheter remains
 in place and the hazy opacification consistent with pleural fluid has
 decreased, though some of this could merely represent a more erect position of
 the patient.  Similar changes of volume loss in left lower lobe and left
 effusion are again seen.
 There is increased prominence of a soft tissue opacification in the right apex
 laterally, which has an appearance that could reflect loculated effusion.
