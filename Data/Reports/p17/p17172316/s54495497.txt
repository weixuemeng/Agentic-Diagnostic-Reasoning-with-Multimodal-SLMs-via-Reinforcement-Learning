                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p avr and mv repair  // leukocytosis     
 leukocytosis
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation has been present since ___ in the
 right lower lobe, earlier on the left.  Given the relative stability of the
 left-sided component, this is presumably collapse.  Right lower lobe
 consolidation is a little more pronounced today, but whether that is due to
 real progression or the development of an overlying pleural effusion is
 radiographically indeterminate.  Heart is not enlarged.  Vascular congestion
 and borderline edema are present in the upper lungs, but this could be due in
 large part to redirection of blood flow from the hypoxic lung bases. There is
 no pneumothorax.
