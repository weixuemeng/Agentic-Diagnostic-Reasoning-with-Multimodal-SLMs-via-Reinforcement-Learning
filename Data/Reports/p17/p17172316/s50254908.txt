                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post new bilateral thoracentesis, rule out
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP supine view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors with direct comparison made to study from 6 hours
 prior
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of bilateral pleural pigtail catheters. 
 Remaining support and monitoring devices are in unchanged positions including
 a right IJ which terminates at the distal SVC, ET tube at 4.5 cm above the
 carina, and a partially visualized enteric tube.  Median sternotomy and valve
 replacements are noted.
 
 There are persistent diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally, unchanged since
 prior study.  Bilateral pleural effusions are also unchanged.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of bilateral pleural pigtail catheters.  Otherwise no
 significant change.  No pneumothorax.
