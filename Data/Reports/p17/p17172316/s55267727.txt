                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with VRE sepsis, recent fungal endocarditis and
 increasing O2 requirement  // Assess for new cardiopulmonary process    
 Assess for new cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pigtail catheters remain
 in place.  The pleural effusion on the right, some of which could be
 loculated, is more prominent than on the previous study.  The left pleural
 effusion appears stable and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size or
 slightly enlarged with little change in the degree of pulmonary edema.
 In view of the extensive opacifications in the lungs, it would be extremely
 difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
