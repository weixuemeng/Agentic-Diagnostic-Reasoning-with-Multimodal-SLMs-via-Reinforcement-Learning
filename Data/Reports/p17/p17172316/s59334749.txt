 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of fungal endocarditis, admitted
 with fevers. Now s/p bilateral thoracenteses and bilateral chest tube
 placement  // Please eval placement of bilateral chest tubes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement a right pigtail catheter projecting over the right lower
 hemithorax and a left pigtail catheter projecting over the left lower
 hemithorax.  Bilateral small pleural effusions, greater on the left, are new. 
 Small left apical pneumothorax (approximately 1.5 cm) and tiny right apical
 pneumothorax are new.  No evidence of tension.  Lung volumes remain low, with
 probable reduced aeration of the lungs compared to the prior exam.  The heart
 is normal in size.  Increased interstitial markings bilaterally likely reflect
 mild edema, overall similar to the prior exam.  Right PICC line ends in the
 low SVC. Enteric feeding tube traverses the diaphragm and ends in the stomach.
 Median sternotomy wires appear intact and unchanged.  Replaced valve is
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New small left apical and tiny right apical pneumothoraces.
