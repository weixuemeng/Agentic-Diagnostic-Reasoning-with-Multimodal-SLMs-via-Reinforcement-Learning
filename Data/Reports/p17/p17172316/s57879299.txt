                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachypnea.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph from same day and chest
 radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Nasogastric tube terminates in the midline of the abdomen.  Right upper
 extremity PICC line terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 Prosthetic aortic valve is noted.  Lung volumes are low with a heterogeneous
 opacification in the infrahilar region bilaterally, likely representing
 atelectasis.  Diffuse retrocardiac opacification is indicative of left lower
 lobe collapse.  This could be obscuring an underlying pneumonia.  There is
 mild upper zone redistribution and central pulmonary vascular prominence.  No
 pneumothorax.  Small left effusion is hard to exclude.  There is significant
 dextro convex scoliosis of thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes with left lower lobe collapse, unchanged from ___.
 2.  Right infrahilar opacification likely represents atelectasis.
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
