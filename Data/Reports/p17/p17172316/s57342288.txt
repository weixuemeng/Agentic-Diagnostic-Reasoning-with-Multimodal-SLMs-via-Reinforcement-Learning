                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate left subclavian approach Cordis, in a patient status
 post aortic and mitral valve repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal chest radiograph demonstrate interval removal of a left subclavian
 approach Swan-Ganz catheter.  The endotracheal tube terminating in the mid
 thoracic trachea, enteric 2 terminating below the diaphragm and off the
 inferior edge of the image, a right internal jugular catheter terminating at
 the cavoatrial junction, left chest tube, mediastinal drains, are all
 unchanged in position.  A left subclavian approach catheter projects over the
 expected location of the left subclavian vessels and clavicle, but the
 location is difficult to determine.  It does not follow the expected course of
 the vessel centrally.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and there are
 unchanged bilateral opacities, with a likely left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left subclavian approach catheter projects over the expected location of
 the left subclavian vessels and clavicle, but the location is difficult to
 determine catheter does not follow the expected course of the vessels
 centrally.
