 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fevers.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent diffuse
 bilateral parenchymal opacities, which is worsened over the interval. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube
 ends 4.9 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities
 consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
