                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and new
 orogastric tube placement.  Evaluate for position of orogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral
 parenchymal opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which is slightly
 improved from the prior study.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax or consolidation.  The endotracheal tube
 tip is obscured by overlying sternotomy wires.  A left-sided internal jugular
 line ends in the persistent left SVC.  A nasogastric tube courses into the
 stomach and out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of
 view.
