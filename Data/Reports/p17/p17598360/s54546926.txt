                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, 1:42 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube has
 been minimally pulled back.  The tube, however, is still in correct position. 
 The lung volumes are unchanged.  Moderate pulmonary edema and moderate
 cardiomegaly is still apparent.  The presence of minimal bilateral pleural
 effusions cannot be excluded.  No other relevant changes, in particular no
 pneumothorax.
