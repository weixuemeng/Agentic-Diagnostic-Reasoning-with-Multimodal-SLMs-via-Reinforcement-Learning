                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate central venous line placement in a patient with
 hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  A semi-upright portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a
 left internal jugular central venous line terminating at the expected location
 of the cavoatrial junction.  There is a tracheostomy tube in place.  There is
 moderate-to-severe diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema.  There are layering
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The central venous line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Findings suggestive of decompensated congestive heart failure.
