                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Persistent cough and weight loss and crackles at left base.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Increased opacity over the right side of patient in both the soft
 tissues and the lungs is likely due to patient positioning.  However, there is
 a focal opacity seen best on the lateral view of one of the lower lobes. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lobe pneumonia, unclear whether this is on the right or
 left.
