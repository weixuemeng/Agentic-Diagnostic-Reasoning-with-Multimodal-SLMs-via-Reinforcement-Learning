 INDICATION:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac silhouette size is normal. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.  Linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with either
 subsegmental atelectasis versus scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis or scarring.
