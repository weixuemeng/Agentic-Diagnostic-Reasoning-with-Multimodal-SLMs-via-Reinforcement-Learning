                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ? enlarged heart, crackles left lung, ?
 aortic dilation--___ add cross sectional imaging  // please evaluate heart 
 lung, will also get an ECHO
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased,
 likely caused by a lesser inspiratory effort.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists
 and has not progressed. Moderate tortuosity of the descending aorta. No
 parenchymal pathology, no pleural effusions.
 
 Seen on the frontal radiograph only is a 5 mm rounded lesion, projecting over
 the medial and inferior aspect of the right clavicle, there is unchanged as
 compared to the previous examination, but much better visualized due to
 different technique.  To safely rule out the presence of a potentially
 suspicious lesion, however, CT is recommended.
