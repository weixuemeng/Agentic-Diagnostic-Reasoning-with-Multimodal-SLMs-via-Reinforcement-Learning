                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough and crackles.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  There is also substantial dilatation suspected of the
 aortic arch that might be further correlated with cross-sectional imaging if
 clinically warranted.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.
