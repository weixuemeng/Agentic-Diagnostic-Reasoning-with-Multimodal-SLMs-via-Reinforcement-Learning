                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are lower than on the prior study.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 is top normal in size.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable
 allowing for lower lung volumes. Calcifications are seen along the course of
 the thoracic aorta. Mediastinal post-surgical changes including coronary
 stents and intact median sternotomy wires are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia, edema or effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
