                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, dyspnea, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  There is mild diffuse increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally which could relate to mild fluid overload
 versus atypical infection.  No lobar consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild diffuse increase in interstitial markings, right greater than left, could
 be due to fluid overload versus atypical infection depending on the clinical
 scenario.  No lobar consolidation.
