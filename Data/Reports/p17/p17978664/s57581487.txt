                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and altered
 mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior chest radiograph, right IJ catheter has been removed.  Enteric
 tube courses into the body of the stomach.
 
 Bronchovascular markings are exaggerated by low lung volumes.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, not significantly changed.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity may represent atelectasis, aspiration should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is also streaky right lung base
 atelectasis.  No new consolidation.  No sizable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis.  However, aspiration
 may be considered in the appropriate setting.
