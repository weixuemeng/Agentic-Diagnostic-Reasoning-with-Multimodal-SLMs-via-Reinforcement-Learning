                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ?PNA and respiratory distress  // ?
 worsening PNA, ET tube placement, OG tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right PIC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  ETT terminates
 approximately 5.4 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube terminates in the
 proximal stomach with side holes approximately at the gastroesophageal
 junction and should be advanced approximately 5 cm to be an optimal position.
 
 Lung volumes are low and exaggerate heart size, which is likely mildly
 enlarged.  Previously seen minimal bibasilar atelectasis has improved.  There
 is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  There is minimal central
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Note is made of calcified
 gallstones.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  ETT terminates
 approximately 5.4 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube terminates in the
 proximal stomach and should be advanced approximately 5 cm to ensure that the
 side ports are beyond the GE junction.
 2. Improved minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 3. Minimal central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Stable
 mild cardiomegaly.
 4. Cholelithiasis.
