                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with hypoxia  // evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  Right greater than left basilar opacities
 could be subsequent to atelectasis noting that infection is not excluded. 
 Cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by portable technique with low lung
 volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities more so on the right, potentially atelectasis in setting
 of low lung volumes although infection and/or aspiration are possible.
