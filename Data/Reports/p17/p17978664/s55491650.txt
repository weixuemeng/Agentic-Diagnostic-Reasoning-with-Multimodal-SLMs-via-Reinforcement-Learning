                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure and continued fevers
 despite broad spectrum abx  // Is there interval change, e/o worsening
 infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tip of the right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube courses to
 at least the lower esophagus, but the tip is not captured on the current
 study.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis. 
 However, superimposed infection should be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting, particularly at the left lung base.  No sizable pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular structures.
 2. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, but superimposed
 infection or aspiration should be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
