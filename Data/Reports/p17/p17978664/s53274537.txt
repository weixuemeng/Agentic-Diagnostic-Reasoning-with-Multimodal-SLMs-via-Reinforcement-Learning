                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever and malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Heart size appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 similar.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted and likely the
 result of low lung volumes.  No overt pulmonary edema is present.  Patchy
 opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  Infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
