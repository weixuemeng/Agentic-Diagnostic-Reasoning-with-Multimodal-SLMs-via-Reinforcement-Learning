 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate minimal emphysematous
 changes.  There is no focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Oblong opacity projecting
 over the left hemi thorax is without a correlate on the lateral view, present
 on examination dated ___, probably benign possibly representing
 pleural calcification.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 displaced rib fracture is identified.

 No displaced rib fractures identified.  If clinical concern persists for a rib
 fracture, recommend dedicated rib films with radiopaque markers.
