                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with small white count elevation, history of
 metastatic disease to lungs from renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Numerous
 bilateral pulmonary masses and nodules have a basilar predominance, and are
 decreased in size from the previous radiograph, and not substantially changed
 from the previous CT allowing for differences in modalities.  No new focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.  Known T1 vertebral body lytic lesion is better
 assessed on the prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Innumerable pulmonary metastases, decreased in size compared to the previous
 chest radiograph, and relatively unchanged compared to the previous chest CT
 allowing for differences in modalities.  No new focal consolidation to suggest
 pneumonia.
