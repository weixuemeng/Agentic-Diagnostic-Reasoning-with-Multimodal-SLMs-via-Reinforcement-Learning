                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pulm infiltrates, metastatic
 disease vs. edema vs. infectious etiology  // ___ year old man with bilateral
 pulm infiltrates, metastatic disease vs. edema vs. infectious etiology    ___
 year old man with bilateral pulm infiltrates, metastatic disease vs. edema vs.
 infectious etiology
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Diffuse metastatic disease is again noted, better characterized on the recent
 CT scan.  No increase in pulmonary venous pressure from the previous study. 
 In view of the extensive pulmonary opacifications, it would be extremely
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
