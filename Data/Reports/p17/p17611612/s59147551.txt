                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with RCC and confusion  // Mass? Blood?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules which have progressed in size
 and number when compared to prior.  More confluent consolidation identified in
 the right lower lobe as well.  Blunting of posterior costophrenic angle the
 right suggests small effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in size and number of pulmonary nodules and masses with most
 dense consolidation at the right lung base which is new.  This could be due to
 underlying mass although other superimposed acute process is possible.
