                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with hypotension  // Effusion?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are clear without confluent consolidation. Blunting of left costophrenic
 angle could be due to small effusion or atelectasis. Prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by technique although there
 may be underlying cardiomegaly. Old healed posterior right rib fractures are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to small effusion versus
 atelectasis. Otherwise no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
