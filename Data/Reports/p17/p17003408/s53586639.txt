                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided atrioventricular pacemaker is obscuring part of right lung base. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is seen with pulmonary vessel cephalisation and
 peribronchovascular cuffing.  Left lower lobe opacity is compatible with
 atelectasis.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is a right jugular line in place with distal end that is hard to see
 secondary to the pacemaker lead.  Surgical clips are seen in the neck possibly
 from previous thyroid surgery.  The cardiac contour is mildly enlarged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Pulmonary edema is mild.
