                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The heart is moderately tortuous. There is a very
 small pleural effusion on the right. There is no definite pleural effusion on
 the left, but the possibility cannot be excluded. Mild pleural thickening at
 each lung apex is consistent with minor scarring. There is a nodular focus
 projecting over the medial right lower lung which may correspond to a focus
 projecting over the posterior right lower lobe, a possible pulmonary nodule in
 the right lower lobe. Otherwise the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 2. Small suspected right-sided pleural effusion.
