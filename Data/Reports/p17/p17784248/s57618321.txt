                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent left effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
 resolution of left pleural effusion with minimal residual pleural effusion. 
 The lungs are hyperexpanded indicative of emphysema.  Post-radiation fibrotic
 changes of the left apex are again noted.  Surgical clips in the left axilla
 are also seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Near complete resolution of left pleural effusion.
