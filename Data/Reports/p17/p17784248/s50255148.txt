                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer and radiation with nonproductive cough.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 2 views were obtained of the chest.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion may
 be loculated and is located anteriorly with accompanying opacification of the
 left lung base which may reflect compressive atelectasis though a component of
 infectious pathology cannot be excluded.  Left apical pleural thickening and
 surrounding interstitial abnormality is of uncertain acuity given absence of
 prior studies though in the setting of prior breast cancer, this could reflect
 post radiation changes.  Mild right basilar opacity is also of uncertain
 significance and could reflect atelectasis or infectious process.  The heart
 and mediastinum are unremarkable though slightly shifted to the right.  No
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Possibly loculated left pleural effusion with bibasilar opacities which could
 reflect atelectasis or infection.  Left apical pleural and parenchymal changes
 are of uncertain acuity and may relate to prior radiation therapy.
