                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD and history of
 breast cancer with increasing dyspnea on exertion.
 
 PA and lateral as well as right decubitus and left decubitus were reviewed.
 
 The left upper lung consolidation is unchanged.  Heart size is enlarged,
 unchanged.  Upper zone re-distribution of the vasculature is re-demonstrated. 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval decrease in the left pleural
 effusion.  The decubitus view demonstrates relatively small amount of layering
 effusion or the right and small-to-moderate amount of layering effusion on the
 left.  No pneumothorax is seen.
