                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer and left pleural effusion status post chest tube. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest when compared to the
 prior study demonstrates increased lung volumes with hyperinflation,
 flattening of the diaphragms, and increased AP diameter, consistent with
 emphysematous change.  Moderate left pleural effusion is relatively unchanged.
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.  Surgical clips are again
 noted in the left axilla, likely from breast surgery. Left apicolateral lung
 fibrosis is seen, likely post-radiation changes.  Calcified aortic knob is
 again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in lung volumes with minimal change in moderate
 left pleural effusion.
