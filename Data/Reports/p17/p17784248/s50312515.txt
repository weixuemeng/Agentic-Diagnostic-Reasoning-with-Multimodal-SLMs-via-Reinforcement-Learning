                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with fever.
 
 PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Small left pleural effusion slightly larger today than on ___, was
 appreciably larger on ___.  Sharply demarcated region of
 heterogeneous consolidation and bronchiectasis in the left apex, in the
 setting of prior left mastectomy and vascular clips denoting dissection in the
 left axilla is radiation fibrosis.  This has not really changed since ___.
 
 A better candidate for acute pneumonia is a relatively round region of a mild
 increased opacification at the right lung base and peribronchial infiltration
 just superior to it.  Borderline cardiac enlargement has increased since
 ___, and there is an increase in vascular congestion and the suggestion of
 early edema in the left mid lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Increase in heart size, left pleural effusion, mild left-sided edema and
 vascular congestion all point to cardiac decompensation.  If abnormality in
 the left mid lung fails to clear with treatment of heart failure, then a
 lymphangitic tumor extension should be considered.
