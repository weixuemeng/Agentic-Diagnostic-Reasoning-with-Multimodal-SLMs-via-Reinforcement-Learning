                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post thoracocentesis, followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 thoracocentesis.  A substantial part of the pre-existing left pleural effusion
 has been drained.  A minimal amount of effusion remains, visible at the level
 of the costophrenic sinus.  Potentially post-effusion, pleural thickening on
 the left.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, fibrotic changes at the lung
 parenchyma after radiation and the clips in the left axillary region are
 constant in appearance.
