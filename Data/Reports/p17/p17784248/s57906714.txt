                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion and a prior history of
 blood left upper extremity DVT.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Leftward curvature of the mid thoracic spine is moderate.  Tubing external to
 the patient projecting over the right apex limits detailed evaluation of the
 parenchyma in this region.  Stable appearance of opacity in the left apex with
 associated volume loss, reflecting radiation fibrosis.  Mild right apical
 pleural thickening is unchanged.
 
 Subtle increased opacity in the left lower hemithorax with increasing
 indistinctness of the left half border compared to the prior 2 exams could
 indicate developing infection in the appropriate clinical situation or
 atelectasis.  Increased interstitial markings is nonspecific and could
 indicate underlying interstitial lung disease.  No frank pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is also
 overall unchanged with persistent mild cardiomegaly.  Dilation of the
 pulmonary arteries is better appreciated on the cross-sectional imaging
 previously.  Calcification of the aortic knob is moderate to severe,
 unchanged.
 
 Surgical clips projecting over the left axilla and right upper quadrant are
 unchanged.  The patient has had prior left mastectomy.
 
 There may be calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and mild
 degenerative changes in the visualized thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased left hemithorax opacity on the frontal view over the last 2
 exams could be atelectasis or developing infection or consolidation
 appropriate clinical situation.  If there is high concern CT could be helpful
 to further evaluate.
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly without frank pulmonary edema.
