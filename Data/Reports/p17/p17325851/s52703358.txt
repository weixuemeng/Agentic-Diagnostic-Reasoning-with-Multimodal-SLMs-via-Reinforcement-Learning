                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:37 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell cancer after CVA
 and G-tube placement.  Coughing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 What I presume there is the gastrostomy tube projects over the left upper
 quadrant, but the stomach appears to be substantially distended with gas and
 fluid.  Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung volumes.  There is
 greater consolidation today at the base of the left lung than it was on
 ___.  This could be due to either atelectasis or recent
 aspiration or even pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Transvenous pacer lead
 follows the expected course.  Dr. ___ was paged at 12:05 p.m. as soon as
 the findings were recognized and we discussed the findings at 12:20pm.
