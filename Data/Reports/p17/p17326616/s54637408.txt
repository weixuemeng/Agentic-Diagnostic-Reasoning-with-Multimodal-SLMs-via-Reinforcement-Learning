                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoixa
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single AP upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates several healed
 fractures involving the right ribs. Opacity at the left lung base may reflect
 atelectasis or alternatively scarring. An early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 The remaining lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits allowing for patient positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity at the left lung base may reflect atelectasis or alternatively
 scarring. In the appropriate clinical setting, early pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
