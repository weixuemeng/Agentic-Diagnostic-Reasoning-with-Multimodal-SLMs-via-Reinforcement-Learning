 opacification in the medial right lower lung zone with obliteration of the
 right heart border reflects consolidation or atelectasis in the right middle
 lobe.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly similar to the prior examination.
 2.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the prior
 examination.
 3.  Hazy opacification with obliteration of the right heart border may reflect
 atelectasis or consolidation in the right middle lobe.
