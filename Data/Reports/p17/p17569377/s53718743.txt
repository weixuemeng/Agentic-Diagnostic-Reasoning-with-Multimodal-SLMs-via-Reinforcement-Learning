                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent esophageal stent placed, now anorexic.  Evaluate stent
 placement and position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged from
 prior study.  Again seen is an esophageal stent which appears unchanged in
 position from prior examination.  Visualization is also made of a
 tracheo-bronchial stent which also appears patent and unchanged in position.
 Compared to prior study, there is new consolidation of the left lung base
 which may be atelectatic, however, infection in the correct clinical
 circumstance cannot be excluded.  There is redemonstration of a roughly 3 cm
 mass in the right lung apex with apparent area of internal cavitation,
 unchanged from prior study.  A left-sided infusion port remains unchanged in
 position.  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New left lung base consolidation which is likely atelectatic, however,
 infection cannot be excluded given the correct clinical circumstance.
 2.  Esophageal stent and the tracheobronchial stent unchanged in position
 appearing grossly patent.
 3.  Unchanged appearance of likely a cavitary mass in the right lung apex.
