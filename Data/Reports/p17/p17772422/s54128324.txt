                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p pedestrian struck.  Eval for CHF/pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest and chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower, causing crowding
 of bronchovascular structures.  Patient is post CABG with intact median
 sternotomy wires and unchanged mediastinal clips.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  A
 calcified 1.1 cm granuloma, as seen on this chest CT, is noted in the right
 lower lung.  Although chest radiograph is not optimal for evaluation after
 chest trauma, no acute bony abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lower lung volumes, and unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
