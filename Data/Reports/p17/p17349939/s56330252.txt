                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with tachycardia, hypotension and vomiting. 
 Question infection or aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval intubation
 with ET tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is coiled
 within the stomach.  A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter
 has tip in the upper right atrium.  The heart is normal in size.  The lung
 volumes are low.  There is mild pulmonary edema and right perifissural
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Widened left upper mediastinum and obscured aortic knob would suggest aortic
 dissection in an older patient, or mediastinal hematoma after an attempted
 line placement, and need to be correlated with the clinical circumstances of
 this patient.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube and enteric tube appropriate in position.
 2.  Right IJ central venous catheter has tip in the upper atrium.
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema, likely related to resuscitation.
 4.  Wide left upper mediastinum, possibly due to hematoma or aortic dissection
 should be considered in clinical context before any additional imaging.  
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ by phone at 10am on ___.
