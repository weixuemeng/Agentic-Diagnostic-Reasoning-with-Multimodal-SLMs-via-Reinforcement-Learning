                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Prostate cancer with history of lung cancer status post right
 upper lobectomy.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm and volume loss of the right upper lobe consistent with prior
 right upper lobectomy.  Increase in airspace opacity in the right mid lung
 field as compared to the prior study may represent a developing infection, or
 atelectasis and scarring.  The cardiac size and mediastinal contour is normal
 and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The left lung is clear.
 Heterogeneity of the bones is in keeping with diffuse osseous metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in airspace opacity in the right mid lung zone
 could be due to developing infection, however may represent atelectasis and
 scarring.  Followup radiograph is recommended after treatment.
