 moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities are likely
 combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis but underlying consolidation
 cannot be excluded.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess due to
 bibasilar opacities.  Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is noted.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
