  The left PICC has been removed in the interim.  Enteric tube traverses the
  diaphragm and appears to have been advanced, probably post pyloric since the
  prior exam.  Lung volumes remain low.  Increased opacity in the right
  infrahilar region may be from peribronchovascular crowding in the setting of
  low lung volumes, less likely focal pneumonia.  Retrocardiac opacity with
  indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm is probably atelectasis.  No large
  pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is unchanged.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recent admission for pancreatitis c/b ARDS
 and septic shock s/p ___ anesthetic in 2 days (___ with ?aspiration event)
 with tachypnea, increased O2 requirement after PTBD and paracentesis  //
 ?atelectasis/PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has removal of the left-sided central line.  There remains a feeding
 tube whose distal tip is not included on the field of view.  There are low
 lung volumes with a left retrocardiac opacity.  There is atelectasis at the
 lung bases.  Heart size is upper limits normal.  There are no signs for
 pneumothoraces.
