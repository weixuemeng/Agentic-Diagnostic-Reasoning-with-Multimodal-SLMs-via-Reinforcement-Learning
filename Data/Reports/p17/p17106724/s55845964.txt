                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe pancreatitis, resp failure  //
 Interval change      Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 19:52.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion and moderately severe pulmonary edema have
 worsened over the past 12 hr.  Severe cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion
 and the left lower lobe collapse are unchanged.  Concurrent pneumonia would
 not be appreciated on this examination.  No pneumothorax.  Stable widening of
 the mediastinum could be explained by vascular engorgement alone but
 adenopathy is not excluded and CT scanning would be required to look for a
 mediastinal extension of pancreatic pseudocyst or phlegmon.
 
 ET tube, right jugular line, and esophageal drainage tube are in standard
 placements.
