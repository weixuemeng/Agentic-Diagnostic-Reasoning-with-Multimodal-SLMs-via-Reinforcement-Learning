                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with c/o elevated glucose and some confusion  // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are normally expanded. There is mild coarsening of interstitial
 markings similar to the prior study. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 Opacities projecting over the spine on lateral radiograph likely reflect
 atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Surgical clips
 projecting in the left apex are likely from prior wedge resection. Heart size
 is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Coils are seen in
 the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No convincing evidence of pneumonia. Opacities projecting over the spine on
 the lateral radiograph are likely atelectasis.
