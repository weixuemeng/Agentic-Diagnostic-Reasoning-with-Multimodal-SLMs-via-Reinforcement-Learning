 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cancer surveillance.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral radiograph from ___ and a chest CT
 from ___ are available.
 
 FINDINGS:  In the interval, there is no evidence of relevant change. 
 Substantial right apical pleural thickening with volume loss of the right
 upper lobe, following right upper lobectomy and posterior segment of the left
 upper lobe wedge resection.
 
 The relatively extensive and inhomogeneous parenchymal opacities at the right
 apex are unchanged in distribution and severity.  Also unchanged is the upward
 displacement of the right hilar structures.  The right lung base is constant
 in appearance.
 
 On the left, the course and position of the staple line is constant.  No
 evidence of left-sided recurrence or abnormality.  Unchanged appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette and the mediastinal structures.
