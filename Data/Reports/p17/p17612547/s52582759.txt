                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Decreased p.o. intake.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Dual-lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the
 right atrium and ventricle.  There are scattered areas of atelectasis in the
 mid-to-lower lung fields bilaterally.  Patchy left base opacity may relate to
 atelectasis, although an early consolidation cannot be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
