                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough, smoker.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally.  Findings could be due
 to interstitial edema versus atypical infection.  No focal consolidation. 
 Mild left base atelectasis/scarring.  As also seen on the chest radiograph
 from ___, there is a nodular opacity projecting over the medial right
 upper lung, which is grossly stable in size since ___, and may relate to the
 anterior aspect of the right first rib.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  Degenerative changes are seen at bilateral shoulder and
 acromioclavicular joints, not fully imaged.  Small densities projecting
 between the humeral head and the acromion may represent calcific
 tendinosis/bursitis, although intra-articular loose body is not excluded.  If
 clinical concern, dedicated imaging of the shoulder joints may be obtained.
