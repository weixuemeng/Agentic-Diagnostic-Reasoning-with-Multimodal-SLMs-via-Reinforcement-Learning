                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs. Reference made to subsequent chest
 CT.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Collapse of the right lower lobe with elevation of right hemidiaphragm is
 seen, better assessed on CT. There is also right upper lobe opacity, in part
 due to tortuous vessels and also atelectasis.  Opacity along the minor fissure
 may be due to atelectasis and/or pleural fluid.  The left lung is clear. There
 is no left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The
 aorta is tortuous. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right lung volume loss and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, better
 assessed on subsequent CT.  Opacity along the minor fissure may be due to
 pulmonary fluid and/or atelectasis.
