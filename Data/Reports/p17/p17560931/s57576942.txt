                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Questioned
 possible 7 mm pulmonary nodule projecting over the right mid lung on the prior
 study is not well seen on this study.  Chest CT is more sensitive in
 evaluating for small pulmonary nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
