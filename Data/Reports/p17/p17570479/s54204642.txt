                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dementia with syncopal events.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The focal opacity at the left lower lobe likely representative of
 atelectasis.  Scarring/band-like atelectasis in the right lower lobe appears
 stable.  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The heart remains moderately
 enlarged but stable.  The aorta appears tortuous and may be enlarged in the
 lower thorax. No acute fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe opacity which is most likely representative of
 atelectasis. If clinical suspicion for pneumonia is high, a lateral view
 should be obtained.
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.
