  1. Diffuse parenchymal opacities could represent severe pulmonary edema or
  ARDS, infection or pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded. Close followup
  with sequential radiographs is recommended.
  2. Moderate left pleural effusion.
  3. Endotracheal tube ends 6.8 cm the carina.
  4. Enteric tube terminates above the diaphragm and should be advanced for
  optimal positioning.
  5. Calcification projecting over the right axilla middle is calcified lymph
  node or heterotopic ossification.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia, intubated, evaluate ETT placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm from the carina.  The enteric tube is
 seen terminating above the diaphragm, though should be advanced.  For optimal
 placement within the stomach.  Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities,
 right worse than left, could represent severe pulmonary edema or ARDS. 
 However infection or pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  A left pleural
 effusion is moderate.  Calcification projecting over the right axilla could
 represent calcified lymph nodes or heterotopic ossification.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
