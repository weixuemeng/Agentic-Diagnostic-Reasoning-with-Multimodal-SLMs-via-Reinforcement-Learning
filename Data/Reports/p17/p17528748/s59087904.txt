  1. Platelike bibasilar opacities with hypoinflated lungs is most consistent
  with atelectasis.  Clinical correlation recommended to assess for superimposed
  infection.
  
  2. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia and tachypnea.  Assess for pneumothorax, pleural
 fluid, or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal semi upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen/ pelvis with contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and plate like
 bibasilar opacities.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Top-normal heart
 and mediastinum is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.  Hila is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Platelike bibasilar opacities with hypoinflated lungs is most consistent
 with atelectasis.  Clinical correlation recommended to assess for superimposed
 infection.
 
 2. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
