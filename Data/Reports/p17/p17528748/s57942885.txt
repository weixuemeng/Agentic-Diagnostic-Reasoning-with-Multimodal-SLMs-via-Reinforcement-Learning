                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new fever  // ?PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are improved.  Heart size
 at the upper limits of normal, but unchanged.  No CHF.
 
 Again seen is platelike opacity at both lung bases, more pronounced on the
 right.  Compared to ___, the right base opacity is slightly
 larger.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or
 consolidation.  Possible minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles, but no
 gross effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities at both lung bases, right-greater-than-left, more pronounced
 than on ___.  The appearance is most suggestive of bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Superimposed infection, particularly on the right, is considered
 less likely, but would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
