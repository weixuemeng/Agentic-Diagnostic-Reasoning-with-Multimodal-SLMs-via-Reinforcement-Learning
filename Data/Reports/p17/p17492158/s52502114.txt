 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with intermittent persistent cough,
 evaluate for pathology.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  The heart size is normal.  No
 configurational abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta is mildly widened
 and elongated but without evidence of local contour abnormalities.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal
 infiltrates are present, and lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free. 
 Noteworthy are some low positioned and slightly flattened diaphragms
 coinciding with slightly increased translucency of the lung bases suggesting
 the possibility of emphysema.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the
 apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no evidence of cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary congestion or acute infiltrates in this ___-year-old male patient
 with intermittent cough.
