 placemnet
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___, earlier today, at ___:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Thoracic spine hardware is again noted. Overall, there are relatively low lung
 volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  Bibasilar aspiration is difficult to
 exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. Enteric tube
 courses below the diaphragm into the left abdomen, inferior aspect not seen.
 The distal end of the endotracheal tube is difficult to see due to underlying
 thoracic spine hardware; a thin line overlies the right carina, can not
 exclude right mainstem intubation.  Subsequent chest radiograph was performed
 after apparent adjustment of the endotracheal tube.
