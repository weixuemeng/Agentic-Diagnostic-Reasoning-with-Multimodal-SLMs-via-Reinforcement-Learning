                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 10:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with thoracic spine osteomyelitis, postop
 day 3, now with cough.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:13.
 
 Portable upright chest film, ___ at 10:39, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Spinal hardware overlies the upper and mid thoracic spine in this patient with
 a history of thoracic spine osteomyelitis.  Interval extubation.  Right
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged.  Lung
 volumes remain relatively low with streaky linear opacities at both bases,
 right greater than left, which may represent subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.  Possible small right effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax or
 pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within
 normal limits and unchanged given differences in positioning between studies. 
 No definite focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. 
 However, if the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be
 considered.
