                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated same day, ___, proximally ___ min
 prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube.  Spinal
 hardware projects over the anticipated tip of the endotracheal tube. At best
 the endotracheal tube is 2 cm above the level of the carinal. Patient appears
 to have her neck flexed in which case endotracheal tube placement is
 appropriate. An enteric tube descends the thorax in an uncomplicated course,
 its tip not visualized. Relative to prior examination, the thorax appears
 unchanged with low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip obscured by overlying spinal hardware. At best the
 endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the level of the carina. In a patient
 with neck flexed, this is appropriately placed.
