 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Worsening ___'s disease symptoms.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Mild
 coarsening of lung markings in the upper lungs is fairly similar to the prior
 study allowing for differences in technique.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated with respect to the
 left.  The bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
