                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with asthma and shortness of breath
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Stable elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is noted. Lungs remain clear without focal consolidation,
 effusion or pneumothorax. A subtle nodular opacity projects over the left
 lower lung adjacent to the left heart border, likely representing confluence
 of shadows. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle nodular opacity abutting the left heart border, thought to represent
 summation of shadows. Consider obliques views of the chest to further assess.
