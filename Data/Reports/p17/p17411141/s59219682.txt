                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male stabbed in the left flank. Assessed for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left apical chest tube is essentially unchanged in position. There has been
 interval removal of the left subclavian central venous catheter. There is a
 new small left apical pneumothorax. Increased retrocardiac opacification is
 likely due to atelectasis. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
 due to a new small left pleural effusion. The right lung is hypoinflated,
 somewhat limiting evaluation. However, indistinctness of the vessels at the
 medial right lung base may be due to developing airspace disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New small left apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place.
 New small layering left pleural effusion.
 New left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
 Indistinctness of the vessels at the medial right lung base raises suspicion
 for aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 10:14 AM, 60 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
