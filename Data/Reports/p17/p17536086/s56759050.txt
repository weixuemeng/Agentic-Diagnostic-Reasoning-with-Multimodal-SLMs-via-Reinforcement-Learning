 weight loss >10lbs over the last year; hx Ewing's Sarcoma  // any worrisome
 lesion?

 There is no consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No concerning
 parenchymal opacities are identified, within the limitations of radiography. 
 Heart size is normal.  There is suggestion of a slight cortical irregularity
 along the posterior inferior endplate of one of the lower thoracic vertebral
 bodies seen on the lateral view, which is most likely artifactual.

 No radiographic evidence of pulmonary metastases.  However, please note that
 if there is persistent clinical concern for metastatic disease,
 cross-sectional imaging should be obtained.
