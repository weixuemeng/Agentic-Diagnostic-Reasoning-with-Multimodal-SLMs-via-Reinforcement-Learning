 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 2:27 PM
  Low lung volumes with small left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis,
  improved compared to ___.  Dilated bowel loops in the upper
  abdomen are incompletely imaged.  Although this most likely represents colon,
  abdominal radiographs are recommended for more thorough evaluation.  Findings
  and recommendations were discussed with ___ ___ by ___ by

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for
 low lung volumes.  Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated, with interval
 worsening in the left lower lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 present, and also appear increased compared to the prior study.  Distended
 loops of bowel are seen in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, but are
 incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
