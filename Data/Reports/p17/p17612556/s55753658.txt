                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post gastric banding with desaturation.
 Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes,
 accentuating peribronchovascular markings.  However, there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or confluent consolidation.  Blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle may suggest a small pleural effusion.  There is no
 free air under the diaphragm.  The heart is borderline in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with possible small left pleural effusion
 without definite acute abnormality.
