 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:46 PM
  Endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.1 cm above the level
  of the carina.  Enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm,
  ending in the stomach.  Slightly increased right lower lung atelectasis. 
  Otherwise, no significant change compared to the study performed earlier
  today.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:50 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man intubated.  Check ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 4:56 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, with
 the chin in neutral position.  Given the relatively superior position of the
 carina, this is probably acceptable.  Patient has had left upper
 thoracoplasty, and there is only a small region of aerated left lower lobe
 above a chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm.  On the right, small right
 pleural effusion has increased, and aside from the medial right lower lobe
 partially obscured by cardiac silhouette, right lung is clear.  No
 pneumothorax.  An upper enteric drainage tube loops in the upper part of a
 non-distended stomach.  No pneumothorax.
