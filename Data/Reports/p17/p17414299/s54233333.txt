                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p intubation  // tube location
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral, left greater than right lower lobe consolidations are increased
 compared to 1 day prior.  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal
 tube, which terminates approximately 2.2 cm superior to the carina.  A
 right-sided IJ central venous catheter is unchanged in position in the lower
 SVC.  Heart size is normal.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates 2.2 cm above
 the carina.
 2. Increased bibasilar consolidations likely reflect underlying pneumonia.
