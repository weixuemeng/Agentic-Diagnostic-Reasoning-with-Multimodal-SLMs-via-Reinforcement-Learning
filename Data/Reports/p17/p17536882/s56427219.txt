                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough, reported low-grade fever,
 assess for infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged with a prominence of the left ventricular contour
 to the left and posteriorly, but there is no evidence of significant left
 atrial enlargement.  The thoracic aorta is mildly elongated and shows some
 calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  No local contour
 abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and
 there are no signs of acute parenchymal infiltrates, but increased
 interstitial markings on the bases are present, suggestive of increased
 chronic fibrosis, a diagnosis, which was supported by a high definition CT
 examination ___ ___.  Lateral structures of the thorax grossly
 unremarkable.  When comparison is made with the next previous chest
 examination of ___, the patient makes now a better deeper
 inspiration.  New acute parenchymal infiltrates could not be identified. 
 Superior mediastinal structures with mild prominence of the SVC contour is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates in ___-year-old
 female patient with cough and possible low-grade fever.  Findings of the basal
 pulmonary fibrosis appear to be stable.
