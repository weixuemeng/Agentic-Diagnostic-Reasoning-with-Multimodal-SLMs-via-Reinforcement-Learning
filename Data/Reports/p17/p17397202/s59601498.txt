                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TIA, to assess for cardiopulmonary source.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with tortuosity of the aorta.  Pulmonary vascularity is probably at the upper
 limits of normal.  No evidence of pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia. 
 Of incidental note are surgical clips in the abdomen seen only on the lateral
 view.
