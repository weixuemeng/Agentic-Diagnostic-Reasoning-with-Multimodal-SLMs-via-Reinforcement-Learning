                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonias, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.  Film dated ___ at 7:42 a.m. presented now for official
 interpretation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:50 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film and allowing for technical differences, I doubt
 significant interval change.  Again seen is hyperinflation consistent with
 severe COPD.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  There is no CHF,
 focal infiltrate, or effusion.  Minimal tenting of the left hemidiaphragm near
 the apex of the heart is noted on today's exam.  Spinal fixation hardware
 spanning the cervical to upper thoracic spine is again noted, thuogh it
 extends cephalad beyond the upper edge of this film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) COPD.  
 2) No acute pulmonary process identified.  
 2) Minimal tenting of the left hemidiaphragm is new compared with ___. 
 Otherwise, no significant interval change.
