                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with significant left vulvar abscess,
 immunosuppressed, also with cough  // please eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening, which in the setting of
 immunosuppression may represent an atypical bacterial, viral or fungal
 infection.  There is a focal consolidation at the right hilum, which may
 represent a superimposed bacterial pneumonia, however and underlying mass
 cannot be excluded.  The linear opacity within the right mid lung likely
 represents atelectasis.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening, which in the setting of
 immunosuppression may represent an atypical bacterial, viral, or fungal
 infection.  PCP infection may also have this appearance.  Although included in
 the differential, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage is less likely.
 2. Right hilar opacity, which may represent a focus of pneumonia, however an
 underlying mass cannot be excluded.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:37 PM, 15 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Repeat chest x-ray is recommended in ___ weeks to ensure
 resolution of right hilar opacity.  If the right hilar opacity persists, a CT
 may be warranted.
