  3 chest radiographs were obtained. The initial image demonstrates the enteric
  tube coiled in the esophagus with the latter images demonstrate it passing
  through to the stomach. Otherwise, little change in comparison to prior
  studies from the same day with bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent
  atelectasis and gasseous distension of loops of small and large bowel with
  edema likely in the descending colon.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the initial image, the nasogastric tube coiled in the esophagus
 with the tip at the clavicular level.  Subsequent image shows the nasogastric
 tube extending well into the stomach.  Atelectatic changes persist at both
 bases and there is probable adynamic ileus pattern.
