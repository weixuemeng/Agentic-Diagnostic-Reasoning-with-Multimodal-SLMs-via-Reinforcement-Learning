 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The patient shows bilateral relatively symmetrical predominantly
 basal opacities.  The morphology of these opacities is rather suggestive of
 pulmonary edema than of pneumonia.  Cardiomegaly persists.  No larger pleural
 effusions.  No new parenchymal opacities.
