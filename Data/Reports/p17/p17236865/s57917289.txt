                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:14 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with PEA arrest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 10:56 a.m.
 
 Severe heterogeneous consolidative pulmonary abnormality is new since earlier
 in the day.  It is distinctly heterogeneous and has an almost nodular
 component, raising possibility of septic emboli.  Since the radiograph follows
 PEA, there is no way to know whether the accompanying severe pulmonary edema
 preceded or follows the cardiopulmonary events and resuscitation.
 
 A moderate-to-large left pleural effusion is still present.  Heart is not
 particularly enlarged.  ET tube and right PIC line are in standard placements.
 An upper enteric drainage tube passes into a distended stomach and out of
 view.
