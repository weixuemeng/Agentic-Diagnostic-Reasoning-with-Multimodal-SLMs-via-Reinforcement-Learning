                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue and cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 Although much less than before, there is thickening, probably slight fluid
 within the minor fissure, although generalized pulmonary edema has resolved. 
 There is a patchy opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine which
 suggests pneumonia, hard to localized but more likely on the left than right,
 noting vague increased retrocardiac opacity.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior opacity suspicious for pneumonia.  Followup
 radiographs, preferably with standard PA and lateral technique if possible,
 are recommended to assess further when clinically appropriate.  Although it is
 difficult to tell for certain which side the opacity relates to, and it is
 probably more likely on the left noting vague increased retrocardiac
 shadowing.
