                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and right facial droop, here to evaluate
 for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available at this time.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the heart and lungs is limited due to patient
 rotation to the right.  Within this limitation,  the lungs are clear without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette
 is slighlty enlarged, likely accentuated by technique.  The mediastinum is
 prominent, partly related to patient rotation.  The visualized upper abdomen
 is unremarkable.
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process on this technically limited examination.
