 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:26 PM
  Endotracheal tube tip is obscured by thoracic spinal fusion hardware, which is
  new since ___.  Retrocardiac opacity and hazy appearance of the
  right lower lung containing linear opacities are consistent with bilateral
  pleural effusions and atelectasis.  Right IJ central catheter terminates in
  the mid SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:14 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with poor oxygen saturation postop.  Possible lung
 collapse.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Tip of the ET tube is obscured by spinal hardware, but probably in standard
 position, more than 3 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line ends in the
 mid-to-low SVC.
 
 Leftward shift of the mediastinum is new, probably a function of substantial
 left lower lobe atelectasis and new small right pleural effusion.  There is
 also new consolidation at the base of the right lung, another region of
 atelectasis is presumed.  Both lower lungs need to be followed closely to
 exclude developing pneumonia.  The upper lungs are clear and there is no
 pulmonary vascular engorgement or other evidence of cardiac decompensation.
 
 Distention of the intestinal tract seen in the upper abdomen is comparable to
 the preoperative appearance.
