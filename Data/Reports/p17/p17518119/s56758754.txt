 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Brain mass.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Aside from minimal posterior opacification suggesting minor
 atelectasis, the lungs appear clear.  Mild degenerative changes are noted
 along the lower thoracic spine.  Prominent facet hypertrophy is noted along
 the right side at the C4-C5 interspace of the cervical spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
