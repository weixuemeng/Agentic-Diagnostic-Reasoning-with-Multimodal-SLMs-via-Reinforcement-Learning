                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post trauma.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta also
 appears significantly enlarged at the arch.  There is mild lobulation of the
 pleura, suggestive of possible pleural plaques.  The lungs are otherwise clear
 with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No acute
 fractures are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The aorta appears significantly enlarged.  Correlation with clinical
 symptoms is recommended to ensure that this is not an acute dissection. 
 Otherwise, a dedicated chest CT is recommended in a non-emergent setting for
 further characterization.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Slight prominence of the pleura suggestive of possible pleural plaques.
