                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent ppm  // evaluate for pneumothorax
 and lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 15:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, no definite change in the position of
 the left-sided pacemaker.  The single pacemaker lead is unchanged in position,
 overlying the right ventricle.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are relatively low, more so on the per than on the prior
 film.  Allowing for this, there is increased perihilar opacity and atelectasis
 at both lung bases.  Possible vascular plethora.  Increased retrocardiac
 density is again noted.  Otherwise, no frank consolidation is identified. 
 Possible trace fluid at the right cardiophrenic angle.  No gross left-sided
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to compare due to lower lung
 volumes, but is grossly similar.
 
 Incidental note is made of a partially imaged left shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Pacemaker lead overlies the right ventricle, unchanged in position.  Slight
 difference in the position of the pacemaker itself is noted, but may be
 accounted for by differences in patient positioning.
 2. Interval increase in bilateral perihilar opacities.  This may be
 accentuated by low lung volumes resulting in increased atelectasis, but the
 possibility of increased perihilar vascular plethora/ early CHF cannot be
 excluded.
 3. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, unchanged.
 4. Possible small right-sided pleural effusion, new or more pronounced.
