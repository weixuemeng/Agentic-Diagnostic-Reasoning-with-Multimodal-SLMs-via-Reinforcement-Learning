                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with poor oxygen saturation and hemoptysis. 
 Rule out pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates perhaps
 borderline enlarged heart size, although it is difficult to assess on this
 portable study.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pneumothorax,
 focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Possible borderline enlarged
 heart size.
