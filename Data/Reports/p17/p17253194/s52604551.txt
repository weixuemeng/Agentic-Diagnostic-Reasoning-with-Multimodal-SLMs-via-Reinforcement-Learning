                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and tachycardia.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A dual-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the mid-to-lower
 superior vena cava.  The aortic arch is partly calcified.  Otherwise, the
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits noting
 that the heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Mild blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle suggests a very small pleural effusion on the left
 side.  Hyperinflation is suggested by flattening of the hemidiaphragms and an
 expanded anteroposterior dimension of the chest.  There is mild background
 coarsening of lung markings, namely slight interstitial prominence with
 peribronchial cuffing, more prominent in the right lower than left lung,
 although without confluent focal opacification.  Mild degenerative changes are
 noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial prominence, which may reflect airway
 inflammation or possibly slight fluid overload but does not necessarily
 represent an acute finding.  If pulmonary symptoms were to persist, however,
 then followup radiographs could be considered.  A trace pleural effusion is
 suspected on the left.
