 With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 2.5 cm from
 the chronic, acceptable positioning.  Esophageal tube passes into the distal
 stomach. Moderately severe pulmonary edema is improving. Large right pleural
 effusion persists. Given the severity of pulmonary abnormality concurrent
 infection would be difficult to detect,. Heart size is indeterminate given the
 large volume of right pleural effusion, but not substantially changed since
 prior chest radiograph showed mild cardiac enlargement. No pneumothorax.
