                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Alcoholic cirrhosis and hydrothorax presenting with malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are small to moderate pleural effusions bilaterally with opacities at
 the lung bases suggesting minor atelectasis. Effusions are somewhat smaller
 than on the prior radiographs on each side.  On the right, there is again some
 tracking of effusion along the major fissure.  Elsewhere, the lung fields
 remain essentially clear.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with basilar opacities probably
 attributable to atelectasis, somewhat smaller than on the prior study.
