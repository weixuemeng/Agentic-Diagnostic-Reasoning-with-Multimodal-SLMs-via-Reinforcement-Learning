                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p fall 3 days ago and on coumadin.  Assess for rib
 fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs and CT chest from ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and an unfolded aorta are again seen.  Hilar contours are stable.
 There are linear opacities at both lung bases, slightly more conspicuous on
 the left than on the ___ chest radiographs.  There is mild blunting of the
 bilateral posterior costophrenic sulci, similar to prior radiographs.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Mild loss of height in several mid thoracic vertebral
 bodies is unchanged.  Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and
 small anterior endplate osteophytes are again seen in the thoracic spine.  The
 ribs are not well penetrated on chest radiography, as expected, and the
 inferior ribs are not fully imaged.  No displaced rib fracture is definitively
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Linear opacities at both lung bases with increased conspicuity on the left
 compared to ___ chest radiographs.  Unchanged mild blunting of
 bilateral posterior costophrenic sulci.  Evaluation of the ribs is limited.
 
 Please refer to the concurrent chest CT report for further detail.
