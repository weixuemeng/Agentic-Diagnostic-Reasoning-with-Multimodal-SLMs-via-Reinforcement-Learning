 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sob, hypoxia  // chf?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs on ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation of the lung bases is limited (particularly the left base) due to
 overlying soft tissue attenuation.  The heart is enlarged but stable on this
 AP radiograph.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well as likely
 mild CHF.  There is no pneumothorax.  There may be a small to moderate left
 pleural effusion however evaluation is limited due to soft tissue attenuation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Likely small to moderate left effusion with mild CHF.  Overlying soft tissue
 limits evaluation of the lung bases.
