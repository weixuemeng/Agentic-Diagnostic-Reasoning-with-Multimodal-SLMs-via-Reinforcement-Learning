                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right upper lobe lung mass and right pleural effusion status
 post chest tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Now small-to-moderate right effusion has decreased from prior study.  Aeration
 of the right lower lobe has improved.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette including
 cardiac size top normal, shifted towards the left, large diaphragmatic hernia,
 multiple mediastinal lymph nodes and mass-like consolidation in the right
 upper lobe are better seen in prior CT from ___.  The left upper lobe is
 grossly clear.  There is kyphosis.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Right
 basal pleural catheter is in unchanged position.
