                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and hypoxia to ___% on room air.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the
 lungs bilaterally.  There is a large retrocardiac opacity which is partially
 aerated compatible with large hiatal hernia, similar to previous exam.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion or confluent consolidation.  The cardiac
 silhouette is essentially stable, noting lower lung volumes on the current
 exam.  There is apparent inferior subluxation of the left humeral head with
 respect to the glenoid.  Possible cortical stepoff is seen in the medial
 aspect of the humerus.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings in the lungs.  This could be due
 to pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of failure; however, diffuse
 process such as atypical infection is also possible.  Clinical correlation is
 suggested.
 2.  Apparent inferior subluxation of the humeral head with respect to the
 glenoid.  Possible cortical disruption/fracture of the medial aspect of the
 proximal humerus for which dedicated exam is suggested.
