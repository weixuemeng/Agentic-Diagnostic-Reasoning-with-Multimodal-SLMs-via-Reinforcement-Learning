                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  There is reticulonodular opacity in the lower lungs which in the
 correct clinical setting could represent an atypical pneumonia.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Subtle reticulonodular opacities in lower lungs which could represent
 pneumonia.  A dedicated PA and lateral view would be helpful to confirm.
