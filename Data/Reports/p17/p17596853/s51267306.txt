                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and crackles.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Irregular central lower opacities in each lung appear somewhat less prominent
 than on the prior study and small round lucencies are less visible.  There is
 suspicion that this may be due to a process of chronic scarring from prior
 infection although it is difficult to exclude coinciding active atypical
 pneumonia or mild pulmonary edema as possible etiologies.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Central opacities in both lungs, similar to decreased although apparent change
 to some extent may be due to differences in technique.  This appearance is
 probably compatible with chronic scarring from prior infection although
 superimposed atypical pneumonia or even pulmonary edema are not excluded by
 this study.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful.
