                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Previous AP radiograph from today.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral and frontal views are now available.  Whereas the left
 lung looks relatively unremarkable, the right lung bases shows a right lower
 lobe peribronchial opacity, better appreciated on the lateral than on the
 frontal radiograph.  This opacity is highly suggestive of a right lower lobe
 pneumonia.  There is no accompanying pleural effusion.  Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.
