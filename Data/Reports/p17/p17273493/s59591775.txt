                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with progressive distal weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung along volumes remain low.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but not
 substantially changed.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy left basilar opacity
 likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No focal
 consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with minimal patchy left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
