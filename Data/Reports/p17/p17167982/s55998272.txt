                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute desaturation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube projects at the upper margin of the clavicles and should be
 advanced for better positioning. Right internal jugular central venous line
 terminates in the low SVC.  Right chest tube is unchanged in position.
 
 Linear opacities at the right lung base are unchanged over multiple prior
 radiographs, likely reflective of scarring and atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacification persists, possibly reflecting continued atelectasis.  Small
 right pleural effusion is unchanged.  Barium in the left upper quadrant and in
 the region of the gastroesophageal junction persists.
 The large mediastinal fluid collection around the GE junction is not
 appreciated on conventional radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. High position of the endotracheal tube, at the upper margin of the
 clavicular heads, should be advanced.
 2. Unchanged position of the right chest tube and right internal jugular
 central venous line.
 3. Persistent retrocardiac opacification could represent atelectasis.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 9:51 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
