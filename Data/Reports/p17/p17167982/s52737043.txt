                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p remote esophagectomy w/mediastinitis,
 pancreatitis, being diuresed  // ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at ___ and targeted review of
 chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy again seen.  A right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the SVC/RA
 junction.  Right-sided chest tube again present.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Residual
 contrast noted in the gastric fundus which lies above the level of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Small right effusion is better seen on today's chest x-ray. 
 Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is slightly more
 pronounced.  Right upper zone opacity is similar to the prior film.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity is also similar.  The lateral left hemidiaphragm and
 costophrenic sulcus are excluded from the current film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall similar to the prior film.  Please see comment above.
