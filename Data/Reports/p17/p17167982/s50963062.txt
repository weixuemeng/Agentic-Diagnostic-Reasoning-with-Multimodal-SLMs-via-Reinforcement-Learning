 There is confluent opacification at the left base which appears to have
 increased in comparison to the prior radiograph.  The bilateral pleural
 effusions with loculations appear unchanged.  There are diffuse linear
 opacities, most notable in the right upper lung, which represents scarring. 
 Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The
