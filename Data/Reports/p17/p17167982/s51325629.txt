                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new NGT  // position of NGT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Sequential portable upright chest radiographs were obtained after
 manipulation of nasogastric tube position and patient position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube again terminates at the level of the clavicular heads. 
 Right internal jugular central venous line, subdiaphragmatic drain, and right
 chest tube are unchanged in location from earlier this morning.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 The first 2 radiographs, performed with slight difference in all obliquity,
 both show the nasogastric tube in uncertain position, its tip projecting over
 both the right lower lobe bronchus and the expected location of the neo
 esophagus.  A loop of the drainage tube is in the hypopharynx.
 
 The third image, performed after re- insertion of the tube shows that it it
 terminates low in the neo esophagus, and not in the bronchial tree.
 Bibasilar atelectasis worse in the left lung and small pleural effusions are
 present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Right jugular line ends in the upper
 right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Repositioning of the intended gastric drainage tube from the right lower
 lobe bronchus to the neo esophagus.
 2. Stable support lines and tubes otherwise.
