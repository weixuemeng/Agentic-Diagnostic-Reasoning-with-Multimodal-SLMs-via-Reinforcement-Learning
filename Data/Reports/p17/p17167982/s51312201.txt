                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with afib rvr  // medistinum
 
 TECHNIQUE:  portable ap chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  serial chest radiographs, most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Monitoring equipment projects over the right apex, limiting assessment.  A
 tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position compared to the prior study. 
 The patient is somewhat rotated on the current study displacing the trachea to
 the right.  Lung volumes are unchanged with mild hyperinflation on the left. 
 Two right-sided chest drains are unchanged in position.  No definite
 pneumothorax seen but the right apex is not well evaluated.  There has been a
 decrease in the small right pleural effusion.  Airspace opacity at the right
 lung base likely related to atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded however this appearance is improving compared earlier studies.
