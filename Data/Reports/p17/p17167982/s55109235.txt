 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new itnubation  // New intubation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier the same date, an
 endotracheal tube has been advanced and is now in standard position. 
 Considering lower lung volumes on the current study, with associated crowding
 of structures at the lung bases, there has otherwise not been a substantial
 change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of several hr
 earlier.
