 eval for ARDS
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification
 bilaterally with further enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and more
 indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels.  This is all consistent with the
 clinical diagnosis of increased elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Evidence of previous gastric pull-through.  In the absence of a lateral view,
 it is impossible to assess the known right lower lobe hydro pneumothorax seen
 previously.
