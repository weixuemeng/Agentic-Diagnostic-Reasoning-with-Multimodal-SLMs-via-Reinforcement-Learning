                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea, increased O2 requirement with
 presumed pancreatitis  // Eval for interval change in pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusions     Eval for interval change in pulmonary edema, pleural effusio
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is more coalescence
 of opacification at the left base in this patient with enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular congestion.  Although this could
 represent some asymmetric edema, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
