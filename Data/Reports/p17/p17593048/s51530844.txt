                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy is noted.  There is a right
 lung base opacity, which overlies the heart on the lateral projection,
 findings consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia.  The remainder of the
 lungs appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  Enlargement of the right hilar contour likely represents reactive
 hilar adenopathy.  The remainder of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe pneumonia.
