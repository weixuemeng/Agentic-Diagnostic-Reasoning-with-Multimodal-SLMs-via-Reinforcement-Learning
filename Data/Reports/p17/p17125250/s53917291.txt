                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker device with leads terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution of pulmonary vascularity, suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension without frank congestive heart failure.  Otherwise, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting minimal congestion, otherwise unremarkable.
