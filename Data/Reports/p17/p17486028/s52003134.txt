 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with
 multiple calcified anterior mediastinal lymph nodes again demonstrated. 
 Assessment of the right apex is limited due to obscuration by the patient's
 neck.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.  Loss of height of a mid thoracic
 vertebral body appears progressed compared to the prior radiograph.  An IVC
 filter is noted within the upper midline abdomen as well as multiple clips.

 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
