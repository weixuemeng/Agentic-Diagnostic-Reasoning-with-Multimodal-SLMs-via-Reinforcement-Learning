                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY DATED ___ 
  
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for low lung volumes and rotation, cardiac silhouette is
 probably mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous.  Lungs are clear except for
 minor atelectasis at the lung bases.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No pneumothorax or acute rib fracture detected on this portable examination,
 but correlation with subsequently performed CTA of the chest is suggested for
 more complete assessment given the limited sensitivity of portable radiographs
 for assessing rib injuries.
 
 Correlation with CTA results is also recommended for more complete assessment
 of the thoracic aorta.
