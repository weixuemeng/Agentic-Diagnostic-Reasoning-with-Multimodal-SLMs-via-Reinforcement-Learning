                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question interval change, RSV, high fevers.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 4:37 a.m.
 
 Compared with the prior film, the degree of patchy opacity right base is
 slightly worse.  Patchy opacity at the left base probably unchanged allowing
 for differences in technique.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing
 for differences in positioning.  The caliber of the azygos vein is at the
 upper limits of normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suspect slight interval worsening of patchy opacity at right
 base.  Left base opacity is probably similar allowing for technical
 differences.
