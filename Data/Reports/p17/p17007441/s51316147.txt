 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:18 AM
  Coarse bibasilar interstitial opacities are slightly more prominent. No focal
  airspace consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, RSV, hypercarbic respiratory failure, now hypotension. 
 Question pneumonia, pneumothorax, interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 An ET tube is present.  The tip is obscured by overlying structures but
 probably lies approximately 4.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
 also difficult to trace due to technical factors.  I suspect but cannot verify
 that it extends beneath the diaphragm.  A film centered at the GE junction may
 help for further assessment.  A left PICC line is present, tip overlies the
 mid/distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.  There are coarsened
 pulmonary markings at both lung bases, similar but more pronounced than on the
 film obtained earlier the same day.  They are also more pronounced compared
 with the ___ CXR. These could represent developing interstitial
 infiltrates. The differential diagnosis includes atelectasis and
 bronchiectasis, thugh this is considered less likely. There is upper zone
 re-distribution, without overt CHF.  No frank consolidation and no effusion is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Concern for progressing bibasilar insterstitial infiltrates.
