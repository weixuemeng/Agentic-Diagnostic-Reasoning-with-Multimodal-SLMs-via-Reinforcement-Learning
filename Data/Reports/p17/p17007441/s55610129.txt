                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure, status post intubation, question
 interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 18:07 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric-type tube is present, not well traced beyond the lower mediastinum,
 ? due to actual position versus underpenetration.
 
 Left-sided PICC line tip overlies the mid SVC.
 
 Compared to the prior film, there is slightly more confluent atelectasis at
 the left base, with equivocal slight improvement at the right base, but
 overall, the appearance is similar to the prior film.  No new areas of opacity
 or consolidation are identified.  No new effusion.  No overt CHF. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears different due to differences in rotation,
 but is probably unchanged.  Pulmonary hila are both prominent with a tapered
 appearance, raising a question of background pulmonary hypertension,
 unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Overall, minimal interval change.  Bibasilar opacity is again noted.  
 
 2) Orogastric tube cannot be traced beyond the lower mediastinum, though this
 could be due to technical factors.  If clinically indicated, dedicated
 radiographs centered in the lower mediastinum/diaphragms could help for
 further assessment.
