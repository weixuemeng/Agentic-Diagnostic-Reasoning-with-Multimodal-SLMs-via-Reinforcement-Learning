                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dementia, failure to thrive  // Evaluate for
 evidence of pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is severely rotated, limiting evaluation.  The left costophrenic
 angle not fully included on the image.  Given this, the cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  Difficult to exclude small right
 pleural effusion.  Left base opacity could be due to atelectasis, but
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study due to severe patient rotation.  Additionally, the left
 costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Given the above, mild
 left base opacity could be due to atelectasis, but infection is not excluded
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  Difficult to exclude a small right
 pleural effusion.  Stable appearing cardiomediastinal silhouette.
