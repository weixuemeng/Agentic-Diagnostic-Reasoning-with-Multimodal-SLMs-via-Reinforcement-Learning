                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // eval for hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum
 may relate today AP portable technique low lung volumes and unfolded aorta
 however, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CT
 is more sensitive.  Bilateral perihilar opacities are concerning for vascular
 congestion.  Patchy right basilar opacities are seen with differential
 diagnosis including infection, aspiration, an atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
