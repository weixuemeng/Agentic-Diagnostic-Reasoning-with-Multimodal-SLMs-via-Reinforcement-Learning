                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis.  Evaluate possible
 interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Fine reticulation at the lung bases most readily appreciated on the lateral
 view could be an interstitial abnormality related to rheumatoid arthritis or
 might be unrelated.  There is also the suggestion of mild bronchiectasis in
 the right mid lung zone with similar alternative explanations.  There is no
 evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No focal evidence of infection
 or malignancy.  Heart size is normal.  There is no indication of central lymph
 node enlargement.
 
 More definitive depiction of the state of the lungs would be afforded by
 conventional (not high resolution) chest CT scanning.
