                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMH significant for CAD s/p stent x3, PVD s/p subclavian
 stent and LUE stent, HTN, HLD, asthma/COPD, anxiety/depression, and GERD who
 is transferred from ___ for NSTEMI. Continues to be wheezy, very SOB 
 // Interval assessment r/o consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  Possible
 minimal atelectasis at both lung bases.  No pneumothorax.
 
 There is a faint curvilinear density in the right cardiophrenic region, which
 may represent artifact due to overlying structures.  Incidental note is made
 of fusion hardware in the lower cervical spine.
 
 There is a small density adjacent to the greater tuberosity, question calcium
 hydroxyapatite/calcific tendinitis.  The differential diagnosis could include
 a osteophyte.  This may have been present on the chest x-ray from ___, where it is noted at the edge of the film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process.  No CHF,  focal consolidation, or effusion.
 
 Faint curvilinear density in the right cardiophrenic region, not fully
 characterized.  Question artifact due to overlying structures.  Recommend
 further assessment with PA and lateral chest x-rays.
 
 Suspected calcium hydroxyapatite/calcific tendinitis of the left shoulder.  In
 the absence of relevant symptoms at the left shoulder, this is of limited
 clinical significance.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Faint curvilinear density in the right cardiophrenic
 region, not fully characterized.  Question artifact due to overlying
 structures.  Recommend further assessment with PA and lateral chest x-rays,
 obtained with good inspiratory effort.
