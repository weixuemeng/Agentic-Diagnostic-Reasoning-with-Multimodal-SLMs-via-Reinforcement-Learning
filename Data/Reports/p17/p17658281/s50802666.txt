 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules on
 CT are not well assessed on the current exam. Lungs are clear. Trace left
 pleural effusion is similar compared to the prior CT and chest radiograph. No
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Trace left pleural effusion appears chronic.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormality otherwise demonstrated. Known pulmonary nodules are better
 assessed on the previous CT.
