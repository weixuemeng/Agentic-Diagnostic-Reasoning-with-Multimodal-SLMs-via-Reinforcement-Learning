                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded. 
 There is an airspace opacity in the anterior right upper lobe with air
 bronchograms.  Medial depression of the adjacent minor fissure suggests the
 possibility of a central mass.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right upper lobe pneumonia.  Followup imaging after treatment in ___ weeks is
 essential to confirm resolution and exclude a central obstructing mass.
