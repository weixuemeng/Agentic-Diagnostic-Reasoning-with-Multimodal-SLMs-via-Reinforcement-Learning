 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a positive PPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has improved.  Combination of mediastinal fat and
 possible middle lobe atelectasis should not be mistaken for pneumonia.  Lungs
 are otherwise clear.  There may be a very small new right pleural effusion. 
 Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but not focally aneurysmal.  No
 evidence of tuberculosis.
