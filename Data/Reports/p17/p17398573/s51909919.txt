 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are seen in the left lung base,
 potentially atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 Streaky atelectasis is also demonstrated in the left lung base.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
