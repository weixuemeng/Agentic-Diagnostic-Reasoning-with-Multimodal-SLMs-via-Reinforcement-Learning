                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumonia, sepsis and
 transferred from outside hospital.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  As compared to the prior study, there
 are diffuse parenchymal opacities, bilateral, mainly in the periphery and also
 low lung fields.  Differential diagnosis would include multifocal pneumonia. 
 Element of interstitial edema is a possibility given distention of the azygos
 vein and some perihilar nature of the finding.  That most likely is a
 combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.
