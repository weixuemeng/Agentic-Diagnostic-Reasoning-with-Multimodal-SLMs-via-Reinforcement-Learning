                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with nasogastric tube for tube feeds from outside
 hospital.  Evaluate NG tube position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Nasogastric tube is
 looped several times within the stomach.  Cholecystectomy clips in the right
 upper quadrant are unchanged.  Lung volumes are extremely low, exaggerating
 bronchovascular markings.  Diffuse heterogeneous parenchymal opacities are
 consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is bilateral lower lung atelectasis
 and a small right pleural effusion.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  NG tube is looped several times within the stomach.  
 
 2.  Very low lung volumes with diffuse parenchymal opacities, improved since
 the prior exam, consistent with either pulmonary edema or fibrosis.
