 FINDINGS:  omparison is made to prior radiographs from ___.
 
 There is improved aeration of the left retrocardiac area.  However, there is
 interval development of increased opacity at the right lung base medially
 projecting over the right medial heart border.  This may represent developing
 pneumonia.  There is increased density in this region on the lateral view.
 Heart size is within normal limits.  There is no pulmonary edema.  There are
 no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.  There is calcification at the
 insertion of longitudinal ligament consistent with DISH.
