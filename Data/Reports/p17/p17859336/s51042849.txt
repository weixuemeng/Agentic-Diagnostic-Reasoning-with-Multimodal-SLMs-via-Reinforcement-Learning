                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Readmission for small bowel obstruction, now with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the previously described
 pulmonary nodules appear stable.  There is some increased opacification at the
 left base in the retrocardiac region.  Although the appearance most likely
 suggests atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
