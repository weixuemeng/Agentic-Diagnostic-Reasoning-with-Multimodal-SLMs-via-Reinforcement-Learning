                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PPM implant  // PTX, leads      PTX, leads
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 dual-channel pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the
 right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax.
 There is again some prominence of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with
 previous CABG procedure and intact midline sternal wires. However, no
 appreciable vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Blunting of the left
 hemidiaphragm could reflect either small effusion or pleural thickening.
