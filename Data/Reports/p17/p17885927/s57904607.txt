                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some asymmetry
 with increased opacification in the left mid and lower zones.  Much of this
 could reflect merely atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Of incidental note is an old healed fracture of the distal right clavicle.
