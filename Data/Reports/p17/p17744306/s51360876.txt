                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD  // SOB, minor O2 demand
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is free intra peritoneal air visible under the right hemidiaphragm. This
 is consistent with patient's known recent laparoscopic intra-abdominal
 surgery.
 
 Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are again seen
 in stable position.  There are low lung volumes are poor inspiratory effort.
 Allowing for changes due to inspiratory effort differences, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral hila are normal.
 
 There is an increase in retrocardiac radiodensity, which likely represents
 left basilar atelectasis, however, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 pneumonia or sequela of aspiration are also considerations. There is likely
 right basilar atelectasis. There probably are minimal bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.
 There are no pneumothoraces. .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small amount of free intraperitoneal air consistent with known recent
 laparoscopy.
 2. Increased retrocardiac density, potentially representing left basilar
 atelectasis, or possibly sequela of aspiration or developing pneumonia.
 3.  Right basilar atelectasis and probable new minimal bilateral pleural
 effusions.
