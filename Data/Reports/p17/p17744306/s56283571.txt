 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ approach hemodialysis catheter has been placed in the interim with
 the tip projecting over the expected region of the low SVC.  Catheter
 projecting over the right lateral hemi thorax limits detailed evaluation of
 the parenchyma in this region.  The lungs otherwise are clear.  No focal
 consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Surgical clips
 projecting over the right upper abdomen are unchanged.

 1.  Interval placed right IJ approach hemodialysis catheter tip projects over
 the expected region of the low SVC.
 2.  No focal pneumonia or edema.
