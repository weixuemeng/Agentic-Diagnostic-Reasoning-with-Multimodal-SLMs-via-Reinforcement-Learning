 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w hx ESRD ___ NIDDM, HTN now s/p living unrelated renal
 transplant c/b ureteral thrombosis now s/p take-back revision ureteral
 anastomosis  now 2 days postop with desat and chest pain  // assess for
 pulmonary edema    assess for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there again are low lung
 volumes in this patient with intact midline sternal wires and hemodialysis
 catheter in place.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or
 mildly enlarged, but there is no evidence of appreciable pulmonary edema.  . 
 Increased opacification at the right base medially could merely represent
 atelectatic changes or some crowding of pulmonary vessels.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously
 considered.
