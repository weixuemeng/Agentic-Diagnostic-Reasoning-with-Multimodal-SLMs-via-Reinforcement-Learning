 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with posterior circulation stroke now with cough 
 // ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.

 There is mild hyperinflation.  The trachea is central.  The cardiomediastinal
 contour is within normal limits.  The heart is not enlarged. No pleural
 effusion, consolidation or pneumothorax seen.  There is a 9 mm opacity
 projecting over the left sixth rib anteriorly.  This is not clearly seen on
 the prior study and may reflect a lesion within the rib raw low no true
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.  Suggest oblique views of the ribs
 initially to better localize.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.  A 9 mm opacity projecting over the
 left sixth rib may be within the bone rather than within the pulmonary
 parenchyma.  Recommend oblique rib views initially to further evaluate.
