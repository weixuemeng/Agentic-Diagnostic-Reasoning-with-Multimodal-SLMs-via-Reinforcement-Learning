                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist, the patient was unable to lift arms for lhe ateral
 image. The lateral image is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  Please
 note that initially, the image was mislabeled; the right is actually the left.
 Large-bore left-sided dialysis catheter is again seen, unchanged in position,
 terminating in the right atrium/cavoatrial junction.  There is mild central
 pulmonary edema, significantly decreased as compared to the prior study.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen, although trace pleural effusion would be
 difficult to exclude, particularly on the right.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  There has been interval removal of a right-sided
 PICC.  Apparent narrowing of the trachea approximately 7.7 cm above the level
 of the carina may be artifactual as this was not seen on the chest radiograph
