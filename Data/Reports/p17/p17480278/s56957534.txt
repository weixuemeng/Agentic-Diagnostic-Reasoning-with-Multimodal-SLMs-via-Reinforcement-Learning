                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chest pain after falling, evaluate for
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette including mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Left
 lower lung opacities are mild atelectasis or aspiration.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No displaced rib
 fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.
 
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis or aspiration.
 
 3.  No discrete fracture is identified; however, please note that conventional
 chest radiography is not sensitive for detection of rib fractures. Detail
 views of focal findings, radiographically marked, recommended if detection is
 clinically indicated.
