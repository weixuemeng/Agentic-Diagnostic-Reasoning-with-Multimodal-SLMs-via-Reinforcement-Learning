                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  End-stage renal disease on
 hemodialysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are bilateral
 parenchymal opacities identified and a small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged.  Calcification in the
 region of the right hilum could represent a calcified lymph node.  Dual-lumen
 central venous line is seen with tip in the right atrium.  Additional
 right-sided central line is seen with tip in the mid SVC.  Osseous and soft
 tissue structures are notable for inferior subluxation of the right humeral
 head with respect to the glenoid which is incompletely characterized on this
 exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities and right effusion. 
 Overall, suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.  Component of infection is
 also possible and clinical correlation is suggested.
