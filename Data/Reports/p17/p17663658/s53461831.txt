                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST of ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable radiograph of earlier the same date and multiple
 previous chest radiographs and CT scans dating between ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The course of the right internal jugular central venous catheter is
 similar to that observed on the radiograph of earlier the same date, with
 persistent medial course of the catheter beginning at the level of the
 inferior aspect of the clavicle and extending just below the tracheobronchial
 angle.  On the lateral view, the catheter is located approximately 2.3 cm
 anterior to the anterior margin of the trachea, which is the approximate
 distance from the trachea to the superior vena cava at this level on prior
 neck CT, which included part of the chest.  The location on the lateral view
 is not consistent with previous concern of potential placement into the
 internal mammary vein.  Slight widening of the mediastinum is consistent with
 prominent mediastinal fat on prior neck CT of ___.  The heart size
 is normal.  Lungs are clear and there are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent unusual medial course of right internal jugular
 central venous catheter, which courses more medially than a previous right
 internal jugular venous catheter present on prior chest x-rays and CT scans in
 ___.  Position on lateral view excludes internal mammary vein location
 and suggests a central venous location, but inadvertent arterial placement
 cannot be excluded.
