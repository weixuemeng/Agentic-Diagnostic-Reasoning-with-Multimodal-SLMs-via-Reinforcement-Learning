                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath. Evaluate for heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse interstitial opacities with engorgement of the central
 vasculature, compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are best appreciated on the lateral view. A more focal
 opacity in the right upper lobe is likely asymmetric edema. The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  No pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome
 for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly and small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 2. Focal opacity in the right upper lobe is likely asymmetric edema, however,
 followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended to exclude an secondary
 process such as infection and less likely neoplasm.
  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ telephone on
 ___ at 7:51 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
