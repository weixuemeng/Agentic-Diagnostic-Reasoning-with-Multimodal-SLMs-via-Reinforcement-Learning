  1. Interval improvement in now mild pulmonary edema. Previously described
  right upper lobe opacity has cleared, and likely represented asymmetric
  pulmonary edema.
  2. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with pulmonary edema, prior same-day chest
 x-ray suggestive of.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral projections, upright positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest x-ray obtained at 06:01.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from same day, there has been interval
 improvement in centrally predominant engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature
 along with diffuse interstitial prominence, reflecting improvement in now mild
 pulmonary edema status post diuresis. The previously described focal opacity
 within the right upper lobe has cleared, and is no longer apparent, and likely
 represented asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 There is no focal lung consolidation. There are unchanged bilateral small
 pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval improvement in now mild pulmonary edema.  Previously described
 right upper lobe opacity has cleared, and likely represented asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.
 2. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
