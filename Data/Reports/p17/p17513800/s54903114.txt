                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal contour is similar
 with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted.  Bilateral hilar
 enlargement is unchanged likely reflective of enlargement of the pulmonary
 arteries and suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacity in the left lung base likely
 reflects atelectasis, without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Compression deformity in the upper lumbar spine is
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left patchy opacity, likely atelectasis.  Unchanged bilateral pulmonary artery
 enlargement suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
