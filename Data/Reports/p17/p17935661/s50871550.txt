  Pneumoperitoneum not unexpected given recent intra-abdominal surgical
  procedure.  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No definite pleural
  effusion noted.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent though this is
  likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.  No evidence of fluid overload.
