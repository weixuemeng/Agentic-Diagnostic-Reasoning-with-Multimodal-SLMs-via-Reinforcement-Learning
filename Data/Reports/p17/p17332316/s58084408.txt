  A left-sided PICC terminates within the right atrium and should be pulled back
  approximately 4 cm for appropriate positioning. Prominence of the bilateral
  hila, right greater than left may be related to pulmonary vascular engorgement
  and mild edema. Subtle blurring of the right heart border could represent some
  focal consolidation/possible infection within the right middle lobe. No
  pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with neutropenic fever  // pneumonia     
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 18:55 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall cardiac an mediastinal contours are stable. Left subclavian PICC line
 continues to have its tip in the right atrium. Streaky opacity at the right
 base may reflect an early pneumonia or patchy atelectasis. Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging may be helpful.  No pneumothorax.
 No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
