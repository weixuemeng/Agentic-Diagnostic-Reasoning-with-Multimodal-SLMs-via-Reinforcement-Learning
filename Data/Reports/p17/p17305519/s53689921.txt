                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Increased respiratory distress.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the study from the prior day, the prominence of
 bilateral hila are again seen.  On study, these are described as likely
 pulmonary vasculature, but correlation with prior imaging or CT would be
 helpful to exclude mass.  There is some minimal pulmonary vascular
 redistribution.  There is a small right effusion.  There is volume loss at
 left base that is increased slightly compared to prior.
