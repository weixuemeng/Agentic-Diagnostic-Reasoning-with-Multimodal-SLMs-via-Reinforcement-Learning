                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating about
 4 cm above the carina.  Allowing for low lung volumes and supine positioning,
 there is otherwise no relevant change in the appearance of the chest since the
 recent study of a few hours earlier.
