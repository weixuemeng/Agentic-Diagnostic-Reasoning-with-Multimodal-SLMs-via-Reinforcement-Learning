                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with syncope s/p ICD implant  // evaluate for
 pneumothorax and lead placement      evaluate for pneumothorax and lead
 placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 dual-channel ICD device through the left subclavian approach with leads
 extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. Specifically,
 no evidence of pneumothorax, though there is some apical pleural thickening on
 the left. Some elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour is seen with
 blunting of the costophrenic angle.  This could relate to tenting related to
 previous inflammatory changes at the left base with pleural effusion or
 thickening.  The right lung is essentially clear.
