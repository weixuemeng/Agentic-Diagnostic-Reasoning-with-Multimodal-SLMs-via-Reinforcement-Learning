                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with postoperative fever. Status post partial left
 pneumonectomy in the distant past.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous.
 Mediastinal contour is otherwise unchanged. There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.  Small left pleural
 effusion appears chronic. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Small right
 pleural effusion is new in the interval.  No pneumothorax is present. There
 are mild degenerative changes noted diffusely within the imaged thoraco umbar
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar nonspecific airspace opacities,
 possibly atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions, with the left pleural effusion appearing chronic.
