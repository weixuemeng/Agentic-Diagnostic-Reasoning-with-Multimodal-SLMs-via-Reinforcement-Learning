 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  SOB, BIBASILAR RALES
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and
 unchanged pacer device.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular
 congestion, or pleural effusion.  Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening hemidiaphragms is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
