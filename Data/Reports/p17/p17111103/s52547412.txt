                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new BIV pacemaker upgrade  // evaluate for
 pneumothorax and lead placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the now available lateral radiograph
 shows that the opacity seen on the previous image is caused by the combination
 of a mild to moderate right pleural effusion and the subsequent basilar
 atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. 
 The leads are in expected position, in the right atrium and the right
 ventricle.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persists.
