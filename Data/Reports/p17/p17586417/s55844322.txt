                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Necrotizing pancreatitis status post decompressive laparotomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large bilateral layering pleural effusions are improved
 from prior study with decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette and decreased
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis is
 improved.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
 mid to low SVC, as does a left subclavian central venous catheter.  An upper
 enteric tube is in place with the tip out of view; however, is coiled
 proximally in the hypopharynx.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improving bilateral layering pleural effusions with decreased vascular
 engorgement:
 2.  Upper enteric tube is coiled in the hypopharynx.
