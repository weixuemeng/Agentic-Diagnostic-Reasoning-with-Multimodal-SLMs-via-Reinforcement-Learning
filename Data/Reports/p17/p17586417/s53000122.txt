                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates within the proximal right main
 bronchus, and has subsequently been repositioned above this level on a
 separately dictated chest radiograph performed approximately 20 minutes later.
 Tip of central venous catheter terminates deep within the right atrium, near
 the expected junction with the inferior vena cava.  This has also been
 repositioned on the short-term followup radiograph.  Tip of nasogastric tube
 terminates within the distal stomach.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the
 cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Linear foci of atelectasis
 are present in both lower lobes.  No pneumothorax is evident on this supine
 radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Malpositioned endotracheal tube and central venous catheter, both of which
 have been repositioned on subsequently dictated short-term followup radiograph
 dictated separately under clip ___.
