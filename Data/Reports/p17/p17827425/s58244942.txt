                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for cause of worsening hypoxia in patient with
 metastatic lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and older studies dating back
 to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate multiple
 bilateral pulmonary masses, consistent with the patient's history of
 metastatic disease.  There has been markedly rapid growth of these masses
 between ___ and the current study.  There is no evidence of
 underlying lung consolidation or pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax,
 and a small left pleural effusion appears unchanged.  The hilar and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Metastatic lung cancer without evidence of underlying acute
 process.  Stable small left pleural effusion.
