 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. 
 As before, volume loss in left hemithorax with elevation of left
 hemidiaphragm, pleural scar formations and thickening in the apical area
 appear as before.  No significant interval change can be identified. 
 Mediastinal structures in stable midline position.  Right-sided hemithorax
