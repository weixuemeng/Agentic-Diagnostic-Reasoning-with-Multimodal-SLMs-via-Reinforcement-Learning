                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS of ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___.  
 
 FINDINGS: The patient is status post left upper lobe resection and radiation
 therapy.  Stable postoperative and post-treatment changes in the left
 hemithorax, with marked volume loss manifested by leftward shift of the
 cardiomediastinal structures and elevation of left hemidiaphragm.  Left-sided
 pleural opacification in the apical and basilar regions is again demonstrated.
 At the left base, this is associated with increased lateral blunting of the
 left costophrenic sulcus.  Based upon the configuration of left hemidiaphragm
 contour and increased distance between apparent left hemidiaphragm contour and
 gastric bubble, there may be a subpulmonic component to this effusion.  Right
 lung is slightly overexpanded but grossly clear, and there is no evidence of
 right pleural effusion.  Left thoracotomy changes are again demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left pleural effusion, with likely subpulmonic
 component.  A left lateral decubitus radiograph could be considered to better
 quantify the amount of pleural fluid if warranted clinically.
