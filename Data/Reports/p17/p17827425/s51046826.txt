                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  History of lung cancer status post a
 partial lobectomy.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.  Multiple chest
 radiographs dating back to ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post a left upper lobectomy with associated
 volume loss, scarring, and tracheal deviation to the left.  This is stable in
 comparison to the prior radiograph on ___.  There are multiple
 bilateral rounded nodular opacities, predominantly at the bases.  In
 comparison to the prior radiograph on ___, the number of these
 opacities have increased, particularly on the right.  Given how well defined
 these nodules are, this is concerning for widespread metastatic disease.  No
 definite pneumonia is identified, but given the underlying parenchymal
 abnormalities, it cannot be completely excluded.  There is no pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  No compression fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Numerous bilateral nodules consistent with metastatic disease; it is hard
 to compare directly to the prior examination for small changes, noting
 different technique, but there is no definite change from a very recent study
 from ___. 
 
 2.  No definite pneumonia, although in the setting of a background of diffuse
 lung abnormalities, a small pneumonia cannot be completely excluded.
 
 3.  Stable post-operative changes status post a left upper lobectomy.
