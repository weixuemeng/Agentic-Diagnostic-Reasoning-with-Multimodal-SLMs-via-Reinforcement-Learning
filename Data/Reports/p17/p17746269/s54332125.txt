                                 FINAL REPORT

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___ performed at 16:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been an interval increase in the moderate to severe parenchymal
 opacities, predominately at the lung bases bilaterally, and bilateral
 perihilar region. There has been interval progression of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Widening of the upper mediastinum, at the region of the
 thoracic inlet, is unchanged compared to the prior exam given differences in
 acquisition technique.  Note is made of bibasilar atelectasis. There is no
 pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.

 1. Worsening moderate to severe pulmonary edema, and moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.
 
 2. Left lower lobe atelectasis. A superimposed infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
