 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with AF  // eval for volume overload      eval
 for volume overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with a earlier study of this date, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The degree of pulmonary vascular
 congestion appears to have slightly reduced. Continued bilateral pleural
 effusions more prominent on the right with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases.
 There is suggestion of an impression on the upper thoracic trachea on the
 right.  There is unclear whether this is a true finding and this area should
 be checked on subsequent radiographs.
