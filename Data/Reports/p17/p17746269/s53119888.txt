 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  There is continued evidence for
 pulmonary vascular congestion and a left pleural effusion. Left pleural fluid
 has redistributed. Underlying parenchymal consolidation would be difficult to
 exclude. A pigtail catheter has been withdrawn on the right.  Allowing for
 differences in patient positioning, mediastinal structures are probably
 stable.  A PICC remains in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No definite, significant change post withdrawal of the right chest tube.
