                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Previously described right lower lung opacity has resolved. 
 Bilateral upper lobe predominant fibronodular opacities are unchanged and
 likely due to chronic changes of sarcoid.  Heart size is normal.  Prominence
 of the pulmonary hila is unchanged and suggestive of lymphadenopathy.  There
 are no pleural effusions or acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolution of right lower lobe opacity which may have been due to
 an infectious pneumonia.  Hilar lymphadenopathy and upper lobe predominant
 interstitial abnormalities are unchanged and suggestive of sarcoidosis.
