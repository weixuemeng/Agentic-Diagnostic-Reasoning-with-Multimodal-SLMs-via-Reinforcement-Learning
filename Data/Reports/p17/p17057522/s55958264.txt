                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right-sided chest pain, sore throat, cough.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are well
 expanded.  There is an area of increased opacity at the right lung base which
 is concerning for an infectious process. Streaky opacity at the left lung base
 is likely atelectasis. There is prominence of the hila in keeping with
 lymphadenopathy and known diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Worsening apical opacities
 in the apices could reflect worsening sarcoidosis. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. New increased opacity at the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia. 
 Short interval followup is recommended after treatment to document resolution.
 
 
 2. Biapical apical opacities are progressed and could reflect worsening
 sarcoidosis. 
 
 Findings discussed with ___ via telephone by ___ on
