                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fever, weakness  // please evaluate for abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  There is right basilar opacity overlying the hemidiaphragm, not
 well assessed.  Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip projecting
 over the right atrium.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within
 normal limits for portable technique.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  Right basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis although
 infection or aspiration are possible.  Consider PA and lateral films for more
 complete assessment.
