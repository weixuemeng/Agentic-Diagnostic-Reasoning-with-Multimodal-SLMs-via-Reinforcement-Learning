                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of
 overinflation have increased.  There is unchanged symmetrically bilateral
 apical thickening.  The known nodular densities, predominating in the right
 upper lobe and associated with findings of right upper lobe volume loss are
 likely caused by the prior granulomatous infection.  On the current
 radiograph, there is no indication for an acute lung parenchymal pathology. 
 No pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal hilar
 and mediastinal structures, with the exception of the upward pulling of the
 right hilus.
