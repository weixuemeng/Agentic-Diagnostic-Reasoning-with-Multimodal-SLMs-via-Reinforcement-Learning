                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Three weeks of cough, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is
 noted.  Lateral symmetrical apical thickening with minimal scarring at the
 right lung apex, and, potentially, the presence of minimal bilateral apical
 calcified granulomas.  As a consequence of these changes, there is mild
 bilateral displacement of the hilar structures cranially.
 
 No acute or recent lung parenchymal changes, in particular no evidence of
 pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
