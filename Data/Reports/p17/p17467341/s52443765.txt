                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New tracheostomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 removal of the endotracheal tube and insertion of a tracheostomy, which
 appears to be well positioned without evidence of pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax.  Areas of increased opacification persist at the right base. 
 Although most likely related to atelectasis, the possibility of aspiration or
 even infectious pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
