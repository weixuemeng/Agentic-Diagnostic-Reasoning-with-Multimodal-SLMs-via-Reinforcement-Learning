                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 1:37
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent aspiration status post bilateral
 chest tubes with removal of the left chest tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 12:03
 a.m.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 1:38 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina.  There is a
 nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the
 stomach.  A right chest tube remains in place.  There has been interval
 removal of the left chest tube.  There is a diffuse bilateral airspace process
 which would be concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration given the
 patient's recent history of trauma.  Pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia
 would be less likely.  A linear lucency at the right apex may reflect the
 known small right apical pneumothorax, although given supine technique, this
 would be an unusual position and therefore, this suggests that it may be
 loculated.  No large effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No large left pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Avulsion fracture
 of the right humeral greater tuberosity confirmed and raises concern for
 rotator cuff injury.  Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___
 on ___ by phone at 9:55 a.m. at the time of discovery.
