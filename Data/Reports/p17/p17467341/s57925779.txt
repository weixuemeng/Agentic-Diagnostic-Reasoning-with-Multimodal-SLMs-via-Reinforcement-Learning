                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma 
 
 COMPARISON:  Susequent Torso CT
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP views of the chest and pelvis were obtained.  This exam is limited by the
 overlying trauma board.  The lungs are well expanded.  A small right apical
 pneumothorax was better seen on susequent chest CT. Chest tubes are present
 bilaterally. The endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina. Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are normal. There is a bilateral pattern of airspace
 opacities in the lungs which may reflect pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary
 contusion, or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised.  In addition,
 there is a lucency projecting over the greater tuberosity of the right humeral
 head raising concern for an avulsion fracture.  This can be better assessed on
 follow up imaging.
 
 Pelvis: There is no displaced pelvic fracture or malalignment. There is no
 degenerative disease. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral airspace opacities for which clinical correlation is advised. Small
 right apical pneumothorax.  Probable avulsion fracture of greater tuberosity
 of right humeral head.
