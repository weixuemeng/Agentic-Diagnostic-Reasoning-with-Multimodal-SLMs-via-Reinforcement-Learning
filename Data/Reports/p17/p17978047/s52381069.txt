                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and congestion.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ AP chest radiograph and ___ PA and lateral
 chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly and a calcified aorta are again seen.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated, and central pulmonary arteries remain prominent.  Thin linear
 opacities at the lateral left base on the PA view are similar to prior,
 compatible with atelectasis or scarring.  There is no evidence for pulmonary
 consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There are
 degenerative changes and dextroconvex scoliosis in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearance of the chest without evidence for acute abnormalities.
