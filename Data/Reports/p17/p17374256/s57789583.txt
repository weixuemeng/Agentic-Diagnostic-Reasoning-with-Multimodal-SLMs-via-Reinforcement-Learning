 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of CABG, increased shortness of breath.  Chronic heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed.  The left pectoral pacemaker is in unchanged
 position.  Lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved
 ventilation.  A band-like area of parenchymal opacity at the right lung base
 persists.  Unchanged minimal bilateral pleural effusions.
