                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,
 here to assess for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph last performed on ___, with
 multiple prior chest radiographs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased interstitial markings and increased size of
 small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right.  The
 left lower lobe is opacified and consolidation cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is engorged, which is new
 from the prior study.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with the
 inferior-most sternal wire broken, but alignment is preserved.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged with calcified aortic knob and descending
 thoracic aorta, unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with marked
 tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  A left pectoral dual-lead pacemaker is
 unchanged in position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle as well as epicardial leads implanted in the cardiac apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions, greater on the left than the right, suggesting heart failure. 
 Possible new left lower lobe pneumonia.
