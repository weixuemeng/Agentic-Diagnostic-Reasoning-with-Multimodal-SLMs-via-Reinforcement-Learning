                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal, and mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with attenuation of upper lobe vessels
 suggesting the presence of emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease.  New patchy opacity has developed in the left infrahilar region, and
 lungs otherwise appear clear.  No pleural effusion.  Compression deformity
 with sclerosis in the mid thoracic spine as well as additional mild
 compression deformity at the thoracolumbar junction appear unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New patchy left infrahilar opacity concerning for possible
 pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
