                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with cough, wheezing on right base. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 normal.  The patient is status post surgical intervention for a traumatic
 aortic injury with following pseudoaneurysm.  Multiple surgical clips around
 the area of the aortic arch.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no
 new acute infiltrates can be identified.  The previously described mild
 elevation of the left-sided hemidiaphragm and blunted lateral pleural sinus is
 again noted.  Comparison on the lateral view suggests that increasing scar
 formations have occurred, but there is no evidence of new acute free pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pneumonia.  Comparison with previous
 examination indicates that the prominence of the aortic pseudoaneurysm has
 increased slightly.  Referring physician, ___. ___ was contacted by
 telephone at 1:45 p.m.  Increasing prominence of previously described
 pseudoaneurysm warrants followup with CT angiography or consultation with
 surgical team performed initial repair after trauma.
