                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with productive cough and leukocytosis, postop day 2
 status post VHR.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest show an ovoid calcific mass at
 the level of the aortic arch corresponding to partially calcified
 pseudoaneurysm.  Some blunting of the left costophrenic angle and elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm and pleural thickening are unchanged compared to the
 patient's preoperative film and may be related to known prior surgery in the
 left hemithorax.  New on today's study is obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm which appears related to both some pleural fluid and some
 consolidation in the right middle lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right effusion and right basilar/middle lobe consolidation
 which could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia.
