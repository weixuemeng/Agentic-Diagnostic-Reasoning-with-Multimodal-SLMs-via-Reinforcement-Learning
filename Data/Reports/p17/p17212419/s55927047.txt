  New right pigtail catheter projects over the inferior right pleural space. 
  Increased subtle right lower lung heterogeneous opacities could be atelectasis
  versus mild parenchymal hemorrhage related to the known pseudoaneurysm
  associated with a likely neoplasm in the superior segment of the right lower
  lobe.  No definite pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with lung cancer and right chest tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Cardiac size is top-normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Small right pleural
 effusion has improved.  Residual opacities are likely atelectasis in the right
 lower lobe.  There is a right basal chest tube.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or left pleural effusion.  Mediastinal, hilar
 lymphadenopathy and right lower lobe mass are better seen on prior CT from
 ___.
