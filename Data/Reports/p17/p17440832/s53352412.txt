                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is some bibasilar atelectasis with a prosthetic aortic stent in
 place and right IJ catheter.  There is some asymmetry at the bases with more
 opacification on the right.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 conceivably represent developing consolidation.
