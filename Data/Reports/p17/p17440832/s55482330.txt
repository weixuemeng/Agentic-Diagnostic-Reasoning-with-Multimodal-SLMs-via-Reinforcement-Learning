                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  TEVAR with worsening dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change
 other than slightly lower lung volumes.  The aortic stent and right IJ
 catheter remain in place.  Areas of increased opacification at the bases most
 likely represent atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
