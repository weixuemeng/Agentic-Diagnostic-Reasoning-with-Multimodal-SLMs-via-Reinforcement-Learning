                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with STEMI, now with leukocytosis and low-grade temps.  Rule
 out infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 The lungs are fully expanded and clear. The heart size is normal.  Widening of
 the right paratracheal stripe may reflect mediastinal adenopathy.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe may
 indicate mediastinal adenopathy.  CT scan may be performed for further
 confirmation and diagnosis if clincially relevant.
