                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.  History of stroke and congestive heart
 failure, presenting also with bibasilar crackles.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is a small
 left-sided pleural effusion, which appears increased, with patchy left basilar
 opacity which also appears increased.  A small suspected right-sided pleural
 effusion appears unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature shows upper zone
 redistribution and appears indistinct but findings suggesting parenchymal
 edema have continued to improve.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Small but increased left-sided pleural effusion; associated opacity is
 probably compatible with atelectasis although infectious process not excluded.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion, but with continued
 improvement.
