                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is top normal. There is bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and
 peribronchial cuffing compatible with pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. No strong evidence for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings are compatible with pulmonary edema, with no pleural effusion. 
 Infection could potentially be obscured by edema, thus re-assessment after
 diuresis is recommended.
