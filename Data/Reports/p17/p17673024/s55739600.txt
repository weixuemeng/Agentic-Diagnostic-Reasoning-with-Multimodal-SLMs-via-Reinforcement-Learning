 crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiac
 silhouette appears top-normal in size. There are diffuse interstitial
 opacities greater on the right than the left with blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles consistent with small pleural effusions. No acute osseous
 abnormality is detected.
