                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p ORIF R femur now w/ fever and leukocytosis 
 // r/p PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A pacer is seen in the left anterior chest with intact leads in adequate
 position.  Median sternotomy wires and artificial valve are noted.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but demonstrate slightly decreased volumes
 compared to prior exams and mild bronchovascular crowding, likely reflecting
 suboptimal inspiratory effort.  Diffuse reticular opacities are seen
 bilaterally, consistent with known emphysematous changes in the lungs.  There
 is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No consolidative opacity suggestive of
 pneumonia is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 findings.
 
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs and diffuse reticular opacities, consistent with
 emphysema.
