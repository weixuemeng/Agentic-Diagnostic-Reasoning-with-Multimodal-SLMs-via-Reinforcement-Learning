                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset productive cough, crackles,
 finished recent course for cap  // r/o pna vs pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 3 days earlier, pulmonary edema has
 decreased in severity with residual interstitial edema remaining.  The small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear similar with adjacent bibasilar
 opacities.  A focus of consolidation medially at the right lung base could
 potentially represent a site of infectious pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
