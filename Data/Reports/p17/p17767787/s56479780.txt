                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and with subjective worsening shortness
 of breath  // r/o new consolidation      r/o new consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  Cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged and, allowing for slightly lower lung volumes, there
 is probably little change in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.
 At the left base, there is suggestion of a more coalescent area that, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, could reflect developing consolidation.
