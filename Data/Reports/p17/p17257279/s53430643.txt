 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Swan-Ganz catheter, aortic balloon pump.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:08 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 3 cm above
 the carina.  The course and the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is unremarkable,
 but the catheter should be pulled back by approximately 2 cm, as the tip
 projects over the rather distal parts of the right pulmonary artery.  Moderate
 pulmonary edema is unchanged, moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  No pleural
 effusions.
