 This is unchanged.  The ET tube has been removed and the lung volumes are low.
 There is increasing obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and less prominent
 on the left concerning for bilateral effusions.  An NG tube is identified with
 its tip in the stomach.  Crowding of the vasculature may also represent low
 lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The ET tube has been removed and the lung volumes are thus low. 
 Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm bilaterally may be due to atelectasis is
 worsening compared to prior examination.  There could be some element of
