                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach but the side port is just distal to the EG
 junction.  It can be advanced couple of centimeters.  Enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is stable.  There is mild vascular congestion.  No
 pulmonary edema and no pleural effusion.  ET tube is in standard position. 
 Intra-aortic balloon is in unchanged position.  It could be withdrawn 1.5 cm
 for more standard position.
