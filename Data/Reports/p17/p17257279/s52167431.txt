 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation after arrest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates at the
 thoracic inlet approximately 7 cm above the carina.  Advancing the tube by
 approximately 3 cm could be considered for more optimal positioning.  The
 heart is moderate to severely enlarged with a globular configuration. 
 Perihilar fullness suggests mild vascular congestion but otherwise the lungs
 appear clear.  Although the left costophrenic sulcus is not entirely included,
 there is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Striking cardiomegaly; true cardiac enlargement or the possibility of a
 pericardial effusion, or perhaps both, could be considered.
 
 2.  Prominent main pulmonary artery contour.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
 
 4.  Status post endotracheal intubation, with relatively high lying
 endotracheal tube, which could be advanced by approximately 3 cm for more
 optimal positioning, if clinically indicated.
