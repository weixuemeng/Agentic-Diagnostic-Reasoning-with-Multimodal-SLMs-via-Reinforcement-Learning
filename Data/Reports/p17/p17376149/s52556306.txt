                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest. Low lung volumes, which accentuate
 bronchovascular markings and cardiomediastinal contours.   The mediastinum is
 slightly widened in the region of the aortic knob and aorticopulmonary window.
 Heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Right hemidiaphragm
 is slightly elevated.  There is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or
 pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. On the lateral
 view, the normally clear retrosternal space is not well visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widened mediastinum, possibly due to accentuation by  low lung volumes, but a
 discrete mass or acute mediastinal process cannot be excluded. Repeat chest
 radiographs are recommended with improved respiratory effort.  Chest CT may
 also be considered.
