                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with alcohol intoxication and fall.  Probable
 upper lobe bullae seen on cervical spine CT.  
 
 Correlation to cervical spine CT from ___ at 02:00.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL:  Large bullae are seen in the upper lobes, left
 greater than right.  These have well-defined, thin walls, with convex margins
 that are uncharacteristic of pneumothorax.
 
 In the right lower lobe, there is a cluster of hyperdense nodules, which may
 represent calcifications or mucus-impacted bronchi.  Left lung is clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There are no pleural
 effusions.  
 
 A small hiatal hernia is present.  Clips in the left upper quadrant are likely
 from Nissen fundoplication.  There is no free air beneath the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral upper lobe bullae, left greater than right.
 2.  Right lower lobe aspiration versus calcified nodules.
