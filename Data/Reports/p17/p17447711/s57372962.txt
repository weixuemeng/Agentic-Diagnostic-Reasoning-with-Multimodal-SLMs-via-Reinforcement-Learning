                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post mitral valve repair with fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A central venous catheter has been removed.  The patient is status
 post mitral valve replacement.  The heart is again moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a new moderate
 interstitial abnormality most consistent with moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  Given the
 history of fever, the possibility of diffuse atypical pneumonia could also be
 considered clinically.  Short-term followup radiographs would be helpful to
 reassess.
