                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with possible endocarditis, cough and fever,
 assess for pneumonia or lung abscess.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CTU from ___.
 
 AP upright and lateral radiographs were obtained.  Right basal opacities on
 the current examination have the appearance of linear atelectasis; however,
 note is made that the recent CT suggested the possibility of right basal
 pneumonia or changes of infarction.  Since the prior chest radiographs, lung
 volumes are decreased given the appearance of bronchovascular congestion.  The
 heart size is likely normal.  Trace right pleural effusion was seen as well on
 the prior CT. No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basal opacities appear to reflect atelectasis though
 pneumonia is an alternative consideration.
