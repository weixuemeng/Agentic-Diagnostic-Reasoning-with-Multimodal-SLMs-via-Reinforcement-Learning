                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with mitral valve
 regurgitation and endocarditis, preoperative assessment before mitral valve
 surgery.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, but this may be related to the portable character of
 this study.  Splenomegaly is noted, also assessed on the recent CT abdomen. 
 Lungs are clear except for minimal bibasal atelectasis.  No appreciable
 pleural effusion is seen.  Upper zone redistribution of the vasculature is
 noted and might be consistent with presence of mitral regurgitation.
