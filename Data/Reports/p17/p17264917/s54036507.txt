                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with vomiting and diarrhea.  Assess
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs
 are clear, though hyperinflated.  There is a retrocardiac density containing
 an air-fluid level compatible with known hiatal hernia.  A calcified nodule in
 the right mid-to-lower lung is compatible with a calcified granuloma.  No
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The aortic knob calcification is again
 noted.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known hiatal hernia redemonstrated.  No acute intrathoracic
 process.
