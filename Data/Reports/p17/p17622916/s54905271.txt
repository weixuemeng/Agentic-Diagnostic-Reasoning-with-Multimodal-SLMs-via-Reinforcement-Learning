                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, status post Whipple, extubated with some
 shortness of breath and wheezing. Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, patient
 has been extubated, and there are lower lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities
 have increased, likely reflecting a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  However, an underlying early infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  Right IJ central venous catheter tip lies at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube extends into the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities which likely reflect a combination
 of pleural fluid and volume loss.  However, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, an underlying early infectious process cannot be excluded.
