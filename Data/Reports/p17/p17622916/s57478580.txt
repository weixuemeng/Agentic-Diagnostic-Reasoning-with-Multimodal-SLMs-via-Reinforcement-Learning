                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with biliary obstruction.  Evaluate the chest
 prior to admission.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chest, PA and lateral.  The lung volumes are low causing crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature at the bases.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours
 are normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Crowding of vasculature at the bases due to low lung volumes makes it
 difficult to differentiate between microatelectasis and mild interstitial
 abnormality.
