                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a recent chest x-ray showing a left
 infiltrate.  Patient has asthma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 I would supplement the routine PA and lateral chest radiographs, which were
 performed using appropriate positioning and technique, with shallow oblique
 views to be sure that there is no left lower lung abnormality partially
 obscured by a small mediastinal fat collection at the apex of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Lungs are otherwise entirely clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
