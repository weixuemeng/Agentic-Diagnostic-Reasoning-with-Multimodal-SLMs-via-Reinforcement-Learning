                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  A calcified granuloma projects over the right
 lower lung, as before.  Patchy new opacity is present at the left lung base,
 but elsewhere, lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity, probably due to minor atelectasis. 
 If there is clinical concern for the possibility of early developing
 infection, then short-term followup radiographs could be considered, however.
