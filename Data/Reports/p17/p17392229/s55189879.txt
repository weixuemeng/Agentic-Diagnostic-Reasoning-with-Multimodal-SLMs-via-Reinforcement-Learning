                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on amiodarone therapy.  // amio-induced pulmonary
 toxicity      amio-induced pulmonary toxicity
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, and mild engorgement of central veins and pulmonary
 vessels not changed, and there is no pleural effusion.  New predominantly
 basilar areas of relatively central consolidation, right lung greater than
 left could be edema, but the sparing of the lung bases, and the absence of up
 other stigmata of heart failure suggest instead the possibility of drug
 toxicity, particularly if the patient is receiving parietal amiodarone, or
 pulmonary hemorrhage, or diffuse atypical pneumonia.
