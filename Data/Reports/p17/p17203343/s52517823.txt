                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Limbic encephalitis.  Patient with tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right subclavian line terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
 Orogastric and endotracheal tubes have been removed.  Retrocardiac opacity has
 improved with decreased elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which suggests
 improving atelectasis.   There are again multiple bilateral nodules suggesting
 metastatic disease.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in left lower lobe collapse.  Status post
 extubation.
