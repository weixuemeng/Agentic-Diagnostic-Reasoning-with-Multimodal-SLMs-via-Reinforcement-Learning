  1. Numerous bilateral nodular opacities measuring up to 3.4 cm in the right
  lower lobe compatible with pulmonary metastatic disease. 
  
  2. Probable collapse of the left lower lobe with associated volume loss and
  mediastinal shift.  
  
  3. OG tube terminates in the proximal stomach and could be advanced by 5 cm. 
  Remainder of support devices in standard position.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizures and new brain metastases found on outside hospital head CT.
 Intubated with OG tube placement.  Evaluate for placement.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  An upper enteric tube is in place, terminating in the proximal
 stomach.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  A right-sided
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the high right atrium. 
 Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. 
 The left hilar contour is not well evaluated.  There is nodular contour and
 infrahilar expansion of the right hilar contour as well as numerous bilateral
 scattered nodular opacities measuring up to 3.5 cm at the right lung base. 
 There is loss of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with leftward mediastinal
 shift suggestive of volume loss.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary metastatic disease with nodules measuring up to 3.4 cm at the
 right lung base.
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse with associated volume loss.
 3.  Orogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach and could be advanced
 by 5 cm.  Remainder of support devices in standard position.
