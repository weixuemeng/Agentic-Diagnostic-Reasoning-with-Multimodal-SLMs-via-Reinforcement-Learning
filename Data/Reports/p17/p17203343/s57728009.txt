                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:31 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with cough and an elevated white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Two views were taken of the chest.  Skinfold along the right chest wall on the
 second view should not be mistaken for pneumothorax.  Given the large number
 of lung nodules, it is difficult to detect any definite change except for
 greater confluence of opacity in the parahilar right lower lung.  This could
 be new pulmonary nodules alone or a small region of consolidation in the
 setting of enlarging and more numerous lung nodules.  Same can be said of the
 left lower lobe.  I doubt that conventional chest radiographs would be
 definitive.  Chest CT scanning would be needed to make this distinction. 
 Heart size is normal.  Right subclavian catheter ends in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
