                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // s/p ___ right
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___. Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been substantial interval decrease in the trace right pleural
 effusion following drainage. A right perihilar airspace opacity corresponding
 to radiation pneumonitis is unchanged when allowing for differences in
 technique. Prominent interstitial lung markings in the right lung the may be
 due to lymphatic congestion or lymphangitic spread of metastasis. The left
 lung is clear. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum
 are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval decrease in trace right pleural effusion following
 drainage.
 No pneumothorax.
 Right lung radiation pneumonitis.
 Asymmetric right lung interstitial prominence may be due to lymphatic
 congestion or lymphangitic spread of metastasis.
