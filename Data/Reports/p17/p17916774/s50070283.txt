 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that
 accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Little if any elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Left basilar opacification suggests volume loss in
 the lower lobe with pleural fluid, which could be related to splinting
 following rib fractures.
 No evidence of pneumothorax.  Left subclavian catheter again extends to the
 lower SVC.
