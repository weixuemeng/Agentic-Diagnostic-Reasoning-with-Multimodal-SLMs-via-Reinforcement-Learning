                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with epigastric free air; respiratory distress 
 // ?interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right PICC line has been repositioned with tip at upper SVC.  The
 peritoneal free air is not visualized but the supine position may decrease the
 ability to detect free air on chest radiograph.  The bilateral basilar
 atelectasis has improved.  No new consolidation.  No pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal.  No
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No free peritoneal air is visualized but the supine position may prevent 
 accurate detection of free air.
 
 2.  Stable chest radiograph.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinically necessary, CT chest can further evaluate for
 the presence of peritoneal free air.
