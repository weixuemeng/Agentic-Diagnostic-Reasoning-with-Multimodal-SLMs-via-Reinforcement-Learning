                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ___'s takedown, new cough, LLL ronchi on
 exam  // Pls evaluate for pna or atelectasis. Pls evaluate for other
 intrathoracic process. Please schedule between ___-0600h
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are lower,
 accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  Even
 allowing for this factor, there has been apparent development of pulmonary
 vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  New patchy opacities in the
 perihilar and basilar regions could reflect pulmonary edema, aspiration, or
 developing infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
