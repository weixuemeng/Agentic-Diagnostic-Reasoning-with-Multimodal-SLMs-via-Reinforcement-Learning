                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stage I lung cancer, COPD, increased shortness of breath for 1 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Chain sutures in the left suprahilar region are compatible with prior left
 upper lobe resection.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 emphysematous changes again demonstrated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are new.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis, but
 infection is not excluded. Perihilar haziness suggests mild pulmonary edema.  
 There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated. 
 Compression fracture of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  Emphysema. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis but infection
 cannot be excluded.
