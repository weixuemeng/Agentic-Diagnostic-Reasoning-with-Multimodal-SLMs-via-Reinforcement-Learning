 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to prior exam from the lung volumes are low, which exaggerates the
 heart size and interstitial opacities. Heart size is upper limits of normal. 
 Mild increased and bilateral interstitial basal opacities, especially on the
 left are likely due to atelectasis.
 Pleural margin on the right apex is thicker than left, which may be due to
 scarring. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no
 evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No pneumonia.
