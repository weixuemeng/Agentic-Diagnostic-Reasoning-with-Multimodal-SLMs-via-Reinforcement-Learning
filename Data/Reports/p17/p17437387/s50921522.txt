                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right sternoclavicular mass.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: No focal consolidations are seen.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusions.  The heart is normal in size.  No significant degenerative
 change is seen within the osseous structures.  There is suggestion of a 4.6 x
 2.4 cm soft tissue opacity overlying the mid-to-distal clavicle on the right
 side and the second and third right ribs - which may correlate with patient's
 palpable abnormality.  No remodeling of the underlying osseous structures is
 seen.
