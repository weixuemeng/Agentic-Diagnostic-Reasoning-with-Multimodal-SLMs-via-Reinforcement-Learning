                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia and hypertension and chest
 pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Lung volumes are low which causes
 bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusions or
 pneumothoraces. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No
 pulmonary edema is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis. A follow up
 exam with improved inspiratory effort can provide better assessment of the
 lung bases.
