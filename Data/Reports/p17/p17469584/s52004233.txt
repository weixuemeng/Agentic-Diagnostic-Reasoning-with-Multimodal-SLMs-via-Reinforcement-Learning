                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral posterior spinal hardware is seen, partially imaged.  The lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pulmonary
 edema is seen.  No displaced rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture seen.  However,
 if high clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series or CT is more
 sensitive.
