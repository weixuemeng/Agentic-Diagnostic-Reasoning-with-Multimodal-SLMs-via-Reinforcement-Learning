                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of motorcycle accident on
 ___ at ___, clavicle fracture and two right rib fractures, now with
 tenting clavicle.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Per radiology
 technologist,  the patient was unable to fully move her right arm out of the
 way for the lateral view because of broken clavicle.  The lateral view is
 suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm.  There is a displaced right mid
 clavicular fracture with inferior displacement of the distal portion and bony
 overriding of approximately 2.5 cm as well as a superior apex angulation.  The
 lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  There may be minimal blunting of
 the posterior costophrenic angle could be due to a trace pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 There may be a nondisplaced fracture of the anterior right upper rib. 
 Additional rib fractures are not well identified and could be further
 evaluated for on dedicated rib series.
