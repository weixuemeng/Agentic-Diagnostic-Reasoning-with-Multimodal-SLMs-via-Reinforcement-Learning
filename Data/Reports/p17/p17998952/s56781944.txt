                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ETT, OGT in place  // Please eval tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis ___ at 20:14
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is
 within the stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is
 calcified.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with perihilar
 haziness. Left basilar patchy opacity is noted, worrisome for aspiration.
 Similar but much smaller opacity is also noted within the right lung base.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Calcifications within the
 upper abdomen bilaterally correlate with staghorn calculi seen on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal tube and the orogastric tube.
 2.  Aspiration pneumonia within the lung bases.
 3. Partially imaged extensive staghorn renal calculi bilaterally.
