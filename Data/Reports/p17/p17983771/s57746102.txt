 WET READ: ___ ___ 5:51 PM
  Increased opacity in the right lung base likely represents atelectasis.  No
  definite focal consolidation identified to suggest pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT 17:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with renal transplant and UTI, breakthrough
 fevers on antibiotics, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lungs are well inflated without evidence of a focal airspace
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is a 9-mm rounded opacity at the
 left lung base, which most likely represents a nipple shadow, but given the
 asymmetry, followup imaging with a repeat chest film using nipple markers may
 be prudent.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Minimal blunting of both
 costophrenic angles may reflect tiny effusions versus pleural thickening. 
 Recommendations from this examination were submitted to the critical results
 dashboard, ___ at 9:14 a.m.
