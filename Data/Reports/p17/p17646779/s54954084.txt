                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Question rib fracture. Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extensive asbestos related pleural calcification obscures large areas of the
 lungs and the ribs. There is no pleural effusion. Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is slightly increased since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Conventional chest radiographs, are not sensitive for detection of chest cage
 trauma.  Detail views of clearly marked focal findings should be obtained
 instead. In this case detection of rib fractures is virtually impossible given
 the severe asbestos related pleural calcification which obscures the lungs and
 ribs.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.
