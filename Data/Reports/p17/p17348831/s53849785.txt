                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS; ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever, with presyncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest x-ray from ___ and two-view chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Somewhat linear left
 basilar opacities seen, most suggestive of atelectasis.  Lungs are otherwise
 clear without focal consolidation.  There is trace blunting of the posterior
 right costophrenic angle as on prior which could be due to trace effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. 
 Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
