                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension, chest pain along the right sternal border.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.

 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The lungs are clear and the pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic sulcus posteriorly appears chronic and may reflect pleural
 thickening rather than pleural fluid.  There is no acute osseous abnormality
 identified.  Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
