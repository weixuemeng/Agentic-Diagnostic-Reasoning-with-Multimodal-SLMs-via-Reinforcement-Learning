 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube terminates near the right lung apex.  There has
 been interval decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax which is now tiny.
 There is decreased opacity surrounding the right apical chain suture,
 consistent with resolving postoperative change.  No pleural effusion is
 detected on this view.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  The left lung appears well aerated without evidence for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased size of right apical pneumothorax.
