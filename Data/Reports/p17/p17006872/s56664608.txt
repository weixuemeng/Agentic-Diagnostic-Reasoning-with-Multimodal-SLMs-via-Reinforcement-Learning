 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post video-assisted bleb resection, evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a better expansion
 of the right lung.  However, at the very lung apex, a miniscule millimetric
 pneumothorax is still visible.  No evidence of tension, course of the right
 chest tube is constant.  Unchanged left hemithorax, unchanged appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette.
