                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Renal cell carcinoma, rule out intrathoracic disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable
 mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours.  Faint nodular opacities projecting
 over the anterolateral fourth and fifth ribs, are not seen on prior studies. 
 Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New faint nodular opacities projecting over anterior fourth and
 fifth ribs are likely artifact but could be further evaluated with oblique
 views.
