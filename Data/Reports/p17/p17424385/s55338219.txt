                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with stage II renal cell
 cancer, for intrathoracic disease.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are
 essentially clear.  Of note is nodular opacity projecting over the left lower
 lung, approximately 8.5 mm in diameter, not clearly seen on prior examination.
 Given patient's history, re-assessment with chest CT is required for precise
 characterization of this abnormality.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
