                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sweats, chills, elevated white count, postop day 5 Whipple and
 diarrhea, question acute intrathoracic process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is minimal calcification of the
 aorta.  No CHF or focal infiltrate is identified.  However, there is a
 right-sided effusion, that is new compared with the prior films, with minimal
 associated atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs are grossly clear.  No
 left-sided effusion.  Surgical clips, skin ___, and possible drain noted
 in the upper abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New small right pleural effusion.  I doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, an
 underlying pneumonic process.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.
