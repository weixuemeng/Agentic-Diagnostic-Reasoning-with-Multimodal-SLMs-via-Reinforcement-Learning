                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient noted to have questionable pneumonia
 at ___, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition does not permit examination in upright position
 and AP frontal view with patient sitting in wheelchair was used with
 additional left lateral view.  Comparison is made with two preceding chest
 examinations from ___ dated ___.  A
 wide-bore double-lumen catheter is present, apparently introduced via the
 right internal jugular approach and is seen to terminate in the lower SVC and
 right atrium apparently in unchanged location comparison with yesterday's
 examination (___).  There is moderate elevation of the
 left-sided diaphragm and the lateral pleural sinus is blunted, indicative of
 some pleural reaction.  When compared with the next preceding examination one
 day earlier, the diaphragmatic elevation is very similar in appearance.  The
 previously identified local parenchymal density interpreted as representing an
 acute infiltrate has regressed and with the exception of some linear densities
 suggestive of some atelectasis in the left lower lobe area, no evidence of
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities can be identified.  Observe that the
 diagnosis of an acute infiltrate was made on chest examination of ___ based on changes when comparing it with the previous chest examination of
 ___.  The new changes have regressed and indicate that they
 represented temporary fleeting process of the parenchyma superimposed on
 chronic elevation of the diaphragm, local pleural reaction and partial
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.  Chronic left lower lobe atelectasis,
 diaphragmatic elevation and mild blunting of the pleural spaces.  If findings
 require therapy, must be decided on clinical manifestations.
