                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with CHF, COPD, ESRD and respiratory distress, eval for
 volume overload versus pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 A right sided HD catheter terminates in the lower SVC.  The cardiac silhouette
 is moderately enlarged with mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right, are present with associated bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Indentation on the left trachea may reflect an enlarged goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with associated
 compressive atelectasis.
 
 3. Indentation on left trachea may reflect an enlarged goiter.  Follow-up with
 thyroid ultrasound if clinically relevant.
