                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  COPD.  Possible pneumonia exacerbation.  Is there volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Interstitial edema present on ___ has nearly resolved.  Small left
 pleural effusion is new, in association with new atelectasis in the left lung
 which may be responsible for obscuring what looked like a new small pneumonia
 at that time.  Clinical suspicion should be high for empyema or at least a
 sympathetic pleural exudate.  Heart is at least moderately enlarged, if
 larger, but unchanged in the interim.  Small right pleural effusion may be
 present, but if so attributable to recent and subsequently resolved edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Dual-channel right supraclavicular hemodialysis catheters end in the SVC and
 upper right atrium.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:45 a.m.
