                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:37 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Confirm NG tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. 
 As before, there is greater radiodensity in the right hemithorax than the
 left, but the disparity is less pronounced.  This could be due to posteriorly
 layering right pleural effusion or mild edema in the right lung.  At the left
 lung base is a region of consolidation or atelectasis, unchanged.  The heart
 is normal size.  Pleural effusion on the left is minimal if any.
