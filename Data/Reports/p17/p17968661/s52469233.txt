 infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ obtained at 11:51
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Very tortuous descending aorta is re- demonstrated.  The patient is rotated
 but overall the silhouette of the mediastinum is stable.  Interval improvement
 in the right basal opacity is demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is no appreciable pleural effusion.
 
 There is a possibility of right infrahilar lesion, that is currently partially
 obscured by patient rotation but can be suspected on several recent
 radiographs.  Does correlation with chest CT would be recommended for precise
 characterization of the right infrahilar findings.
