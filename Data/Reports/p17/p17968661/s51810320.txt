                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with afib on Coumadin, CKD, pernicious anemia
 p/w right thigh hematoma with reported RLL infiltrate on CXR from OSH  //
 Please evaluate for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside radiograph of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.  Subtle hazy opacity in
 right mid and lower lung has decreased in extent compared to prior radiograph.
 Apparent resolution of right pleural effusion.  Healed rib fractures are
 incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hazy opacity in right mid and lower hemi thorax could potentially be due in
 part to pleural thickening in this patient with evidence of previous chest
 wall trauma.  Coexisting right lower lobe consolidation is also possible in
 the setting of a history of recent right lower lobe pneumonia.  Further
 evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for
 more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
