                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with PMH of afib on Coumadin p/w right thigh
 hematoma now with fever and cough.  // Please assess for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___, the patient is markedly rotated accentuating a
 tortuous thoracic aorta and limiting assessment of the cardiomediastinal
 contours.  Worsening opacity at the right lung base is probably a combination
 of pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation or atelectasis.  Left lung and
 pleural surfaces are grossly clear on this limited study.
