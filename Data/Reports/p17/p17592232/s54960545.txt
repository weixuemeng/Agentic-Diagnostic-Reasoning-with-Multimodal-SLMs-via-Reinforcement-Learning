                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with an undefined chronic inflammatory demyelinating
 polyneuropathy previously on IVIG who presented to ICU with worsening
 respiratory distress and RLL pneumonia with w/u for weakness. Workup negative
 to date s/p trach and PEG  // interval change, placement of new tubes   
 interval change, placement of new tubes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube is been removed
 and a tracheostomy tube is now in place.  No evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  The enteric tube is been removed.
 Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with bibasilar opacifications, more
 prominent on the left.  Although these could reflect atelectasis and pleural
 fluid, it would be difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia (primarily on the left), especially in the absence of a lateral
 view.
