 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:14 PM
  Small right pleural effusion is increased in size.  Increased prominence of
  interstitial markings is concerning for mild pulmonary edema.  No
  pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema and
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  New, mild right lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is
 consistent with new, mild pulmonary edema.  Small, new right pleural effusion.
 Interval elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with increased retrocardiac
 opacity suggests left basilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Pulmonary
 nodules are not well appreciated radiographically.  Recommend repeat chest CT
 for follow-up of pulmonary nodules.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  New, mild pulmonary edema with a new, small right pleural effusion.
 2.  New right lower lobe atelectasis.
 3.  Pulmonary nodules are not well appreciated radiographically.  Recommend
 repeat chest CT for follow-up of pulmonary nodules.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest CT for pulmonary nodule follow-up.
