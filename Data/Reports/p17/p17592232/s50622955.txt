                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with an undefined chronic inflammatory demyelinating
 polyneuropathy previously on IVIG who presented to ICU with worsening
 respiratory distress and RLL pneumonia with w/u for weakness. Workup negative
 to date w/ change in vent setting overnight, leukocytosis.  Evaluate for new
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, no change in the positioning of the
 endotracheal tube and right IJ central line.  The NG tube terminates in the
 stomach.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis has improved.  There is a small
 persistent left basilar opacity.  The right lung is better aerated.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Significant improvement in the retrocardiac consolidation suggests a mucous
 plug was likely cleared.  Persistent left basilar opacity may be due to a
 small residual effusion and atelectasis.
