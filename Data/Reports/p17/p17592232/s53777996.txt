                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M dx w/ (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy)
 on  IVIG who presents to ICU with worsening respiratory distress and RLL
 pneumonia with worsening on CXR despite vanc/ cefepime now s/p repeat bronch. 
 Assess for interval change and or pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier on the same date and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. 
 Unchanged right IJ central line with tip projecting over the lower SVC, and NG
 tube in the stomach.
 
 Lungs remain hyperinflated.  The right lower lobe opacity is unchanged.  The
 left lower lobe opacity may be slightly improved, however this appearance may
 be a product of slight leftward rotation on this study.  Heart size is top
 normal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged right lower lobe opacity.  The left lower lobe opacity may be
 slightly improved, however the patient is slightly rotated to the left on the
 current study, which may confound findings.
 
 2.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
