                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with an undefined chronic inflammatory demyelinating
 polyneuropathy previously on IVIG who presented to ICU with worsening
 respiratory distress and RLL pneumonia with w/u for weakness s/p trach/PEG.
 Workup negative to date.  // interval change s/p pigtail removal    interval
 change s/p pigtail removal
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left pigtail catheter
 has been removed.  No definite pneumothorax, though the apical region is
 obscured by overlying material.  The increased opacification at the bases has
 substantially decreased.  Is unclear whether this represents true improvement
 in the pleural fluid and compressive basilar atelectasis, or merely a more
 erect position of the patient.
 There appears to be a new tracheostomy tube in place.
