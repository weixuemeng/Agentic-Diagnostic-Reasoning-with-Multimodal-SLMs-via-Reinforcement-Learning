                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ yo M with an undefined chronic inflammatory demyelinating
 polyneuropathy previously on IVIG who presented to ICU with worsening
 respiratory distress and RLL pneumonia with w/u for weakness s/p trach/PEG.
 Workup negative to date s/p pigtail placement for pneumothorax  // interval
 change, pigtail placement   interval change, pigtail placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at 01:04.
 
 Volume of previous substantial left pneumothorax has decreased following
 insertion of the left pigtail pleural drainage catheter.  There is probably a
 small residual paramediastinal and perhaps a tiny left apical component. 
 There is no appreciable left pleural effusion.  Moderate left lower lobe
 atelectasis is stable.
 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened substantially, perhaps lobar
 collapse.  Skin fold projecting over the right chest laterally should not be
 mistaken for a right pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Tracheostomy tube midline.
