  1. ETT approximately 3 cm from carina.
  2. Retrocardiac opacity with indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm could
  reflect atelectasis or aspiration/infection in the appropriate clinical
  situation.
  3.  Tilted and fractured median sternotomy wires raises concern of unstable
  sternum.  Correlate with clinical assessment.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with Massive gi bleed, intubated  // ett
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi supine portable AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT tip is approximately 3 cm from the carina.  The film has the appearance of
 a more apical lordotic technique.  The contours of the left hemidiaphragm are
 not clearly defined and there is a retrocardiac opacity.  These could reflect
 atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy and several of the sternotomy wires are fractured.  A
 partially visualized enteric tube traverses the hemidiaphragm into the left
 upper quadrant but its tip is beyond the scope of this imaging.  Several
 radio-opaque surgical material projects just to the left of the thoracic spine
 in the mediastinum.
