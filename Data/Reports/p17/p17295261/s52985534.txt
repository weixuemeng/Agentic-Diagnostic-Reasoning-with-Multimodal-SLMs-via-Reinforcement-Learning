                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  ___F s/p mechanical fall, on Plavix, headstrike, R anterior chest
 pain  // Eval for acute process, intrancranial bleed, rib fx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is a tiny hazy opacity projecting over the
 right middle lobe, unclear if it is in the soft tissue or lungs.  If is
 intrapulmonary, may represent a tiny contusion.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is top normal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  There is a chronic compression deformity of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body, not significantly changed compared with ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Tiny hazy opacity projecting over the right middle lobe is of uncertain
 etiology, and may be in the soft tissue or the lung.  If it is in the lung,
 may represent a tiny contusion.
 2. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional
 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.
