 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Exertional chest pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Slight prominence of the interstitial markings is likely due to low
 lung volumes; however, a component minimal interstitial edema is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Slight prominence of the markings likely due
 to low lung volumes; however, a component of minimal interstitial edema not
 excluded.  No focal consolidation.
