                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Palpitations.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 Pulmonary hyperinflation is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  Minor bihilar prominence is unchanged from before, likely
 reflecting vascular change.  No definitive acute cardiopulmonary finding is
 evident.  No good evidence of pneumonic consolidation.  Within the visualized
 osseous structures, there is some mid-thoracic level bi-concave changes
 consistent with some osteopenic wedging.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 No acute findings.
