                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of fever, elevated white
 blood cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle left
 base retrocardiac opacity, slightly increased as compared to the prior study,
 could relate to atelectasis, although an underlying small consolidation from
 infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle left base retrocardiac opacity, slightly increased as
 compared to the prior study, could be due to atelectasis, although in the
 appropriate clinical setting, a small consolidation from infection is not
 excluded.
