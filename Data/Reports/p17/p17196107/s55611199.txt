                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with altered mental status, hypoglycemia  // eval
 for infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low compared to the previous study.  This accentuates the
 size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is demonstrated
 without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities within the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggests a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.  There
 are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases, possibly
 atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion.
