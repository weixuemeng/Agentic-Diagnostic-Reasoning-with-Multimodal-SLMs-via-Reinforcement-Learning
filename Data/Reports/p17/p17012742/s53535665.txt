                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and dyspnea.  Question
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Heart is normal size.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion is no longer
 present and there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion, although
 substantial left atrial enlargement is visible on the lateral projection.   A
 6-mm round opacity projecting over the left third anterior rib could be a
 small lung nodule or bone island in that rib. Shallow oblique views should be
 obtained in hopes of differentiating between those possibilities.  Ultimately,
 CT scanning may be necessary.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
 
 Dr. ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of
 dictation.
