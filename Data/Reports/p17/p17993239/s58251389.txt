 mid and lower right lung.  Lungs are otherwise fully expanded.  Heart size is
 top-normal.  No pulmonary vascular congestion.  A Dobhoff tube terminates in

 Rapid improvement of patchy left lung opacities and rapid development of
 patchy right lung opacities is most consistent with recurrent aspiration.
