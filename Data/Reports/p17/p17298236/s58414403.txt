                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right rib pain, assess for fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lungs are clear overall, though slight obscuration of the left
 costophrenic sulcus is seen which may be due to atelectasis, though pneumonia
 cannot be fully excluded.  There is no right-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is top normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette. No displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No displaced rib fractures, but right ribs are incompletely
 imaged on this radiograph. Left basal opacity likely atelectasis, though in
 the setting of infectious symptoms pneumonia should be considered. 
 
 This was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by phone.
