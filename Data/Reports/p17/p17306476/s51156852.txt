                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question aspiration.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A trace pleural effusion is
 suggested by blunting of each posterior costophrenic sulcus, but not
 substantial.  Background lung markings are mildly coarsened with no evidence
 for superimposed acute abnormality.  Degenerative changes are noted along each
 acromioclavicular joint.  The acromiohumeral interval is narrowed on the left.
 Small osteophytes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.  The bones are
 probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
