                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intracranial hemorrhage, now intubated. 
 Question tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending 3.7
 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube traverses inferiorly into the stomach
 with side port within the gastric cavity.  The heart is normal in size,
 allowing for AP projection.  Thoracic aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  The right heart border is obscured by dense opacities
 throughout the right lung which likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 Small effusions cannot be excluded.  There is remote lateral fracture in the
 right 9th rib.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriate ET tube and enteric tube positioning.
 2.  Bilateral pulmonary opacity, right>left, likely asymmetric pulmonary
 edema.
