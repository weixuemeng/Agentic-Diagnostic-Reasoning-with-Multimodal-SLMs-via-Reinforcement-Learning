                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with left lung nodule after
 bronchoscopy.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to preoperative study
 obtained the same day earlier and PET-CT from ___.
 
 The post-sternotomy wires in a patient after aortic valve replacement are
 stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The post-radiation changes in
 the right mid and lower lung, most likely related to prior breast cancer, are
 noted.  The nodule in the left lower lobe is in part obscured by the overlying
 leads.  No evidence of pleural effusion or atelectasis is demonstrated as
 well.
