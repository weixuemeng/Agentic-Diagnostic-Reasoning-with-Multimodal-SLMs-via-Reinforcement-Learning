                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval development of increased opacity in the left retrocardiac
 region, which could be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or a developing site of
 pneumonia.  Otherwise, no relevant short interval change since the recent
 study with extensive calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and chronic
 left-sided pleural thickening.
