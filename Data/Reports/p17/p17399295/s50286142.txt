                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hodgkin's lymphoma, atypical chest pain, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases.  In addition, a right pleural
 effusion is bigger than on the previous image, and has a relatively
 substantial apical lateral component.  Calcifications are still seen
 projecting over the anterior mediastinum on the lateral film and over the
 aortopulmonary window on the frontal film.  A pacemaker device has been
 inserted in the anterior chest wall.  Given the underlying disorder, CT is
 recommended to clarify cause for the increasing pleural effusion and pleural
 thickening on the left.
 
 The finding was posted on the radiology dashboard at the time of discovery and
 dictation of the report, 11:39 a.m., on ___.
