                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, questionable flash pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases.  The pleural effusions that
 pre-existed have not substantially increased as compared to the previous
 examination.  However, the lateral film shows more fluid in interstitial
 spaces, suggesting an increase in severity of pre-existing fluid overload. 
 Unchanged appearance of the pre-described calcifications.  Unchanged size of
 the cardiac silhouette.
