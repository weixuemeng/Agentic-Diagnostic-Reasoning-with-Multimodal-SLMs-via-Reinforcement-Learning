 As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pleural effusions is
 not substantially changed.  The effusions are more extensive on the right than
 on the left and limited to the lung bases and to the area of the costophrenic
 sinuses. The effusions have not increased in the interval. The pacemaker,
 massive lymph node calcifications in the mediastinum as well as the areas of
 scarring in the lung parenchyma and the vascular stents are not substantially
 changed.
