 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 17:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with advanced NG tube, check position.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 13:19.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 17:11 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval advancement of the nasogastric tube, which now has its
 tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach.  Right internal
 jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged.  Bibasilar
 airspace disease and layering pleural effusions are again seen suggestive of
 compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence
 of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
