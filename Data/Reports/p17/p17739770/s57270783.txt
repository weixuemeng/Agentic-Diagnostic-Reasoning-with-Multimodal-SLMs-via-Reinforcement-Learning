                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:58 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with coronary artery disease and a bicycle
 accident with multiple trauma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate ET tube
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:02 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, approximately 5.5 cm
 from the carina, standard placement.  Nasogastric tube is coiled in the
 stomach.  Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.  The only focal pulmonary
 abnormality is consolidation obscuring the descending thoracic aorta and
 portion of the left hemidiaphragm.  This could be atelectasis or developing
 pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Evaluation of subtle chest cage, such as the thoracic vertebral
 burst fracture diagnosed by torso CT, is not reliably assessed by conventional
 chest radiography.
