                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of polytrauma, to look for lung changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above carina at the level of the clavicles. 
 Consider advancing the ET tube by 1-2 cm for better seating.  Tip of right
 subclavian line ends at mid SVC.  Opacification of the left lung base,
 unchanged since yesterday, can simply be explained by a combination of
 mild-to-moderate effusion and accompanying left lower lung atelectasis.  Left
 upper lung and right lung are clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild but increased opacification at the left lung base, unchanged over last 24
 hours, is likely atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Pleural effusion if any is
 small on the left side.  No pneumothorax.
