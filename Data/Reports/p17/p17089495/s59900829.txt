                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Difficulty breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There are patchy airspace opacities in the mid to lower lungs
 as well as the right upper lung.  The left upper lung is spared.  Pulmonary
 vascularity appears within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous airspace opacification.  Although pulmonary edema could be
 considered, imaging findings are more suggestive perhaps of multifocal
 pneumonia or perhaps aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
