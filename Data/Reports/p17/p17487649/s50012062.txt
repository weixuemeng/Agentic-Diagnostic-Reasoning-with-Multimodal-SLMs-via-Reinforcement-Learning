                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ w/ chronic pancreatitis and panc stone now s/p open distal
 pancreatectomy/splenectomy.  // Fever/declining O2 sats. PNA vs. atelectasis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip terminates in knee
 right atrium, this could be withdrawn 3 cm to be positioned in the SVC.  A
 linear metallic density projects over the left hemi thorax, unchanged compared
 to the prior study.  A presumed to be external to the patient.  There is in
 the left basilar airspace opacity with partial silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  This may reflect atelectasis or consolidation.  No other areas
 of concern for consolidation are seen.  No definite pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.  The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left basilar airspace opacity may reflect atelectasis versus infection.
 
 A right internal jugular catheter is positioned within the right atrium, this
 could be withdrawn 3 cm.
