  Right-sided PICC line is deep into the right atrium, with a curvature at the
  tip suggestive of contact with the right atrial wall, which may precipitate
  atrial arrhythmias, concerning in this patient with a recent episode of atrial
  fibrillation. The line should be pulled back at least 5 cm for placement at
  the cavoatrial junction or the lower SVC. Cardiomegaly. No pulmonary
  opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cardiogenic shock (resolving), AFib
 (cardioverted), pls evaluate for interval change in effusions  // please
 evaluate for interval change in pleural effusion     please evaluate for
 interval change in pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the right subclavian PICC
 line extends well into the right atrium. It would have to be retracted about
 4-5 cm if the desired position is at or above the cavoatrial junction.
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left basilar
 opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small
 effusion. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with continued
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
