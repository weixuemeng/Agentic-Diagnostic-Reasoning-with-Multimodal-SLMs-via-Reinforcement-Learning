                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 11:39 from outside institution
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided pacemaker device with leads terminate a right atrium right
 ventricle is unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  Aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is not substantially changed in
 the interval.  A moderate size left pleural effusion is relatively similar
 compared to the previous study.  Worsening opacification the left lung base
 may reflect worsening pneumonia.  The right lung is otherwise grossly clear. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  There are mild multilevel degenerative changes
 seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity appears slightly increased in the interval which may
 suggest worsening pneumonia.  Moderate left pleural effusion is relatively
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also similar.
