                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right pectoral pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle,
 as expected.
 
 There has been no significant interval change compared to the prior chest
 radiograph on ___.  Right lung is essentially clear.  Dense left
 retrocardiac opacity is similar, and may represent atelectasis or infection in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  A small pleural effusion is present on the
 left.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
 Dual lead right-sided pacer remains in place.  Surgical clips in the lateral
 left breast consistent with prior lumpectomy for cancer.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No interval change in left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis
 or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Small left pleural effusion.
