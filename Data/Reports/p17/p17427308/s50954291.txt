                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman AFib w/ RVR, shock  // Please assess for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, moderate left pleural
 effusion and adjacent left retrocardiac opacification have slightly worsened. 
 Curvilinear interfaces in the periphery of the left hemi thorax probably
 reflect skin folds and less likely a component of hydro pneumothorax.
