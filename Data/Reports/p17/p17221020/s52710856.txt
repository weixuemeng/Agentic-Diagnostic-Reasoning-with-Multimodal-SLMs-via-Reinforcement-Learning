                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and PET-CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Multifocal bilateral pulmonary
 nodules and masses are seen, significantly enlarged since ___.  Given
 differences in technique there is no clear difference since exam from earlier
 the same month.  Given the extent of disease, it would be difficult to exclude
 a superimposed infection.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 unchanged overall less well evaluated on the current exam due to silhouetting
 of the left.  No acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Multifocal metastatic disease in the lungs which limits evaluation for
 superimposed infectious process in the lungs.
