                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post pericardial window for malignant pericardial effusion
 causing tamponade.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and PET-CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is extensive intraparenchymal
 metastatic disease.  A 1.5 cm opacity in the right lower lung is more
 conspicuous on this study.  This lesion and the left upper lobe mass contain a
 central areas of lucency reflecting cavitation.  Apparent increase in lesion
 size is likely related to differences in projection.  Interlobular septal
 thickening in the right lower lung is worse from prior and could reflect
 developing lymphangitic carcinomatosis or local edema.  Overall, there is
 apparent progression of disease.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 The heart is normal size after pericardial window creation, unchanged from
 prior but smaller from ___.  Mediastinal structures are stable. 
 Clips are seen within the breasts.
