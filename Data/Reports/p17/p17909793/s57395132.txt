                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with malaise and increasing MS symptoms.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lateral view is suboptimal due to the patient's inability to raise his
 arms.  Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which appears mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt
 pulmonary edema.  There is patchy atelectasis within the lung bases without
 focal consolidation.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present,
 however the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of
 view.  No definite acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
