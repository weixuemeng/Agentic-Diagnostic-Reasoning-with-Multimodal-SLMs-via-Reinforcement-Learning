                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Blood loss, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip somewhat obscured by the
 spinal fixation device.  Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the
 side port is above the GE junction.  Left chest tube remains in place without
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
