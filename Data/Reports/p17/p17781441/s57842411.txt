 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturations, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube is in
 unchanged position.  There is no visible pneumothorax on the left.  Minimal
 atelectasis is present at the left and right lung base, but the right lung has
 improved radial lucency, reflecting improved ventilation.  Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No overt pulmonary edema.
