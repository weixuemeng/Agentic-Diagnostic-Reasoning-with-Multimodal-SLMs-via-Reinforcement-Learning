                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, dyspnea, productive cough, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph provided.  The lung volumes
 are low, which limits the evaluation.  There is subtle opacity at the left
 lung base, which could represent crowding of bronchovasculature/atelectasis,
 though an early pneumonia is not excluded.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
 No effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable,
 though rotation limits evaluation.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam with subtle opacity at the left lung base, which
 could represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  If needed, a
 dedicated PA and lateral view may be obtained to confirm with more optimized
 technique.
