                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with s/p fall, RUE injuries, b/l knee abrasions and R tib
 plateau swelling.  // eval ? traumatic injury
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings seen the lung bases, left greater than right. 
 Superiorly, the lungs demonstrate coarse interstitial markings but without
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Coarsened interstitial marking suggesting chronic underlying interstitial
 process.  More confluent opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right.
 While these could be chronic in nature, superimposed infection would be
 possible
