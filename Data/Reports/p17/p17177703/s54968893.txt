                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The patient appears to be
 status post right lower lobectomy with multiple chain sutures and clips noted
 in the right hilum.  Rightward mediastinal shift is compatible with volume
 loss in the right lung.  Linear opacities within the right mid lung field
 likely reflects scarring.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. Lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms.
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Diffuse demineralization of the
 osseous structures is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postsurgical changes in the right lung without evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality. Probable COPD.
