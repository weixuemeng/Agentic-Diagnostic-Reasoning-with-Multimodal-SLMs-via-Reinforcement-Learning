                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cirrhosis and COPD with increased work of breathing.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 postoperative appearance involving the right hemithorax.  No acute focal
 consolidation.  There is some increased prominence of the pulmonary vessels in
 the left mid and lower zones, which most likely reflects either the patient in
 an AP supine versus PA projection, or possibly some asymmetric elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
