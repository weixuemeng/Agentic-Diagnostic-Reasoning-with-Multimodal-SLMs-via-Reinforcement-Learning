                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The left port is unchanged in
 position with tip projecting over the mid SVC.  Previously noted pulmonary
 nodules on chest CT are not visualized on this study which is expected given
 their small size.  If further surveillance is required, a chest CT is
 recommended over radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
