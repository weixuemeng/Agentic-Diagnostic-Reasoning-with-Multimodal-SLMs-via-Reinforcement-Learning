                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is subtle
 opacity in the right infrahilar region which could represent crowding of
 bronchovasculature.  The possibility for hilar pathology is not excluded,
 however.  No effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Left hilar shadow appears normal.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence in the right infrahilar region likely reflects
 overlapping bronchovascular markings, though CT may be performed to further
 assess if there is continued clinical concern.
