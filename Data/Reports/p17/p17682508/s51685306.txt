 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Streaky left lower lobe opacity likely
 reflects atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. 
 Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant compatible with prior
 cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky left lower lobe opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
