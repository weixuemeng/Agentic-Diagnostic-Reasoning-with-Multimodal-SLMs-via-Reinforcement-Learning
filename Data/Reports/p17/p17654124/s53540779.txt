                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with chronic subdural hematoma. 
 Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There is superior traction of the left
 hilum.  Subtle opacity projects over the left scapula in the region of the
 overlying cardiac lead.  Findings are suggestive of underlying scarring. 
 Elsewhere the lungs are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size.  For
 technique.  No acute osseous abnormality seen, hypertrophic changes seen
 spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Findings suggestive of scarring in
 the left upper lung.   Correlation with older films to document stability
 would be of use.
