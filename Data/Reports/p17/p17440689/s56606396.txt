                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with spontaneous___ transferred from ___ with left chest

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same day
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left chest tube is noted projecting over the left upper lung.  No sizeable
 residual pneumothorax.  Triangular opacity in the left midlung could represent
 a combination of pleural scarring and atelectasis.  The left lung base is
 opacified, likely the combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.  There is
 mild vascular congestion.  Opacification of the retrocardiac region may
 represent a hiatal hernia.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Left chest tube projecting over the left upper lung.
 2. No appreciable residual left pneumothorax.
 3. Scarring and pleural thickening at the left lung base.
