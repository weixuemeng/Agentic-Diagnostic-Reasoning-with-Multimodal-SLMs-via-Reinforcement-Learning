                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New right IPH, question chest infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is
 mildly tortuous and unfolded, probably with faint calcification.  An unusual,
 thin linear density projects to the left of the superior mediastinum, but
 vessels project beyond it, making pneumothorax unlikely.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate or effusion is identified.  Mild scoliosis and probable slight
 scalloping/compression of the superior endplate of the T5 vertebral body
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Linear density to the left of the superior mediastinum is noted, but may
 represent a small amount of scarring or the edge of a bleb or bullae, as
 vessels pass beyond it, making a pneumothorax unlikely.
 2.  Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
