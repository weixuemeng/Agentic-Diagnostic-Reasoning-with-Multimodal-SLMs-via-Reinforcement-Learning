 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are probably hyperinflated.
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The tip of the RV lead extends very minimally beyond the edge of
 the film.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a tapered appearance is suggestive
 of pulmonary hypertension.

 CHF.  Equivocal minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal infiltrate identified to confirm pneumonia.
 
 Probable degenerative changes in both glenohumeral joints, not fully evaluated
 on this examination.

 Bibasilar atelectasis similar to 1 day earlier.  No focal infiltrate detected
 to confirm pneumonia.  Suspect background COPD/ pulmonary hypertension.
