                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alcohol dependence / withdrawal,
 tachycardia, fever  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  Superimposed
 infection cannot be definitely excluded.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax seen.  The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.  No
 free air under the diaphragm.  Old fracture of the distal left clavicle,
 deformity of the glenoid and left proximal humerus also likely reflects a
 chronic fracture.  Deformity of the distal right clavicle consistent with an
 old fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Multiple
 fractures of the bilateral shoulders are likely chronic but incompletely
 evaluated on this study.
