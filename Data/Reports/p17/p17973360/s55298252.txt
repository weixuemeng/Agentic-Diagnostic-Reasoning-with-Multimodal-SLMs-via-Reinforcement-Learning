                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bibasilar crackles and dCHF  // infiltrate
 vs edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Images of the lung bases from CT abdomen ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal allowing for accentuation by low lung
 volumes and portable technique. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied
 by minimal interstitial edema.  Patchy bibasilar opacities likely represent
 atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration given the presence
 of a hiatal hernia.
