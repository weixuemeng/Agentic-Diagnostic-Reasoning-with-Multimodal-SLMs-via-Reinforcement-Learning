                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers and constitutional symptoms.  Per Dr. ___ patient with
 history of congenital heart disease.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate normal heart size. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact sternotomy wires. 
 There is increased pulmonary vascularity with dilated pulmonary arteries and
 cephalization consistent with a history of congenital heart disease.  No overt
 pulmonary edema. There is background intertitial abnormality with cuffing of
 the airways as can be seen with small airways disease, but there are more
 confluent retrocardiac and right infrahilar opacities which would reflect an
 early pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Background interstial abnormality with cuffing of the airways as can be
 seen with small airways disease with more confluent opacity in the bilateral
 lower lobes, which could represent early pneumonia.  Correlation with prior
 films may be helpful. 
 
 2. Increased pulmonary vascularity consistent with patients history of
 congential heart disease without overt edema.  
 
 Telephone notification to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:00 on ___ and
 emailed to the ED QA nurse as the patient had already left the ED.
