                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions,
 intubated.  // Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter is present with tip
 terminating in the right atrium.  An ETT is present with tip terminating in
 standard position approximately 4.7 cm above the carina at the level of the
 mid clavicular heads.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely
 enlarged.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum is due to known pericardial
 effusion as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Bilateral effusions are
 moderate.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is complete left lower lobe
 collapse with right lower lobe atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary edema is present. 
 The upper abdomen is unremarkable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   No significant interval change since the recent chest CT with moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions with mild edema, left lower lobe collapse, and
 right lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion.  The ventricular pseudoaneurysm was
 documented on the recent chest CT.
 3.  Mediastinal adenopathy.
