                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP supine view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Endotracheal tube is low
 lying, terminating at the carina.  Cardiac silhouette size is moderately
 enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.  Mild pulmonary
 edema is present with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities
 likely reflect areas of collapse though infection is not completely excluded. 
 No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.  A catheter seen in
 with tip projecting over the right aspect of the L2 vertebral body.  There is
 moderate gaseous distension of bowel loops within the upper abdomen. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina.  Recommend
 withdrawal by at least 3 cm.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting collapse though infection is
 not completely excluded.
