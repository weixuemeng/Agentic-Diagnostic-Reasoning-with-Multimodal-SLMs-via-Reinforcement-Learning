                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough.  Long history of smoking  //
 ?concerns
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower than before which may account for region of greater
 opacification at the right lung base medially. Lateral view was performed at
 even a lower level of inspiration.
 
 If symptoms persist, I would recommend repeat chest radiographs at full
 inspiration incorporating oblique views to improve the evaluation of the lower
 lobes. Upper lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 normal and there is no pleural abnormality.
