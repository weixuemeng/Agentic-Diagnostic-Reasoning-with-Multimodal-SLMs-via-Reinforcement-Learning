                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion, for evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion accompanying lower lung
 atelectasis has increased since ___.  Mediastinal shift to the left
 side is secondary to the moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  Left lung
 is clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Because of the large right pleural effusion obscuring the right mediastinal
 border, assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited. 
 Hypodensity in the right upper quadrant and epigastric region is possibly from
 carcinoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion accompanying right lower
 lung atelectasis and causing mediastinal shift to the left side, is worsened
 since ___.
