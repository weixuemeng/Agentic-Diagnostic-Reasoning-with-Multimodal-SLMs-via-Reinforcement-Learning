                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 11:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recurrent right pleural effusion and CT
 placement.  Evaluate chest tube placement and pleural effusion.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 15:12.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Two right-sided chest tubes remain unchanged in position, both of which
 terminate at the apex.  The previously described pigtail catheter at the right
 lung base has been removed.  There is some increase in consolidation at the
 right base with overall decrease in volume of the right lung since the
 previous study.  These findings would favor atelectasis in the setting of an
 increasing effusion.  The left lung is grossly clear.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable, although difficult to assess due to
 the right-sided airspace consolidation.  Multiple radiopaque densities in the
 right upper quadrant and midline are likely related to the patient's treatment
 for hepatocellular carcinoma.  The chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is
 diminishing.  A tiny right apical pneumothorax is likely present, although the
 loculated basilar pneumothorax is no longer appreciated.  No pulmonary edema.
