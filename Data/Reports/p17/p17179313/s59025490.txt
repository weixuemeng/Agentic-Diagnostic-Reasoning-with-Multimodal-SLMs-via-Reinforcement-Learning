                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To look for residual pneumothorax and chest tube placement.  The
 patient after pleuroscopy and pleurodesis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Following drainage, moderate right pleural effusion has substantially resolved
 with mild-to-moderate persisting atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
 A tiny right apical pneumothorax and small loculated pneumothorax in the right
 lower lateral lung is present.  There are two chest tubes, one reaching all
 the way till the right apex and another placed at the right lung base.  Left
 lung is clear.  Increased coarse hyperdensity in the right hypochondriac and
 epigastric region is from a prior chemoembolization for a known HCC. 
 Subcutaneous air around the right hemithorax and neck is consistent with
 recent pleuroscopy and pleurodesis.
 
 IMPRESSION: Following drainage, right moderate pleural effusion has
 substantially resolved with minimal residual fluid and mild-to-moderate right
 lower lung atelectasis.  A tiny right apical and a very small loculated
 pneumothorax in the lower lateral lung seen.
