                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male intubated for septic shock and hypoxia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Endotracheal tube terminates
 4.2 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube terminates within the stomach.  Heart
 size is normal.  Consolidative opacity of the right lower lobe is consistent
 with pneumonia or aspiration.  Hilar pulmonary arteries are enlarged.  No
 pneumothorax, substantial pleural effusion. Gas collection in the right upper
 abdomen is most likely hepatic flexure, abscess should be considered from a
 clinical standpoint.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube and enteric tube appear in appropriate position.  
 
 2.  Right lower lobe consolidation, compatible with pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 3.  Clinical evaluation suggested to exclude right upper abdomen abscess.
 
 4.  Probable pulmonary hypertension. 
 
 I discussed the findings by telephone with Dr ___ at 9AM on ___.
