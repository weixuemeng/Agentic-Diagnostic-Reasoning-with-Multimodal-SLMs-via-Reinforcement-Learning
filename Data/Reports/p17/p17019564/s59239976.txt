                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with anorexia and dobhoff from outside
 hospital.  // confirm dobhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A Dobhoff type tube with radiopaque tip is present.  The tube is coiled on
 itself.  I suspect it is coiled in the stomach with the tip closer to the
 proximal stomach.  The possibility that the tip extends through duodenum to
 lie near the ligament of Treitz is possible, but considered less likely.
 
 Visualized portion of the lungs grossly clear.  No left pleural effusion.  In
 the partially visualized abdomen, no air-filled dilated loops of small bowel
 are identified.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  Stool is noted in
 nondilated loops of colon.
