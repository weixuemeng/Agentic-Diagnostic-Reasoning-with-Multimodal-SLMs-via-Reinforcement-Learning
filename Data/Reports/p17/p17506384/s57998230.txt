                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever, altered mental status.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for
 comparison.
 
 The heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable except for calcified
 aorta.  Upper lungs are clear.  Bibasal opacities are noted, projecting over
 the spine on the lateral view and might potentially reflect pneumonia in
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is evidence of multiple compression
 fractures of the lower thoracic, upper lumbar spine.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.
