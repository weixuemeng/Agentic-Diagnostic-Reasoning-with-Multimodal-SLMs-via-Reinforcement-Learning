                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with stroke.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral view is suboptimal.  A large density projects over the
 lower mediastinum with splaying of the carina.  The visualized aerated
 portions of lungs demonstrate no consolidation, pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the
 setting of this overlying density.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large density in the mid lower chest, which is nonspecific.  This
 may represent a dilated left atrium or hiatal hernia or mediastinal mass.  CT
 is recommended for further evaluation.
 
 Preliminary findings and recommendations discussed with ___ by
 ___ by phone at 5:51 p.m. on ___ at time of discovery of
 these findings.
