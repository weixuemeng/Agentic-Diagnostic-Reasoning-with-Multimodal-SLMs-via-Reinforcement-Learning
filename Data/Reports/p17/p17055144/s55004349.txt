                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 2:12 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with new nasogastric tube, assess placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at  17:05.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film on ___ at 2:12 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which passes to the right of
 midline and has its tip above the diaphragm.  Given its course, however, this
 may be positioned within an intrathoracic stomach or a large hiatal hernia. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  The lungs are low in volumes, but without
 evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given
 patient rotation.  No pneumothorax.
