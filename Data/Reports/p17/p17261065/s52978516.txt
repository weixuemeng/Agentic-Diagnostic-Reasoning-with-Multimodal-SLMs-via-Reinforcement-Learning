                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hf and ___.  // ___ placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 811
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen.  The tip lies more distal,
 compared with the film from 1 day earlier, now lying relatively distal over
 the right pulmonary artery, possibly at the origin of an inferior lobe vessel.
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker/ tib-fib related type device, with 3
 leads, unchanged.
 
 There is very slight upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
 Again seen is cardiomegaly probably slightly improved.  No focal infiltrate or
 effusion.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval advancement of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter.  Clinical
 correlation regarding possible retraction requested.
 2. Probable interval decrease in size of cardiac silhouette, this appearance
 is also likely accentuated by differences in film technique.  Minimal upper
 zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
