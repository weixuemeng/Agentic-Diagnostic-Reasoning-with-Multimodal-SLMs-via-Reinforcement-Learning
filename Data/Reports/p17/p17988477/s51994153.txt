                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rheumatoid arthritis, on methotrexate with increasing dyspnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the right base with the patient taking a larger inspiration. 
 This most likely represents a combination of radiation effect and scarring,
 though superimposed recurrent tumor or even infection cannot be definitely
 excluded.  CT would be necessary to make this distinction.
 
 The left lung and upper portion of the right lung remains clear.
 
 There is a substantial hilar adenopathy bilaterally, though this appears to be
 reduced since the previous study and is primarily seen on the lateral
 projection.
