                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o lung CA s/p cyberknife with scar vs.
 recurrence, now with fever/cough  // ?new infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PET-CT from ___ and chest radiographs from ___
 and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest show dense horizontal linear scar in the
 right middle lobe and somewhat stellate increased opacity just below this in
 the region of the patient's CyberKnife markers. This is not significantly
 different compared to recent plain films and no other areas of consolidation
 are seen suggestive of pneumonia. Cardiac contours and bony structures
 including intact lower cervical fixation plate are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stellate opacity inferior to right middle lobe scarring region of CyberKnife
 previously evaluated with PET scanning (suggesting either recurrence or
 residual inflammation in treated area.) No other opacities suggestive of
 pneumonia.
