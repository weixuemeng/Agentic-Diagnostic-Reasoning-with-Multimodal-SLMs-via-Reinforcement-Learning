                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  Right mid lung mass with
 fiducial markers appears similar in appearance compared to prior.  There is
 associated right-sided volume loss with shifting of the airway and elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no effusion.  No acute
 osseous abnormality is identified.  Lower cervical upper thoracic anterior
 vertebral body fixation is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid lung opacity with post-treatment changes is identified.
 Evaluation for subtle change/tumor is not possible and CT would be necessary. 
 There is no definite acute superimposed process.
