                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are relatively low lung volumes.  There is opacity involving
 the right mid-to-lower lung and blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 concerning for right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, areas of
 right-sided consolidation may be present.  There is also slight blunting at
 the posterior left costophrenic angle and there may be a trace left pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.  There is prominence of the perihilar vasculature and there is some
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion/possible pleural thickening with right
 lung atelectasis, possible right mid-to-lower lung consolidation.  Pulmonary
 edema and enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Slight blunting of the posterior left
 costophrenic angle may be due to a trace left pleural effusion.  Recommend
 followup to resolution to exclude an underlying neoplastic process.
