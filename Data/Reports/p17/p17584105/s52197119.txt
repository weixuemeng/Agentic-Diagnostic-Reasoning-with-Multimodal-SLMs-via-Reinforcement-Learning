                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions
 with overlying atelectasis.  Bibasilar opacities likely relate to the above,
 although developing consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation cannot be completely excluded.
