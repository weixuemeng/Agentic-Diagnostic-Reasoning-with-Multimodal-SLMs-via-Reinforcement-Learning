                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD placement, ___ ligation.  // FAST Track
 extubation cardiac surgery, ?line placement, ?PTX/Effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Intraoperative fluoroscopic images from ___, and chest
 radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the intraoperative fluoroscopic image obtained on ___, the
 Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly retracted and now terminates in the
 proximal right pulmonary artery.  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above
 the carina.  Enteric tube extends to the body of the stomach.  There are 2
 chest tubes on the left.  Status post LVAD and left atrial appendage ligation.
 
 Since ___, lung volumes are much lower.  Dense left retrocardiac
 opacity likely represents atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild.
 No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged,
 with minimal pneumopericardium.  Widened mediastinum is consistent with
 postoperative change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of multiple support lines/devices, including
 repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
 2. Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Postoperative mediastinal contours.
