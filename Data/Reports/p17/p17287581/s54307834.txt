                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain after recent
 surgery.  Assess for subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CT abdomen
 and pelvis from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear opacities within the lung bases, left
 greater than right, correspond with atelectasis seen on concurrent CT.  No
 confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary
 edema or pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
