                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are
 clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is minimal prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery, which may be positional, although mild enlargement of
 the pulmonary arteries is not excluded and could be further evaluated on CT.
