                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pancreatic
 adenocarcinoma with fever and chills.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal in appearance.  The upper lungs
 are essentially clear.  Bilateral basal opacities are noted with potential air
 bronchogram on the right more pronounced than on the left that are concerning
 for atelectasis versus infectious process.  Small amount of left pleural
 effusion is present as well as minimal amount of right pleural effusion. 
 Although those findings might be secondary to intra-abdominal pathology,
 bibasal infectious process is a possibility.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of low SVC.
