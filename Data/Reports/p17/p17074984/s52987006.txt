                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new intubation.  // Evaluate ETT.     
 Evaluate ETT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 endotracheal tube that extends to about 5 cm above the carina.  There are
 lower lung volumes with continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic
 contour.
 Areas of increased opacification are again seen at the right base medially. 
 This could represent crowding of vessels or atelectasis, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
