                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p AVR, cTS d/c'd  // evaluate for
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs the most recent on ___ at 13:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and enteric tube.  A
 right internal jugular sheath terminates in the upper SVC.
 
 The heart is markedly enlarged, but largely stable from the prior examination.
 There is a small to moderate right effusion and increased opacity throughout
 the right lung which may reflect atelectasis or mild edema.  There is marked
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left basal pulmonary opacity, likely
 compressive atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion and increased opacity throughout the right lung
 may reflect mild pulmonary edema.  Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm
 and opacity at the base of the left basal atelectasis is re- demonstrated.  No
 pneumothorax.
