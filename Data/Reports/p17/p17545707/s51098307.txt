                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with chest pain and
 pneumomediastinum seen on recent chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate linear lucency along
 the anterior mediastinum and superior cardiac silhouette, best seen on lateral
 view.  This is similar in appearance compared the prior chest radiograph, with
 any changes in configuration likely related to redistribution of existing air.
 No increased or additional lucency is identified.  The lungs are again clear,
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized
 upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Redemonstration of a small amount of pneumomediastinum, with a similar amount
 of air somewhat redistributed.
