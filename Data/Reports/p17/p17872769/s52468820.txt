                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with history of worsening shortness o fbreath, diarrhea,
 abdominal pain  // please eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT abdomen and pelvis ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again noted are bibasilar opacities, not significantly changed from the prior
 radiograph on ___.  At the right lung base, this appears to be
 due to a moderately-sized pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis as seen
 on the CT abdomen/pelvis.  However, underlying infection is difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is moderately enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild vascular congestion
 
 Right lung base opacity appears to be due to a moderately-sized pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  Superimposed infection is difficult to
 exclude.
