 above. Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
 
 There is left retrocardiac opacity, that potentially might represent a

 at definitive possibility.  Right upper lobe opacity is noted, faint but might
 represent developing infection as well.

 effusion is present. There is no pulmonary edema.
