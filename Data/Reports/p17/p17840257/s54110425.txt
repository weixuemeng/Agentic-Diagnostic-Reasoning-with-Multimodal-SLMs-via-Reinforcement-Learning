                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  2.1 x 2 cm
 diameter poorly defined nodule in periphery of the right upper lobe is
 associated with a pleural tag extending to the lateral pleural surface. 
 Multifocal bronchial wall thickening is present, particularly in the right
 perihilar region, but also within the infrahilar area on the lateral view. 
 Poorly defined opacities are present in the left retrocardiac region, and note
 is made of a small left pleural effusion.  Trace amount of fluid is also
 demonstrated within the fissures on the right.  Bones are diffusely
 demineralized, and note is made of a moderate compression deformity at
 approximately the T10 vertebral body level.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Multifocal bronchial wall thickening and patchy left lower lobe opacities,
 which could potentially be due to an acute infectious etiology given clinical
 suspicion.
 
 2.  2 cm peripheral right upper lobe lung nodule is concerning for a lung
 cancer, likely adenocarcinoma subtype.  CT of the chest is suggested for
 further evaluation.  Considering clinical suspicion for infection and other
 multifocal abnormalities in the chest on the current study, it may be
 reasonable to first complete a course of antibiotic therapy prior to CT.
 
 3.  Small left pleural effusion.  
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned with these results at 8:55 a.m. on ___ at
 time of discovery.
