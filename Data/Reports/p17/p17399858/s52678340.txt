                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of left lower lobe pneumonia with
 shortness of breath high fevers and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.   Right mid to lower and left lower lung
 opacities are identified.  Superiorly the lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits given relatively low lung
 volumes.  There is no effusion.  No acute osseous abnormality identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar and right mid lung opacities which certainly could represent
 pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.  Recommend repeat after treatment to
 document resolution with attempted improved inspiratory effort would be of
 most use.
