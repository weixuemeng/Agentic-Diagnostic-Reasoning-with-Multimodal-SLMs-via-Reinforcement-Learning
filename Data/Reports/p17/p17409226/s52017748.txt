                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of stroke episodes concerning for
 seizures coughing with crackles on exam  // Pneumonia? pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ allowing for differences in technique, no definite
 change detected.  Slight blurring may relate to motion.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, allowing for slight patient
 rotation.  The transcatheter aortic valve replacement is again noted, similar
 in configuration.
 
 There is mild upper zone redistribution.  Previously seen mild diffuse
 increased interstitial markings less apparent,  likely due to motion-related
 blurring.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion is identified.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Previous studies have demonstrated a hiatal hernia.  This likely accounts for
 the rounded area of lucency and density superimposed over the left cardiac
 silhouette on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation or gross effusion.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis
 may be present.
 2. Upper zone redistribution.
 3. Previously seen increased interstitial markings are less apparent.  I
 suspect this may be due to slight blurring from motion.
