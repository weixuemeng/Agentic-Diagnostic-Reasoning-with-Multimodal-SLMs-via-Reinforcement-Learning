                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with  altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs:  ___.
 CTA torso: ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded, with interval improvement in aeration of the
 right lower lobe compared to the prior study.  Prominent interstitial markings
 persist bilaterally compatible with a chronic interstitial abnormality,
 thought to reflect NSIP on prior CT.  There is no focal opacification
 concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in
 appearance, with stable configuration of TAVR and ascending aortic endo graft.
 A moderate hiatal hernia is again noted.  Multiple mild thoracic vertebral
 compression deformities are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Hiatal hernia, TAVR and ascending aortic
 endograft are unchanged.
