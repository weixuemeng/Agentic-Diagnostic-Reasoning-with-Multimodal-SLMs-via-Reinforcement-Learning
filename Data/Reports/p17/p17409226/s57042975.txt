                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia and new respiratory distress  //
 new infiltrate? lobar collapse?      new infiltrate? lobar collapse?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the cardiac silhouette is more
 prominent and there is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  Previously described hiatal
 hernia is again seen.
 Although there is no convincing area of acute pneumonia on this single frontal
 view, given the extensive pulmonary changes it would be very difficult to
 unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
