 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with desaturation post-op, pre-extubation. no
 known lung disease. pre-op sat ___% off supplemental oxygen.  // ?pulmonary
 edema; infiltrate     ?pulmonary edema; infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly worse than ___ years ago.  Lung volumes are
 once again quite low, and there is more pronounced bibasilar consolidation
 which could be pneumonia, but is more likely atelectasis.  The other region of
 consolidation superior to the right hilus has a similar differential
 diagnosis, but atelectasis is less likely in the nondependent lungs.  Tip of
 the endotracheal tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 5
 cm from the carina.  The chin is elevated, so the position is probably
 functional.  Small right pleural effusion is likely.  No pneumothorax.
