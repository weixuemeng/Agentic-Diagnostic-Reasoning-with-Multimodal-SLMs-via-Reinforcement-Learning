                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower GI bleed and hemodynamic instability status post total
 colectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably.
 The patient has been extubated.  The nasogastric tube follows the expected
 course, ending in the stomach which is distended with air.  The right internal
 jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC and appears kinked on this single image. 
 Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding with right basilar
 atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis.  There is no
 substantial effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  An imaged loop
 of small bowel is dilated to 6 cm.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
 
 2.  Right internal jugular catheter appears kinked on this single image. 
 Correlate with catheter function.
 
 3. Dilated small bowel, incompletely imaged.
