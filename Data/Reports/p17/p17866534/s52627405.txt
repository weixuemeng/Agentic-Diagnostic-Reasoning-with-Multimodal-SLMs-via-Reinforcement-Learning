 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post Whipple procedure, post-op day 4,
 now with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
 likely due to poor inspiration.  There has been interval extubation and
 removal of an NG tube.  The left subclavian line is unchanged.  There is
 gaseous distention of the bowel in the abdominal left upper quadrant which is
 causing elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is increased retrocardiac
 atelectasis since prior imaging.  The heart size is borderline for
 cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New gaseous distention of the bowel in the left upper quadrant. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis.  Otherwise unchanged chest radiograph.
