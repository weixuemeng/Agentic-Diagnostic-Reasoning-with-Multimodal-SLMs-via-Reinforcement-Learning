                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M on chemo, with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is top normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Patchy
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine. Partially imaged are biliary stents within the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low
 lung volumes, but infection cannot be completely excluded.
