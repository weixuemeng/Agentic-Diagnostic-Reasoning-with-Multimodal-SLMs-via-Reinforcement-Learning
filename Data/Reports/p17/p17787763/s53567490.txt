                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with right back pain s/p fall  // ? ptx, effusion, fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are relatively hyperinflated with biapical scarring.  Increased opacity
 projecting over the posterior costophrenic angle on the lateral view is
 suggestive of a small effusion, likely on the left.  There is no consolidation
 worrisome for pneumonia nor edema.  There is mild cardiac enlargement and
 dense mitral annular calcifications.  Compression deformity of a lower
 thoracic vertebral body is age indeterminate without prior.  Deformity of the
 proximal left humerus suggests prior fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable small left pleural effusion without other acute cardiopulmonary
 process.  Severe compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body, age
 indeterminate, to be correlated clinically.
