 pneumonia

 No comparison.  Flattened hemidiaphragms on the lateral image suggest moderate
 overinflation.  There is mild thickening of the peribronchial interstitium. 
 Both at the level of the right as well as of the left lung bases, potentially
 indicative of chronic bronchitis or other chronic airways disease.  However,
 no focal parenchymal abnormalities suggestive of pneumonia are seen.  Normal
 size of the heart.  Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.  No pleural
 effusions.
