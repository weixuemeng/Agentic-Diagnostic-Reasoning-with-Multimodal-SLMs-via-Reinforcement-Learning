  The newly placed right Port-A-Cath tip projects over the expected region of
  the right atrium recommend pulling back approximately 4 cm to reposition in
  the expected region of the SVC-RA junction.
  
  Bibasilar streak like opacities, likely atelectasis.  The heart appears
  enlarged.  Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, although concurrent
  edema and/or infection cannot be excluded.  Probable small left pleural
  effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate edema.  Slight prominence of the
  mediastinum may be projectional and appears similar to the appearance on the
  cross-sectional imaging from ___.  Fullness of the right hila is
  consistent with an avid hilar lymphadenopathy seen better on cross-sectional
  imaging.
