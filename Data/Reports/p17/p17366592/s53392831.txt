 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with sudden onset of dizziness and shortness of
 breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  There are diffusely
 prominent interstitial markings throughout the lungs, most notably at the lung
 bases.  There is no large confluent consolidation or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at upper limits of normal size.  Aorta is
 slightly torturous.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs without
 consolidation.  This could be due to mild interstitial edema.  Clinical
 correlation is suggested.
