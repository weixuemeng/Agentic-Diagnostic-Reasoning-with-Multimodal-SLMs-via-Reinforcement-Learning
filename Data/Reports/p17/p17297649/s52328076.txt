                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fevers  // r/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is no pulmonary opacity or mass.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are seen.  The left ventricle and left atrium are
 enlarged and a pacer with intact leads is noted, findings which are consistent
 with chronic heart failure.  There is no pulmonary edema or other evidence of
 acute heart failure.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions are seen. The right
 pulmonary artery is enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. 
 Calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.  The aorta is noted to be
 tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 2.  Enlarged left ventricle and left atrium, consistent with chronic heart
 failure.
 
 3.  Enlarged right pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
