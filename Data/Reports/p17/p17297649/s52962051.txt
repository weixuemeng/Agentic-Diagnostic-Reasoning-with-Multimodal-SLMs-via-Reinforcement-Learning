 HISTORY:  Presyncope symptoms with pacing device.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and
 right ventricle is again noted.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta
 remains tortuous with mild atherosclerotic calcifications.  Enlargement of the
 hila bilaterally is compatible with known pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No
 pulmonary edema is identified.  Linear opacities in both lung bases are
 compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified.  Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with
 multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral hilar enlargement compatible with known pulmonary artery
 hypertension.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
