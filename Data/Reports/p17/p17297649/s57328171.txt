                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with weakness. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis is seen but no focal opacity to suggest
 pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is redemonstrated, with significant
 contribution from the left ventricle and atrium as before. Left-sided
 pacemaker is redemonstrated with the leads in expected position. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The right pulmonary artery is enlarged,
 suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 No evidence of pneumonia.
