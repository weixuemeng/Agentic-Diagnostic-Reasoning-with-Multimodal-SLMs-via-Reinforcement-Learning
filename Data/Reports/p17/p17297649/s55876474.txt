                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate the lungs are well
 expanded, with prominent bilateral interstitial markings and Kerley B lines,
 compatible with interstitial edema.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion, or focal airspace opacity.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable in appearance, and a dual-lead pacemaker device is unchanged in
 position.  The aorta is tortuous, with mild atherosclerotic calcifications. 
 Enlargement of the bilateral hila is similar in appearance, compatible with
 known pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interstitial pulmonary edema, increased since the prior study. 
 Stable mild cardiomegaly.
