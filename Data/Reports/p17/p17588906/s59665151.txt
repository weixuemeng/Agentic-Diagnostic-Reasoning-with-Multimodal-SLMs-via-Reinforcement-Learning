                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs are
 clear except for stable appearance of minimal biapical pleural and parenchymal
 scarring and tiny calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe, accompanied by
 minimal volume loss with slight elevation of the right minor fissure.  No new
 concerning opacities are evident, and there are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.  Lateral view is somewhat limited due to suboptimal
 positioning of the arms, obscuring the normally clear retrosternal space. 
 This view can be repeated at no additional charge if warranted clinically.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
