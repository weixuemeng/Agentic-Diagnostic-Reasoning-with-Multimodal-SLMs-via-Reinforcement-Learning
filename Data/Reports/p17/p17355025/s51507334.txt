 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post left upper VATS segmentectomy, here
 to re-evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ and CT of the chest

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest show persistently low
 but improved inspiratory lung volumes with right lower lobe atelectasis.  The
 lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Haziness in the left upper lobe is likely post-operative. 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and likely
 post-surgical.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with a tortuous
 thoracic aorta.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
 2.  Improved but persistent low inspiratory lung volumes and right lower lobe
 atelectasis from ___.
