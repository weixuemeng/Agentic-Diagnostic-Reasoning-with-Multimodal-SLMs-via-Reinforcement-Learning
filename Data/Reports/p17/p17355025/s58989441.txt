                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left upper lobe segmentectomy with chest tube
 placement.  Please evaluate for lung expansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT chest performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiographs demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes
 with crowding of vascular structures.  Minimal pulmonary edema evident. 
 Minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may indicate small
 pleural effusions.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum and increased cardiac
 silhouette is likely reflective of portable technique, low lung volumes,
 patient positioning and postoperative state.  No osseous abnormality
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided chest tube in place.  No pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary
 edema. Post-operative appearance of cardiomediastinum.
