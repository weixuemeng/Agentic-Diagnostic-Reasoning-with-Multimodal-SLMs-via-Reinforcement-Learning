                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizure  // ?infection
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 00:40
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema are mild.  Left basilar
 opacity is worse since prior.  Right middle lobe opacity is worse since prior.
 There is likely a small left pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomegaly is mild.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsened left basilar opacity is likely due to a combination of atelectasis
 and a small effusion, but superimposed infection is also a possibility.
 2. Right middle lobe opacity is worse since prior and may be due to
 atelectasis, aspiration, and/or pneumonia.
