 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 junction.

 lobar consolidation, although predominantly basilar and perihilar fluffy
 opacities are present.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 appreciated.
 
 Multiple lateral old healed rib fractures are present bilaterally.
