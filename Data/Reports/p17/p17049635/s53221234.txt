                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 right IJ catheter that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.  The right PIC
 line appears to extend into the right atrium.  There is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Areas of opacification in the right mid and lower
 lung zones have decreased, but are still present.  Widening of the upper
 mediastinum most likely reflects some combination of longstanding adenopathy
 and fat deposition.
