                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure status post
 intubation.  Assess endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 8:00 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single view chest radiograph shows interval increase of right lung
 opacification, for increased consolidation and pleural effusion, consistent
 with pneumonia.  An ET tube has been placed with tip ending at 6.3 cm from
 carina, it can be withdrawn 1-2 cm.  NG tube ends in distal gastric cavity.
 Left lung is still clear.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. Right lower rib fracture is
 chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right lung is likely related to
 increased pleural effusion and consolidation and is suspicious for pneumonia. 
 ET tube can be pulled back 2 cm.
