                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent extubation, pulmonary infiltrates, wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 The patient has been extubated.  The trachea is slightly deviated toward the
 left.  Bilateral widespread consolidation presumed to be multifocal pneumonia
 has slightly improved on the left side at the lung base where there is less
 obscuration of the diaphragm.  Multiple healed right rib fractures are seen. 
 Right-sided jugular line ends in mid SVC.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours
 are unchanged and moderately dilated.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
 There is unchanged moderate cardiac congestion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  The patient has been extubated and there is now mild deviation of the
 trachea towards the left.  Non emergent thyroid ultrasound could be done to
 rule out a thyroid nodule.
 2.  Slight improvement at the left lung base of the bilateral lung
 consolidation .
 3.  Unchanged moderate cardiac congestion.
