                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours.  Multifocal areas of
 consolidation are present in the left upper lobe and in the right perihilar
 and basilar regions.  These findings most likely represent multifocal
 pneumonia and appear slightly increased in the right lung in the interval. 
 Probable layering right pleural effusion is unchanged.
