                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Productive cough for the past week, here to evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study and considerably lower on the lateral radiographs.  Low lung
 volumes accentuate the interstitial lung markings and cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis is greater on the left compared to the prior.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. 
 The mediastinal contours remain prominent partially due to unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  Calcification of the aortic knob is unchanged.  There is mild
 kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine and multilevel degenerative changes. 
 Surgical clips projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are
 compatible with prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
 2.  Decreased lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis greater on the left.
