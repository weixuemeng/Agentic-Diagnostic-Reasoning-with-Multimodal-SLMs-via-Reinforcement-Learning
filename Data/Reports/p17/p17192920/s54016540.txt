                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough, congestion, chest pain  // R/o pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated but clear.  Dramatic increase in lung volumes
 since the prior study raises the possibility of bronchospasm although no
 bronchial cuffing is seen. Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Clear lungs, possibly hyperinflated.  The increase in volumes from the prior
 radiograph could suggest bronchospasm.
