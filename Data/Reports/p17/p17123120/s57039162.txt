                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic SCC of the tongue, now short of breath after fluid
 resuscitation.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 A right-sided PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is mild diffuse vascular blurring,
 asymmetrically more pronounced on the right side, which could reflect mild
 CHF.  There is minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity and minimal right
 cardiophrenic opacity, most likely atelectasis.  A small left effusion is
 present.  Old right-sided rib fractures are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular blurring, right greater than left, could reflect
 mild CHF.  Small left effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
