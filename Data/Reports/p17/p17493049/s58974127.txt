                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wound to left axilla, to assess for mediastinal abnormality.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the mediastinal
 contours are essentially within normal limits.  There is prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette, which may be due in large part_ to the low lung volumes. 
 No evidence of vascular congestion, acute focal pneumonia, pneumothorax, or
 mediastinal gas.
 
 If mediastinal abnormality is a significant clinical possibility, CT would be
 the next imaging procedure.
