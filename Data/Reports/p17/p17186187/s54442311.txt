                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fever and right lower lobe rales. 
 Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Poor inspirational effort explains high position of diaphragms
 obscuring lung bases and lower half of cardiac contours.  Crowded appearance
 of basal pulmonary vasculature is noted.  There is mild blunting of the left
 lateral pleural sinus, but the right lateral pleural sinus is free.  No
 evidence of acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  No pneumothorax
 exists in the apical area.  The lateral view confirms the left-sided pleural
 effusion with moderate blunting of the posterior pleural sinus.  The right
 lateral pleural sinus is free.
 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of
 ___, the patient had remarkable high positioned diaphragms as
 well which was not unexpected in this patient with clinical history of acute
 pancreatitis.  At that time, the chest examination demonstrated the presence
 of a right-sided PICC line. This line remains visible on today's examination,
 and the line is seen to terminate in the lower third of the SVC.
