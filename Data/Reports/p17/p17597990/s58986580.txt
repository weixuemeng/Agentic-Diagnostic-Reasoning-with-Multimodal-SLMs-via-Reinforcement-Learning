                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of melanoma, evaluate
 disease status.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  The images are presented for interpretation on ___.  The heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation.  No typical
 configurational abnormality is seen, however, the left ventricular contour is
 relatively prominent to the left and posteriorly, a finding which in
 conjunction with the moderately widened and elongated thoracic aorta suggests
 a possibility of systemic hypertension.  There are some calcium deposits in
 the aortic wall at the level of the arch.  No local contour abnormality in the
 aorta can be identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no
 signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are seen.  Lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures demonstrate some
 moderate degree of degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with osteophytic
 prominences mostly anteriorly and laterally.  No vertebral body compression is
 seen.
 
 There exists no previous chest examination in our records available for
 comparison.  Listed is, however, an FDG tumor imaging of the chest as of ___ and a chest CT of ___.  No gross pulmonary pathology
 was identified.  For detailed, see corresponding reports.
