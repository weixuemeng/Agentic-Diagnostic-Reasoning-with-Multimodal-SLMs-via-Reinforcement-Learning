                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and fever, evaluate for
 focal lung lesion that may suggest pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  Observed that bilateral basal anteriorly located fat
 pads in the cardiac apical area and in the right-sided cardiodiaphragmatic
 angle obscures the lower portions of the cardiac contour.  This observation
 existed already on the previous study.  The thoracic aorta is unremarkable for
 age and no local contour abnormalities are present.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No
 pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are
 grossly unremarkable.
 
 When comparison is made with the next preceding examination of ___, the chest findings are stable and thus, there is no evidence of cardiac
 enlargement, pulmonary congestion or acute pulmonary infiltrates in this
 ___-year-old female patient with history of cough and fever.
 
 A previous chest CT of ___, was also reviewed.  Findings are
 grossly unremarkable; however, a small vascular abnormality consistent of a
 left upper lobe pulmonary vein connecting with the systemic left-sided
 brachiocephalic vein was observed.  This clinically seen minor abnormality
 cannot be identified on the plain chest examinations.
