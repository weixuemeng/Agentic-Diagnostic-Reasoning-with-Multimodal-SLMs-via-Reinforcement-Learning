                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with prolonged cough, evaluate for
 pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The heart size is unchanged, seen to be at the upper
 limit of normal variation.  No typical configurational abnormality is
 identified, however, a prominent calcification in the mitral annulus is
 observed, similar as on preceding study.  Thoracic aorta is of ordinary
 ___ but shows some calcium deposits in the wall, mostly at the level of
 the arch.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, however, the pulmonary vasculature shows
 a somewhat irregular peripheral distribution, a finding which in conjunction
 with the relatively low positioned diaphragms is suggestive of COPD.  The
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation. 
 No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area on the frontal view.  Skeletal
 structures of the thorax demonstrate diffuse moderate degree of
 demineralization of the bony structures in the thoracic spine with accentuated
 kyphotic curvature, but no conclusive evidence for vertebral body compression
 fracture.  When comparison is made with the next preceding examination of
 ___, no significant interval change can be identified.  A mild degree
 of asymmetry of the breast shadows is consistent with previously performed
 right-sided lumpectomy.  This finding is unchanged with those made on
 examination of ___, in which the request commented on previous
 breast cancer history.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, borderline heart size, but no acute
 pulmonary congestion and no evidence of acute infiltrates in a patient with
 findings compatible with COPD.
