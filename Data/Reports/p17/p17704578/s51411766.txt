                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pacemaker.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 change in the appearance of the pacer device, with its tip in the region of
 the apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of pneumothorax or acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.  Dense calcification of the mitral annulus is again
 seen.
