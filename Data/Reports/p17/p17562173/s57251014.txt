                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Breast cancer with CSF mets, presenting with seizures.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Lungs are clear.  Mild right apical pleural thickening may be secondary to
 radiation therapy.  Pleural surfaces are otherwise otherwise clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax. Prominent sclerosis of the thoracic cage is
 compatible with metastatic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
 2.  Dense bones compatible with diffuse osseous metastases.
