                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of TIA with lightheadedness, here to evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased and there is elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm.  Streaky bibasilar opacities most likely represent
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  An 8-mm calcification projecting over
 the right upper-to-mid lung zone may represent a granuloma.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Prominence of the right mediastinum is likely
 related to pronounced dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits.  The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated
 in the setting of low lung volumes.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar streaky opacities most likely represent atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.
 2.  Prominence of the right mediastinum is related to dextroconvex scoliosis
 of the thoracic spine.
