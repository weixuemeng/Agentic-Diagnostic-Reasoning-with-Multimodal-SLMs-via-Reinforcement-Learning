                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG, post pull  // eval for ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:03
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple lines and tubes have been removed including the intra-aortic balloon
 pump.  A right IJ central line remains present, tip over upper right atrium.
 
 New compared with the prior study, there is increased retrocardiac density
 alteration of the left heart border consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and there consolidation likely with associated small to moderate left-sided
 effusion.  There is minimal blunting of right costophrenic angle, without
 gross effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base medially.
 An overt CHF.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right IJ line remains present, tip over upper SVC.  Clinical correlation
 regarding retraction by approximately 2.5 cm, to lie in the lower SVC, is
 requested.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Interval development of increased opacity in the left lung base, extending up
 to the perihilar region, likely a combination of a left pleural effusion and
 underlying collapse and/or pneumonic consolidation.
