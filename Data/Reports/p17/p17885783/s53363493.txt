                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer and atrial fibrillation.  New onset of cough,
 lower extremity edema and left hand swelling, fever and shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There is no longer any pulmonary edema and previous azygos distension has
 improved, but there are still small bilateral pleural effusions.  Relatively
 mild left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened.  Heart size is top normal. 
 There are no findings to suggest pneumonia or biventricular heart failure. 
 Lower most sternal wire, seen on the lateral view, is fractured and partially
 opened.  Prior imaging studies are equivocal as to its chronicity, but there
 is no evidence of wound complication.
