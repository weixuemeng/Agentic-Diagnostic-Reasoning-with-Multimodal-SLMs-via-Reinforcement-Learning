 a couple days  // any acute process?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS:

 there is subtle linear and nodular opacity which could represent an early
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  There is a markedly torturous
 aorta.  Heart size is upper limits of normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. 
 No pneumothorax.  No large pleural effusion.  No air under the right
 hemidiaphragm.

 Subtle peripheral nodular and linear opacity in the left mid to lower lung
 peripherally raises potential concern for an early pneumonia.
