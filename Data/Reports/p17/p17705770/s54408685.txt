                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea on amiodarone.  Exclude heart failure
 and amiodarone toxicity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by mediastinal fat.  Fat is also
 responsible for thickening of the pleural margins and the contour of the upper
 mediastinum.  Mild narrowing of the trachea at the thoracic inlet could be due
 to a goiter or previous tracheostomy.  Transvenous right atrial and right
 ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  The ascending thoracic aorta is calcified and there may be mild
 fusiform dilatation of the ascending portion.  Running osteophytes in the mid
 thoracic spine are present with no loss of height or abnormal curvature.
