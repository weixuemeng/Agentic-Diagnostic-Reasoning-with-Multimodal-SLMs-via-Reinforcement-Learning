                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve
 replacement with drop in hematocrit.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right internal jugular line terminates at the level of cavoatrial
 junction.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including
 moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.  Small pleural effusion is noted bilaterally,
 left more than right.  Small amount of pneumopericardium is expected.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is slight interval increase in the
 mediastinal width.  Given the drop in hematocrit, mediastinal hematoma is a
 possibility and repeated radiograph is recommended for documentation of
 stability.  Otherwise, chest CT might be considered to exclude the possibility
 of intra-mediastinal bleeding.  No pneumothorax is seen.
