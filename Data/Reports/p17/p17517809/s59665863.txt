 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, 5:41 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recurrent fever, chills, and symptoms after
 recent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are fully expanded and clear.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes and pleural surfaces aside from tortuosity or mild dilatation of
 the ascending aorta.  Lateral view shows heavy calcification in the region of
 the aortic valve, largely coronary artery atherosclerosis, but conceivably
 obscuring some aortic valvular calcium.  There is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No findings of pneumonia.  Coronary atherosclerosis.  Cannot
 exclude aortic valvular calcification.
