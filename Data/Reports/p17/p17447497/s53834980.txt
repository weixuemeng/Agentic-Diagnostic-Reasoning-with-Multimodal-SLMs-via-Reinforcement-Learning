  1.  Bilateral lower lobe areas of opacification are slightly worsened since
  the prior chest radiograph, and may represent an ongoing infectious process,
  given the clinical history of ABPA.
  
  2.  Bilateral upper lobe nodular opacities are again seen. The left-sided
  opacity was similar in appearance on the ___ chest CT.  The right upper
  lobe opacity was seen on the chest CT of ___ (see 600b:62 of the
  prior study). These may reflect areas of scarring, given the clinical history.
  However, if there is concern for malignancy, non urgent chest CT can be
  obtained for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, dyspnea, hypoxia.  History of ABPA.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, and ___.  Chest CT of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there are worsened areas of opacification in the
 bilateral lower lobes, which may represent infection, given the patient's
 clinical history.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Nodular opacities in
 the bilateral upper lungs are again noted, similar in appearance in the left
 upper lung since the chest CT of ___.  The nodular opacity in the right
 upper lung may reflect scarring.  Unchanged old healed right posterior rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bilateral lower lobe areas of opacification are slightly worsened since
 the prior chest radiograph, and may represent an ongoing infectious process,
 given the clinical history of ABPA.
 
 2.  Bilateral upper lobe nodular opacities are again seen.  The left-sided
 opacity was similar in appearance on the ___ chest CT.  The right upper
 lobe opacity was seen on the chest CT of ___ (see 600b:62 of the
 prior study).  These may reflect areas of scarring, given the clinical
 history.  However, if there is concern for malignancy, non urgent chest CT can
 be obtained for further evaluation and to evaluate for interval stability by
 CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If there is concern for malignancy, non urgent chest CT
 can be obtained for further evaluation of bilateral upper lobe nodular
 opacities.
