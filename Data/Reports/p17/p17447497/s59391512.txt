                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Asthma, chills, and shortness of breath.  History of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Superimposed on
 pre-existing heterogeneous interstitial abnormalities are areas of increased
 and new opacification.  Areas where opacification has increased include the
 right upper lobe, the medial right lung base.  However left perihilar
 opacification has decreased.  There is slight increase in density of opacity
 projecting over the left lateral chest wall which suggests atelectasis and
 perhaps loculated pleural fluid.  At this site there is a more clearly visible
 but probably subacute fracture with lysis.  The lysis is possibly due to
 healing, although not ineffective healing; it is less likely but not possible
 to exclude pathological fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall worsening of multifocal heterogeneous opacities concerning for
 worsening of chronic infectious process although etiology is indeterminant. 
 Lytic change and non-displaced fracture along the left posterior lateral sixth
 although probably subacute or older; appearance may reflect ineffective
 healing response.  Because a pathological fracture is not excluded, it may be
 appropriate to reassess with follow-up radiographs.
