                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dypsnea, hypoxia. Assess for acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Again seen are extensive bilateral opacities
 similar prior studies limiting evaluation for superimposed infection. Subtle
 increase in heterogeneous opacity within the right lower lobe noted. 
 Increasing opacity projecting over the right upper lobe. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 Healed rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On a background of chronic bronchiectasis and increased lung markings, there
 is increased right suprahilar opacity and possible right lower lobe opacity
 compared to the prior examination. This may reflect extension of the known
 process, however chest CT would be helpful for further evaluation as infection
 is difficult to exclude.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 3:39 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
