                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, cough, and fatigue.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 large area of consolidation in the right upper lobe, mostly posteriorly,
 highly worrisome for pneumonia.  There are additional areas of opacity in the
 bilateral lung bases, which are similar in comparison to the prior study and
 may relate to patient's chronic interstitial lung disease.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable and unremarkable.  Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again
 seen.  Linear opacity projecting over the left lateral upper-to-mid thorax is
 stable and chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large area of right upper lobe consolidation consistent with
 pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution.  Interstitial opacities again
 seen at the lung bases may be due to chronic interstitial lung disease with
 possible overlying edema.
