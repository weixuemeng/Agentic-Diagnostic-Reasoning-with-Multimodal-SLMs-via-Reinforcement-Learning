                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally is re- demonstrated in
 this patient with chronic lung disease.  There is slight increase in opacities
 bilaterally, which may be due to acute worsening of chronic lung disease
 versus overlying mild edema versus superimposed infectious process.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are grossly
 stable.  There is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which
 could be due to trace pleural effusions versus pleural thickening multiple rib
 deformities on the right are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstrated chronic lung disease.  Interval increase in opacity in the
 lungs bilaterally, particularly at the lung bases which may be due to
 superimposed infection, worsening of chronic lung disease, or superimposed
 edema.
