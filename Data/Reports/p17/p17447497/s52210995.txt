                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with chest pressure, cough, dyspnea  // Eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As seen on prior, there is diffuse interstitial abnormality compatible with
 bronchiectasis and scarring.  There are more confluent regions of
 consolidation at the right lung base in the middle lobe and in the right
 suprahilar region.  There is no effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities compatible with bronchiectasis and
 scarring with more confluent regions of consolidation on the right
 particularly in the middle lobe which could represent superimposed infection
 versus atelectasis.
