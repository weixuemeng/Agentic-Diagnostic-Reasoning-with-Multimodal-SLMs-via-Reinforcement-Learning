                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea  // Acute cardiopulmonary diseas
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph, there is a new heterogeneous opacity at the right
 lung base with suggestion of a small right pleural effusion.  Lungs are
 otherwise notable for increased interstitial markings bilaterally likely due
 to chronic disease as seen on prior CT scan. The cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.No pneumothorax. Old bilateral rib fractures are again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic lung changes with more confluent right basilar opacity worrisome for
 pneumonia with possible small adjacent pleural effusion.
