                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Productive cough, fever, chills, and reduced breath sounds
 bilaterally, more so on the right than left.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDOINGS: Superimposed on background lung abnormalities is a suspected
 opacity of greater acuity involving the lingula and possibly the left anterior
 medial segment of the left lower lobe.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear stable.  Similar reverse S-shaped curvature is present
 along the visualized thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New lingular and possibly left lower lobe opacity superimposed on
 more chronic long-term pulmonary abnormalities.  This appearance is worrisome
 for superimposed pyogenic bacterial infection or possibly an exacerbation of
 suspected chronic infection, possibly due to atypical mycobacterial etiology.
