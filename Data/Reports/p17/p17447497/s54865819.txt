                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  ABPA and cough, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There has been considerable improvement in opacity in the
 right middle lobe.  A nodular density projecting over the left lateral upper
 lobe and perihilar opacities appear similar.  Lungs appear hyperinflated. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Prior healed right lateral
 sixth through eighth rib fractures appear unchanged.  There is mild rightward
 convex curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement in right middle lobe opacity with persistent
 patchy opacities that can probably be attributed to chronic disease; however
 subtle acute on chronic disease is difficult to entirely exclude.
