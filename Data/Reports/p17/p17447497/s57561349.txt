                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pleuritic chest pain with history of COPD  //
 Possible pneumonia vs. COPD exacberation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Prominence of the
 main pulmonary artery suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Coarse interstitial opacities with bronchial wall thickening and diffuse
 bronchiectasis is re- demonstrated, with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities
 appearing more pronounced in the lung bases compared to the previous study. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes are present with chronic bilateral rib deformities again noted. 
 Compression deformities of ___ mid thoracic vertebral bodies appears slightly
 progressed compared to the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bronchiectasis and airway inflammation with coarse interstitial
 opacities compatible with chronic atypical infection such as ___. The presence
 of increased patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, however, is concerning for
 superimposed or worsening infection.
