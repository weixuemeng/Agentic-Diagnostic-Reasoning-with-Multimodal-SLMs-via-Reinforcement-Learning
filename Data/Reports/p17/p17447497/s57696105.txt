                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough, shortness of breath, and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the latest from ___ and a CT
 of the chest from ___.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are well expanded and show diffuse interstitial opacities.  These
 have mildly progressed compared to the previous examination.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 hilar contours are normal.  Note is made of healed fractures on the right
 ribs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities have mildly progressed and likely represent a
 combination of chronic interstitial lung disease with overlying edema.
