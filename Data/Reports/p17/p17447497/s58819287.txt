                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Interstitial opacities predominantly
 within the lung bases appear similar compared to prior examination and
 correspond with known bronchiectasis.  Mild prominence of the upper lung
 vasculature suggests new superimposed vascular congestion; however, there is
 no overt edema or large effusions.  No confluent consolidation is identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.  Healed right-sided rib fractures are unchanged from
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Stable basilar interstitial markings consistent with known bronchiectasis.
 No superimposed confluent consolidation.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt edema or large
 effusions.
