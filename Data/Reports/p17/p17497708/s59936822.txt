                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The patient is rotated
 somewhat to the left.  Again seen is a moderate left pleural effusion with
 underlying atelectasis, underlying left lower lung consolidation is difficult
 to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.  Slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle persists and there is likely also a small right pleural
 effusion.  There is increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
 suggesting mild edema.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  Cardiomegaly
 persists.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Likely small right pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema. 
 Persistent cardiomegaly.
