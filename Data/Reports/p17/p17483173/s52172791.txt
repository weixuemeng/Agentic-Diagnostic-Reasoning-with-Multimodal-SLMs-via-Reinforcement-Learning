 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as a result, and appears

 atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic knob. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is demonstrated. No pulmonary edema is seen.
 Minimal atelectasis is noted at the lung bases without focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are moderate multilevel degenerative
 changes seen in the thoracic spine as well as involving the right glenohumeral
 and acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
