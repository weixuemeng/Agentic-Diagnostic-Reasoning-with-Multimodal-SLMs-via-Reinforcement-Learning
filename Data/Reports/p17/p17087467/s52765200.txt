                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known COPD, with worsening respiratory distress.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a persistent left pleural effusion with associated volume
 loss, not significantly changed from the prior exam.  A small right linear
 consolidation is likely atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes. 
 Again, diffuse interstitial abnormalities are present.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The size of the
 heart is somewhat difficult to evaluate given the volume loss and adjacent
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  No significant change in the left lower lobe volume loss and
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable interstitial abnormalities which may be related to COPD, although
 pulmonary fibrosis is a consideration.  If clinically indicated, could better
 evaluate with a CT of the chest.
