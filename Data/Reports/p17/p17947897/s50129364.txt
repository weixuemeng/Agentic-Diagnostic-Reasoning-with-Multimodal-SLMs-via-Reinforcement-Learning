                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Patient with history of aortic stenosis, status post
 aortic valve replacement and bypass graft surgery.  Patient returns with
 tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Preoperative radiographs from ___ as well as more
 recent radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post aortic valve replacement.  Vague right
 mid lung opacity has improved somewhat.  Chronic-appearing changes in the
 right lung including right apical pleural thickening, patchy opacities, and
 rib deformities appear otherwise stable since preoperative radiographs. 
 Patchy left basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis has improved somewhat since
 the more recent prior radiographs, and a small left-sided pleural effusion
 appears similar to decreased.  Mild degenerative changes are similar along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving opacities within the background of chronic changes in
 the right hemithorax.
