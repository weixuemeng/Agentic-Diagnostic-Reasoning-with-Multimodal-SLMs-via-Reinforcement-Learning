                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall with non-productive cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest.  No prior.  Lungs are
 hyperinflated.  Diffusely increased interstitial markings are seen throughout
 most suggestive of a chronic underlying lung disease.  Bi-apical scarring with
 superior retraction of the hila.  There is no evidence of large confluent
 consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are notable for an upper thoracic dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of COPD with bi-apical scarring.  No definite
 acute cardiopulmonary process, although subtle changes could be missed given
 diffuse parenchymal abnormalities.
