                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs
 appear hyperinflated.  Irregular pulmonary architecture is suggestive of
 emphysema.  Scarring at each lung apex is again widespread.  Although mostly
 similar, there is a newly apparent nodular focus at the right apex whose
 better defined portion measures about 7 mm in diameter with surrounding vague
 patchy opacity which has also increased.  Otherwise, chest findings appear
 stable.  Moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the
 mid-to-upper thoracic spine.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increased nodular density at the right lung apex in the setting of
 suspected emphysema.  A true pulmonary nodule should be considered as a
 possible etiology and chest CT performed when clinically appropriate.  
 
 2.  No definite evidence of acute disease.
 
 Findings entered into the ED dashboard while the patient was still in the ER.
