                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification in the right middle lobe which developed between ___
 and ___ has not cleared.  This could be atelectasis.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged since ___.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or edema.
 
 Middle lobe atelectasis, though it has failed to clear in three months, does
 not necessarily indicate bronchial occlusion by either a foreign body or
 tumor.  Could be atelectatic just because of displacement by the very large
 right atrium.  CT scanning might be able to make that distinction between the
 two.
 
 Given the relative stability over three months, neither the right middle lobe
 findings nor any other in the chest is thought to represent pneumonia.
