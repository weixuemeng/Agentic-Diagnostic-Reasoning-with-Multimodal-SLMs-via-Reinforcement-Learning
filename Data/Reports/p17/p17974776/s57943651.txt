  Retrocardiac opacity and less pronounced right basal opacities in the
  postoperative setting are most likely atelectasis though in the context of
  fever to 102 infection can't be excluded.  Additionally fullness of the mid
  pulmonary vessels suggests mild vascular congestion without overt edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient first day after exploratory
 laparotomy, right salpingectomy and removal of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, now
 with fever.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior chest radiographs
 available for comparison.  Heart size is top normal.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is substantial and although might represent area of atelectasis,
 infectious process in this location is a possibility.  Aspiration would be
 another option.  Bilateral basal linear opacities are consistent with
 atelectasis.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Clips are
 projecting over the upper chest, the origin is unclear related to prior
 surgery.
