                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, hypotension, active chemotherapy. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Catheter of an accessed right chest wall port terminates in lower SVC. A right
 pleural tube is similar to prior. Left lower lung opacity silhouettes the left
 hemidiaphragm and is consistent with a combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Underlying infection cannot be excluded. There is additionally a
 small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Multiple bilateral
 nodular opacities are again seen, consistent with known metastatic disease.
 Heart size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase in moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent
 atelectasis. Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
 2.  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and stable position
 of right pleural tube.
 3.  Multiple bilateral nodular opacities consistent with known metastatic
 disease.
