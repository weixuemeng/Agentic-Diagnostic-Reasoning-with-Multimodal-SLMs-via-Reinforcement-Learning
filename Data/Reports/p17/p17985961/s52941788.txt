                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAH s/p trach s/p dobhoff  // trach
 placement dobhoff placement      trach placement dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 04:52.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New tracheostomy tube is midline.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal
 widening.
 
 Substantial atelectasis persists at the right lung base, and decrease in lung
 volumes generally is probably responsible for vascular crowding and platelike
 atelectasis at the left base.  Heart size is normal but increased since
 earlier in the day and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests volume overload
 or early cardiac decompensation.
