                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chf and complicated effusion s/p chest tube 
 // assess ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 601 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Transvenous atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads with left pectoral
 generator are unchanged.  Right IJ central line with tip over the upper right
 atrium is unchanged.
 
 Right-sided chest tube is new.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with a large cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, similar to the prior film.  Again seen is opacification at the
 right base which likely represents a combination of a right effusion and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The right pleural effusion may be
 very slightly smaller.  Faint blurring in the upper zones bilaterally likely
 reflects CHF, also similar to the prior study.
 
 Equivocal area of more confluent density in the upper right lung laterally,
 though I suspect that this is artifact due to overlying iatrogenic device. 
 There is atelectasis in the retro cardio region, similar prior.  No gross left
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right chest tube.  Opacification at the right base a is
 overall similar, with possible slight decrease in the size of the right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Probable CHF and left base atelectasis.
 
 Ill-defined confluent opacity in the right upper chest laterally most likely
 represents artifact due to overlying materials.  Attention to this area on
 followup films is requested.
