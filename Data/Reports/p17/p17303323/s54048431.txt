                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with shortness of breath.  Evaluate
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and CTA chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes have decreased since the prior exam.  Central bronchovascular
 congestion persists despite low volumes.  Opacity in the right lower lobe
 persists.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is
 moderate.  Prominence of the pulmonary artery is are better assessed on the
 prior CT.  Left cardiac pacer defibrillator is unchanged.  Median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal are also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent right lower lobe opacity, thought to be pneumonia on CT. 
 Recommend follow-up imaging 6 weeks after treatment to ensure resolution and
 exclude underlying lesion.
 
 2.  Lower lung volumes.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up imaging 6 weeks after treatment to ensure
 complete resolution of right lower lobe opacity exclude underlying lesion.
