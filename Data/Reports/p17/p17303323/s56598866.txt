                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF (LVEF ___%) and empyema now s/p chest
 tube placement  // Please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 21:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, significantly lower than on the most recent
 prior chest radiograph.
 
 Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably similar in
 size.  The left-sided pacemaker type device and right IJ lines are similar in
 configuration.
 
 Right-sided pleural drain is again noted, also similar in configuration.  The
 previously seen right effusion is smaller.  Curvilinear lucency at the right
 lung base raises the question of a small pneumothorax at the right lung base
 versus ___ artifact.  Some confluent opacity at the right lung base is
 compatible with residual collapse and/___ consolidation.  The area of opacity
 questioned along the upper right chest wall on the most recent prior film is
 no longer visualized, likely represent artifact.
 
 As before, the left lung base is obscured obscured by the generator device. 
 There is probably some subsegmental atelectasis at the right base, slightly
 more pronounced on the prior study.
 
 Mild vascular plethora is present, likely accentuated by low inspiratory
 volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Considerable improvement in right pleural effusion.  New linear lucency at the
 right lung base could reflect either a small pneumothorax ___ ___ artifact. 
 Residual collapse and/___ pneumonic consolidation at the right base is present.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Atelectasis at the left base probably slightly
 increased.
 
 Mild vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
