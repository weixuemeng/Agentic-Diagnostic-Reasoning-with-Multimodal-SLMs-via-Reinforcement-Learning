                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right upper quadrant abdominal pain,
 hypotension, recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The left-sided AICD
 device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle.  Left PICC tip as well as a right-sided dual-lumen central venous
 catheter tip terminates in the low SVC.  Moderate cardiomegaly is again
 demonstrated, unchanged.  There is persistent mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 present.  Persistent right basilar patchy opacity reflects known improving
 pneumonia, better assessed on recent CT.  No acute osseous abnormalities
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent patchy right basilar opacity compatible with improving pneumonia,
 better assessed on recent CT.  No new focal consolidation.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
