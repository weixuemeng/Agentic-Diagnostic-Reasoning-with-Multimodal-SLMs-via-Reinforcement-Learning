                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery and placement of a
 single lead pacemaker whose tip terminates in the right ventricle.  Heart is
 again mild to moderately enlarged.  Central pulmonary arteries are probably
 enlarged and appear increased in size as best depicted on the lateral view. 
 Mild fissural thickening suggests vascular congestion.  Regional opacification
 in the right upper lung has resolved.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.

 Very mild pulmonary vascular congestion and increased enlargement of central
 pulmonary arteries.
