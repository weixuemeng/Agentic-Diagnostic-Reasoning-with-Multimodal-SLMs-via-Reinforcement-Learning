  1.  Linear plate like atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
  2. Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe is most consistent
  atelectasis however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Of note CT is
  more sensitive in detection of atypical infection in immunocompromised
  patients.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Fever on chemotherapy.  Assess for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates a linear plate like opacity
 within the left lower lobe most consistent with platelike atelectasis. 
 Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is only seen on frontal view. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila
 are unremarkable.
 
 A right porta cath tip is seen in the low SVC.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Linear plate like atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
 2.  Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe is most consistent
 atelectasis however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Of note CT is
 more sensitive in detection of atypical infection in immunocompromised
 patients.
