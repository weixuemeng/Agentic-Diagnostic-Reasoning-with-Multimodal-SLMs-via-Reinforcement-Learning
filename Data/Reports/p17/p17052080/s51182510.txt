                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right upper quadrant pain and fevers.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is new since ___.  There is calcification of the aortic
 knob.  Increased interstitial lung markings are compatible with mild pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases may represent atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded.  Minimal costophrenic blunting on lateral view
 suggests small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Osseous structures are unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign bodies are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude
 infection.  
 2.  New mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusion.
