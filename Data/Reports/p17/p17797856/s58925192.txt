                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with SOB  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature are within normal limits, except for prominence of the pulmonary
 hila.  These have a tapered appearance and this could reflect pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  Minimal blunting of the
 costophrenic angles is unchanged and may relate top hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute pulmonary process identified.  In particular, no focal infiltrate
 identified to suggest pneumonia.
 
 Hyperinflation compatible with COPD, similar to prior.
 
 Prominence of the pulmonary arteries raises the possibility of pulmonary
 hypertension.
 
 Small nodules seen on a ___ chest CT are not appreciated
 radiographically.
