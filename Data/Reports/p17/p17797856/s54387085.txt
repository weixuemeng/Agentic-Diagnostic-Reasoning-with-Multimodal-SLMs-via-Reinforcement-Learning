                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fatigue.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs.  A prominent
 main pulmonary arterial notch may suggest mild pulmonary arterial enlargement.
 Otherwise, the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Increased
 volume of anterior clear space and flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of
 hyperinflation, possibly in the setting of COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Hyperinflation of the lungs, suggestive of COPD.
