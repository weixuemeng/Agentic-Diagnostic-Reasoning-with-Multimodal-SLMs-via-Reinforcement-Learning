                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency at the bilateral
 lung apices suggestive of COPD/emphysema.  There has been interval development
 of small bilateral pleural effusions from ___.  Streaky opacities in
 the bilateral bases most likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation
 or pneumothorax is detected.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and
 there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged from
 the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions from ___.
 2.  Stable findings of COPD/emphysema.
