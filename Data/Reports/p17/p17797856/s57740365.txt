                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is lordotic.  Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
 with the heart size within normal limits.  Prominence of the main pulmonary
 artery again raises concern for underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Lungs are hyperinflated with
 flattening of the diaphragms and attenuation of the upper lobe vascular
 markings compatible with emphysema.  No focal consolidation.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Emphysema.  Enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension,
 unchanged.
