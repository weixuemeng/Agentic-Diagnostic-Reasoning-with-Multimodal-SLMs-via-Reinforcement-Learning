 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with flail mitral leaflet, pulm edema, now with

 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 05:23, there has been improvement in the
 consolidative opacity seen in both lungs medially and at both lung bases. 
 Previously seen coronal pleural effusions are considerably increased.
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is similar to the prior study.  There is upper

 consolidation is identified
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, similar to prior.  Upper zone redistribution, without other
