                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with severe cough.  Rule out atypical pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear, although hyperexpanded. A slight increase in
 the radiodensity of the right hilus as compared to the prior radiograph is
 perhaps not of clinical significance, but if there is clinical concern, a CT
 could be used to better evaluate the airways. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  1) Emphysema 2) Slight increase in the radiodensity of the right
 hilus. Evaluation of airways with chest CT can be considered if the clinical
 scenario justifies this.
