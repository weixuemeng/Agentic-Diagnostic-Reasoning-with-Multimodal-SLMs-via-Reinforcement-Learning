                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with low o2, fever, cough  // pneumonia
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, asymmetrically distributed
 perihilar regions of consolidation are new, more severe on the right than the
 left.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new in the interval.  Heart
 is upper limits of normal in size and is slightly larger than on the prior
 study, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and scattered basilar
 interstitial opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetrically distributed perihilar airspace opacities are concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia in the setting of fever and cough.  Coexisting
 interstitial opacities could reflect an atypical pneumonia but are more likely
 due to interstitial edema in the setting of pulmonary vascular congestion and
 new small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Considering the complexity of the chest radiograph
 findings, followup radiographs are recommended in ___ weeks to ensure
 resolution following appropriate antibiotic therapy.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 10:42 into the Department of Radiology
 critical communications system for direct communication to the referring
 provider.
