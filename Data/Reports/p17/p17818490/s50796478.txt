                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Syncope and fatigue.  Rule out infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Even allowing for projection, there may well be a degree of
 cardiomegaly.  There is poor visualization of the left costophrenic sulcus,
 not significantly changed from before.  There is no good evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary process.  There is multilevel degenerative change of the
 visualized spine.  There is a questionable irregularity of the surgical neck
 of the right humerus for which dedicated imaging as appropriate might be
 useful.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No acute pathology.  Little interval change from prior study.
