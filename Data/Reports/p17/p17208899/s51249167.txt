                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Concern for pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 The lung apices are obscured by the patient's head. The heart is mildly
 enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 lung volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Linear
 bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is
 detected.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis secondary to
 low lung volumes.  No consolidations detected.
