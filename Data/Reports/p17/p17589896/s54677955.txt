                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Question
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung
 volumes, with perihilar bronchovascular crowding. No overt CHF.
 There is a small focal opacity in the lower lobe posteriorly, probably on the
 right -- ? atelectasis or a small amount of pleural fluid, but an early
 pneumonic infiltrate in this area cannot be excluded. There is no
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Mild blunting of posterior costophrenic angle -- early pneumonic infiltrate
 in this area cannot be excluded. This should be followed to resolution.
