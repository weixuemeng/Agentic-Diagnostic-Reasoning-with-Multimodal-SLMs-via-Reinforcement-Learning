                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate cardiomegaly appears somewhat smaller than compared to
 ___ with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  Left-sided dual-lead
 pacer is unchanged in position.  There is a central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement with moderate right greather than left layering bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is a suggestion of minimal interstitial edema.  There is
 leftward mediastinal shift.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible minimal
 interstitial edema and moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions.  There
 is leftward mediastinal shift either caused by right sided effusion or left
 lower lobe collapse/infection.  Lateral view would be helpful for
 characterization.
