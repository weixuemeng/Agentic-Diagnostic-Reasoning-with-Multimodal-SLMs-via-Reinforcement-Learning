                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever, leukocytosis, and ? obscured heart
 border at left lung  // eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Since a recent chest radiograph of earlier the same date, there has been
 improvement in the extent of pulmonary edema with residual moderate
 asymmetrical edema remaining. Left lower lobe and lingular opacities have
 slightly improved, and could be due to a combination of atelectasis and
 dependent edema, and less likely an infectious process. No other substantial
 interval change.
