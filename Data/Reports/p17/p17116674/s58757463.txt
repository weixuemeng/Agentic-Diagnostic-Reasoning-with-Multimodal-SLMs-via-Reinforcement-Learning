  1. Interval progression of mild to moderate interstitial edema. 2. Persistent
  patchy opacities at the lung bases bilaterally may be secondary to atelectasis
  however superimposed infectious process can't be excluded. 3. Interval
  increase in small pleural effusion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new onset fever  // eval for PNA
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the recent radiograph of ___, moderate edema has worsened.
 Increasing confluent opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe could reflect
 atelectasis and dependent edema, but infection is an additional consideration
 in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions have
 slightly increased in size appear
