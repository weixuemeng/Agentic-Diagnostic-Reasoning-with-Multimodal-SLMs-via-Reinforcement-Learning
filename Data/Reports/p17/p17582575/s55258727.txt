                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dizziness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart size is top normal with a left ventricular configuration. The aorta
 is mildly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Streaky retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
 Remainder of the lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Multiple remote left-sided rib
 fractures are demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities otherwise seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Retrocardiac streaky opacity likely atelectasis.
