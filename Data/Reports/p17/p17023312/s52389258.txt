 HISTORY:  Thoracotomy, to assess for bleeding.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices are unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacifications are again seen.  This most likely reflects pulmonary edema with
 layering effusions.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
