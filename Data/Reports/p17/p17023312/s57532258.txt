                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest tube removal, please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 28 mm above the carina.  The
 remainder of the lines and tubes are in appropriate position.  There has been
 interval removal of a right-sided chest tube compared to the prior exam.  No
 definite pneumothorax is identified.  There has been interval increase in
 consolidation at the left lung base which could be secondary to atelectasis;
 however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is a stable
 moderate right and small left-sided pleural effusions.  Again seen is
 pulmonary vascular engorgement with stable mild bilateral pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post removal of the right-sided chest tube without evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Interval worsening of left basilar consolidation which could be secondary
 to atelectasis, however an infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 3.  Stable moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
