 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:29 AM
  ET tube terminates in the left mainstem bronchus. Recommend pulling back 3-4
  cm for appropriate positioning. Opacity in the right upper lung likely
  reflects right upper lobe collapse in the setting of left mainstem bronchus
  intubation. Repeat radiographs after repositioning of the ET tube are
  recommended to evaluate for re-expansion. These findings were communicated to
  ___ at 8:18 p.m. on ___ by phone.--___

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with zenker's diverticulum s/p esophagoscopy
 and food removal.  // Evidence of esophageal perf s/p esophagoscopy and
 removal of food from zenkers     Evidence of esophageal perf s/p esophagoscopy
 and removal of
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:34
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip of
 the left mainstem bronchus. Repositioning is recommended and a wet reading was
 provided to Dr. ___ on ___ at 20:18. New opacity in the right
 upper lobe consistent with right upper lobe collapse.  Remaining right lung
 and left lung are clear. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable.
