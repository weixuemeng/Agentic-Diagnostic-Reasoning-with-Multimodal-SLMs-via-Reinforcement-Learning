                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:41 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with malignancy and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild increase in diameter of the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette,
 mediastinal veins, and new interstitial edema suggest cardiac decompensation,
 perhaps due to volume overload.  Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Expansile lytic lesion of the left fourth rib
 posterolaterally is not well imaged by this study.
