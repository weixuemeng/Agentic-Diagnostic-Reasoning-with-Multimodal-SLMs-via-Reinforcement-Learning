                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Flu-like symptoms, cough for 1 week.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam.  This results in
 accentuation of the cardiac silhouette size which is likely borderline
 enlarged.  The aorta is mildly unfolded.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal. 
 Minimal left basilar streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with left basilar streaky opacity most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
