                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with dementia, pneumonia, presenting with lethargy; rule
 out acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient was treated in ___ with radiotherapy for right lung cancer. 
 Right volume is low with apical pleural thickening.  There is reticulation
 overlying the right lung and left lung base of unknown chronicity.  Surgical
 clips are seen in the mediastinum.  The descending aorta is either tortuous or
 dilated.  A stent graft is seen in the upper abdomen, probably in the aorta. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The patient was treated in ___ by radiotherapy for right lung cancer. 
 Without any prior comparison, it is impossible to assess if the lung opacities
 and right apical pleural thickening are acute or chronic.  The best thing
 would be to get the prior exams from outside hospital and if needed, a repeat
 CT scan here could be done. 
 
  This was discussed with Dr. ___.
