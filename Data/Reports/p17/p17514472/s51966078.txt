                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia  // ? pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Low lung volumes exaggerate the hilar and
 mediastinal contours with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  There may be
 a small left pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Note is
 made of an opacity of the left lung base and medial right lung base which may
 represent atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should be considered.
 The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity at the left lung base and medial right lung base, may be secondary to
 atelectasis, however an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
