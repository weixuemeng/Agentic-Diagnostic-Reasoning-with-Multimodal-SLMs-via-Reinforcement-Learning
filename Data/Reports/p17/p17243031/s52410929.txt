                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubation, assess tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm above the carina.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis and scarring is seen without pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac
 opacity could reflect atelectasis as well.  There is no pneumothorax, with
 normal cardiomediastinal contours. Nasogastric tube terminates in the distal
 esophagus and could be advanced 10 cm. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal tube, though nasogastric
 tube could be advanced 10 cm for more optimal positioning.
