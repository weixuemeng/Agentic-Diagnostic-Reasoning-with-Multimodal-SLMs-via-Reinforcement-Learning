                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Abnormal feeling during deep inspiration.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is enlarged, but stable.  Mediastinum is stable.  Post-sternotomy
 wires are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  Lungs are slightly hyperinflated, unchanged since the prior study. 
 Overall, there are no findings to explain patient's symptoms.  If clinically
 warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered to
 exclude the possibility of radiographically occult lesion.
