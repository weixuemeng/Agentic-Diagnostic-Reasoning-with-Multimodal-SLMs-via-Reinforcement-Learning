                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with weakness  // acute cardiopulm disease
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.  Left
 pectoral pacemaker. The pacemaker leads are in correct position.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax, no pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Moderate
 elongation of the descending aorta.  Millimetric calcified granuloma in the
 right lung apex.  A zone of minimally increased radiodensity projects over the
 medial border of the right scapula and likely reflect locally increased bone
 density.  To rule out any intrapulmonary process, however, a lordotic view
 could be performed.
