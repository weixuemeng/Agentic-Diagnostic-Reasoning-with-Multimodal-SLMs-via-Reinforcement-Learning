                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some of the bronchovascular
 crowding. However, there are still bilateral diffusely increased interstitial
 opacities particularly in the right upper lobe as well as cephalization of the
 vessels compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and edema.  There
 is no large pleural effusion.  There is also peribronchial cuffing,
 particularly evident in the right infra-hila region.
 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are unchanged as is the mild
 cardiomegaly.  Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are once again
 present with several lower thoracic vertebral bodies being slightly compressed
 anteriorly. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema
 2. Peribronchial cuffing which can be seen in edema, but also bronchiolitis.
