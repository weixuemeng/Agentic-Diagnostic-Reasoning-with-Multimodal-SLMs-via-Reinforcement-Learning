                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Leukocytosis, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, though the
 pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.  No definite
 pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia at this time.
 
 There is again some soft tissue prominence in the right apical region, but
 this has been stable for at least ___ years and therefore is of no clinical
 significance.
