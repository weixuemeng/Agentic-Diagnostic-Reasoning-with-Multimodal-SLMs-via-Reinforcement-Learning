                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain and palpitations.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia or fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding.
 There are bilateral diffuse increased interstitial opacities.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Atherosclerotic
 calcifications of the aortic arch are present, and the aorta is unfolded. 
 Mild enlargement of the heart size is likely due to low lung volumes.
 Degenerative changes are again seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
