                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath, dullness at bases.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
 overlying atelectasis.  There are multiple areas of opacity in the lungs
 involving the bilateral upper lobes, right greater than left; right middle
 lobe and lingula, as well as the lower lobes.  While findings may be due to
 severe multifocal infection, other etiologies such as metastatic disease
 should be considered and needs to be excluded.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 The cardiac silhouette size is grossly stable as compared to the prior study. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Extensive
 multifocal opacities bilaterally, as above, concerning for severe multifocal
 infection, however, recommend followup to resolution as underlying metastatic
 disease/malignancy should be excluded.
