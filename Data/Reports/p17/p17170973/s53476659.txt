                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypotension, hypoglycemia, new oxygen requirement.
 Evaluate for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery seen by mediastinal surgical clips
 and median sternotomy wires. The heart is moderately enlarged and lung volumes
 are decreased. Pulmonary vascular and central venous congestion is noted.
 Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. No large pleural
 effusion.  The trachea is mildly deviated towards the right and narrowed,
 which may be secondary to chronic lung disease and displacement from the
 aorta, however displacement from a mediastinal mass is a possibility.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 -Pulmonary and central vascular congestion.
 -Moderate cardiomegaly
 -Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
 - Narrowing and rightward deviation of the trachea may be a function of
 chronic lung disease and anatomic displacement of the aorta, however a mass,
 usually a descending goiter, could have the same appearance.
