                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ extensive stage SCLC (s/p endobronchial stent placement on
 ___ for malignant obstruction and C1D11 ___/etop w/ neulasta on D4),
 diastolic dysfunction, AF, HTN who p/w worsening cough and neutropenia.
 Neutropenia now resolved. Had CXR yesterday with concerning findings, but want
 lateral to further characterize  // PA/LAT to further characterize yesterday's
 CXRHAD PERICARDIAL EFFUSION, ? PNA, and PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION PA/LAT
 to further characterize yesterday's CXRHAD PERICARDIAL EFFUSION, ? PNA, and
 PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Some improvement in left lower lobe consolidation accompanied by a return of
 the mediastinum to the midline suggests that much of that was atelectasis. 
 Moderate volume of atelectasis persists at both lung bases, and there are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette
 is chronic.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 Right PIC line ends approximately a cm below the estimated location of the
 superior cavoatrial junction.
