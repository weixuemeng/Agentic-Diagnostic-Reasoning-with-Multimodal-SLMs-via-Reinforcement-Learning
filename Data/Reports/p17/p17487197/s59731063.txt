                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with persistent cough, diffuse rhonchi on exam.
 Reports extensive mold exposure at home.  // eval for parenchymal
 abnormalities
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The lung volumes are normal.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Normal
 hilar and mediastinal structures.  The structure and transparency of the lung
 parenchyma is unremarkable.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia, no diffuse
 lung disease, no pneumothorax.
 
 If clinical symptoms persist, CT of the thorax should be considered, even in
 the light of an unremarkable chest radiograph, given the superior sensitivity
 of this technique to detect subtle parenchymal changes.
