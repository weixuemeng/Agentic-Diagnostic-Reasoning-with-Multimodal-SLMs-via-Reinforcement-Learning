                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  History of COPD.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged,
 including mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The heart is normal in size. 
 Pleural effusions have resolved.  Lung volumes are low, and in that setting
 predominantly streaky basilar opacities may be seen with atelectasis. 
 Developing pneumonia is possible, however, particularly at the left lung base
 where opacity is more ill-defined.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible developing opacity at the left lung base, for which
 correlation with clinical presentation is recommended.  It is probably within
 the lingula noting silhouetting of the left cardiac border.  A streaky right
 basilar opacity appears similar to a prior chest CT finding.
