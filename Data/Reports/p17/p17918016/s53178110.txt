                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Increased shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  Allowing for AP portable
 technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal
 limits aside from noting mildly prominent central pulmonary vascularity as
 well as tortuosity of the descending aorta.  Opacification of the left
 costophrenic sulcus may be seen with a pleural effusion.  There are mildly
 prominent indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting very mild congestion.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 Opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus, suspected to reflect a pleural
 effusion, likely small to moderate in size.
