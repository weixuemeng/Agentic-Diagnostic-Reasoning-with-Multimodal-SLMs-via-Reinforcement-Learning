                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  There has been interval enlargement of the right
 hilum, with apparent surrounding architectural distortion.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists, with a tortuous and calcified aorta.  Continued
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests small pleural effusion or
 scarring.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New right hilar enlargement could represent underlying lymphadenopathy,
 mass, or enlarged pulmonary artery.  Recommend chest CT when clinically
 appropriate.
 
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 3.  Chronic left pleural effusion versus scarring.
