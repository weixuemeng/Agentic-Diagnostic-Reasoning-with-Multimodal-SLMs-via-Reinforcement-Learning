                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea on exertion and leg swelling.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is similar moderate
 unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is similar blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
 probably chronic, although perhaps reflecting scarring or a very small
 loculated pleural effusion.  Patchy posterior basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis.  Interstitial opacification is quite mild but could be seen with
 slight congestion.  Mild degenerative changes are noted throughout the
 thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight interstitial abnormality suggesting mild interstitial
 congestion or fluid overload.
