                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for infiltrate or CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  ___ ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Stable irregularity of the left
 costophrenic angle is unchanged and correlates with mild pleural thickening
 and scarring.  Fullness in the right hilum is stable and represents
 superimposition of the pulmonary artery and veins.  The cardiac silhouette is
 stably enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Right hilar fullness is better evaluated on the recent CTs.
