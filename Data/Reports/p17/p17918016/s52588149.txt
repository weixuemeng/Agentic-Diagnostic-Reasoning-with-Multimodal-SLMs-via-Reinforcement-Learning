                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with gradual onset dyspnea, history of congestive
 heart failure, weight gain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph and chest CT___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous. 
 Mediastinal contour is similar.  Enlargement of the right hilum is unchanged,
 compatible with underlying dilatation of the right pulmonary artery. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle is compatible with chronic pleural thickening.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  There are moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Chronic enlargement of the right pulmonary
 artery compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Chronic left basal
 lateral pleural thickening.
