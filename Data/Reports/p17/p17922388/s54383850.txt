                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of systemic sclerosis and interstitial lung disease, now
 with diminished breath sounds over the left lung base.  Evaluate for effusions
 or infiltrates.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and a HRCT
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared with the prior exam dated ___, there has been minimal
 interval change.  Redemonstrated are low lung volumes and diffuse, bilateral
 reticular opacities consistent with the patient's known pulmonary fibrotic
 disease.  There has been no significant interval progression in the patient's
 parenchymal findings.  There are no acute findings of focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly
 is noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2. Stable, diffuse, bilateral reticular opacities consistent with the
 patient's known interstitial lung disease.
