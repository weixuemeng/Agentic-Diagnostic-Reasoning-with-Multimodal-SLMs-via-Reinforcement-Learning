 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:16 PM
  Lungs are low in volume which limits assessment and gives the appearance of
  bronchovascular crowding. Within this limitation, the presence of mild edema
  is difficult to determine. 
  
  LLL/retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis given low lung volumes, however
  accompanying trace effusion cannot be excluded. For more complete evaluation,
  2 view chest radiograph with full inspiration is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:39 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman, new onset of dyspnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are much lower, and therefore, bibasilar opacification can be
 attributed to atelectasis, without excluding pneumonia.  Low lung volumes
 exaggerate heart size and contribute to increased caliber in the upper lung
 vasculature and mediastinal veins, but there is no pulmonary edema or large
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
