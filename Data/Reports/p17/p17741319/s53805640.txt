                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post placement of left-sided
 chest tube and intubation, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  In addition, the patient tilts several degrees towards
 the right.  The patient is intubated and ETT identified and seen to terminate
 in the trachea some 3 cm above the level of the carina.  The area is overlying
 by a row of circular metallic suture wires indicating a previously performed
 sternotomy.  There are additional multiple surgical clips in the superior
 mediastinal area indicating previous surgery.  Detail cannot be evaluated on
 this single chest view examination.  One can, however, identify a left-sided
 chest tube seen to terminate in the left apical area and there is no evidence
 of pneumothorax on either side.  Lobular-shaped cardiac enlargement is noted
 and apparently metallic orthopedic hardware overlying the upper lumbar area
 suggestive of previous stabilizing device placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left-sided chest tube in place without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 ETT terminating 3 cm above the carina.
