                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:53
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post L1 fracture after a fall, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 10:37.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film, ___ at 3:53 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  There are likely bilateral
 layering effusions.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis or
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is cephalization of the
 vasculature which could be positional, but does raise concern for pulmonary
 venous hypertension.  No overt pulmonary edema is evident.  Spinal rods
 overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine, obscuring detail.  There
 has been a median sternotomy for CABG.
