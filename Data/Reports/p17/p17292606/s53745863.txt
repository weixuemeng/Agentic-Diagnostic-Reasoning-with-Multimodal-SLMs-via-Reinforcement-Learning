                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fever, immunosuppressed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 subtle areas of slightly increased opacity scattered bilaterally, which may be
 due to overlapping structures.  However, given patient's history, underlying
 ground-glass opacities and pulmonary infection are difficult to exclude.  No
 lobar consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle areas of small patchy opacity bilaterally, most likely
 relate to overlapping structures as these seem to be located in the region of
 the ribs.  However, underlying ground-glass opacity and infectious process are
 not excluded.  Subtle patchy left base opacity is stable as compared to
 ___.
