                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 patient's known mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right hilar mass and right lower
 lung consolidation/mass are better demonstrated on prior chest CT from
 ___.  Since the prior study, there may be subtle increase in right
 perihilar opacity with the increased interstitial markings likely representing
 lymphangitic spread of disease.  Subtle lateral left basilar opacity may be
 due to atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly
 stable.  The gastric fundus is distended with air.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible subtle increase in right perihilar opacities as well as
 increased conspicuity of increased interstitial markings on the right
 representing lymphangitic spread of disease.
