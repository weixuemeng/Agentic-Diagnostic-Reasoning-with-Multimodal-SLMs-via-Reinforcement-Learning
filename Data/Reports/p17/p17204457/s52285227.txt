 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There has

 The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  Left basilar opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumonia. The azygos vein is distended with
 fullness in the perihilar regions in the setting of moderate cardiomegaly,
 suggesting heart failure, similar to prior.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. Chronic heart failure with chronic moderate
 cardiomegaly.
