                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with COPD exacerbation, left basal ganglia stroke,
 followup pulmonary opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 5.7 cm above the carina.  Right jugular line is in upper SVC. 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has slightly increased since previous exam. 
 The increase in bibasilar opacities could reflect dependent edema or
 atelectasis.  Aspiration cannot be totally excluded in appropriate clinical
 setting.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  There
 is no pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Increase in bibasilar
 opacities could reflect dependent edema or atelectasis.  Aspiration cannot be
 excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
