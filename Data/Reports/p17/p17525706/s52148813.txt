                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Relative
 linear opacity at the left lung base may relate to atelectasis, although
 underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  There are low lung volumes and there is
 mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Perihilar peribronchial thickening
 is again seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes with mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 2.  Relative linear somewhat patchy opacity at the left lung base could relate
 to atelectasis, although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 3.  Persistent peribronchial thickening stable to slightly increased given
 differences in inspiration.
