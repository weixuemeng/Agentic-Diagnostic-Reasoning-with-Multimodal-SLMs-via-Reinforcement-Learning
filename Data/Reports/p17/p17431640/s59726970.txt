                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with EKOS catheter  // evaluate for placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Targeted review of chest CT from ___
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Opacity at the right lung apex is new compared with the ___ radiograph
 and in keeping with findings on the ___ CT scan.
 Allowing for differences in modalities, it may have progressed compared with
 the with yesterday's CT scan.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left base,
 similar to the prior film.  New linear atelectasis in the left mid-zone. 
 Lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  No CHF or effusion detected.
 
 There is a new right-sided IJ sheath in place in catheter entered follows the
 expected course of a Swan-Ganz catheter, with multiple radiopaque segments. 
 This presumably represents the EKOS catheter.  The tip overlies the proximal
 right pulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity at the right lung apex new compared with ___ radiographs and possibly
 progressed compared with ___ CT.  Although non-specific in appearance, given
 its peripheral location, it may very well represent a pulmonary infarct to
 patient's known thrombus.
 
 Minimal atelectasis left base.
 
 Right IJ line which is thought to represent EKOS catheter, with tip overlying
 proximal right pulmonary artery.
