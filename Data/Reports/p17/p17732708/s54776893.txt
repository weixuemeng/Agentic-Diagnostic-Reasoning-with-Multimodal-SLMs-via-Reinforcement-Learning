                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:01 A.M. ON ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after cholecystectomy.  Now with fever.  Possible
 pulmonary process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, there has been greater elevation of the right lung
 base relative to the left and there is new possible posterior mediastinal
 bulge projecting lateral to the descending thoracic aorta.  Both of these
 findings raise concern for fluid accumulation in the abdomen extending into
 the chest.  It is entirely possible that both of these findings are artifacts
 of suboptimal positioning and inspiration.  Therefore, I would strongly
 request that if the patient can tolerate conventional chest radiographs that
 these be obtained.
 
 Relative increase in caliber of the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
 vasculature reflect volume overload.  Aside from mild atelectasis at the base,
 the left lung is clear.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged to discuss these findings.
