                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with MS, hypoxia  // ?acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  A more focal
 consolidation at the base of the right lung could reflect an area of infection
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  No pleural effusions are seen.  There is
 no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.
 More focal consolidation at the base of the right lung may reflect an area of
 infection though is likely related to pulmonary edema.
