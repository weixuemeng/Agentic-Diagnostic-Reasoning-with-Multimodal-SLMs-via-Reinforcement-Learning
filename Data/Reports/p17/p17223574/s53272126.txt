 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:59 PM
  Very low lung volumes,  exaggerating heart and mediastinal contours and
  pulmonary vasculature and therefore limiting evaluation. Bibasilar
  atelectasis is present; further evaluation of the lung bases is limited on
  this study. There may be a small left pleural effusion. A staple projects over
  the right lower lung field; exact location is indeterminate on this single
  view. Endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 5-cm above the carina.
  Esophageal catheter position is difficult to determine as the distal portion
  is not well seen on any image.  Discussed with ___ by phone at 6:47
  p.m. on ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Desaturation, intubation, confirmation of endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has been intubated.
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina.  The patient
 has also received a nasogastric tube, the course of the tube can be followed
 through the upper and mid third of the esophagus but is not visible more
 peripherally than that.  Decreased lung volumes and increased diameter of the
 pulmonary vasculature, combined with blunting of the left costophrenic sinus,
 potentially reflecting moderate pulmonary edema and a small pleural effusion. 
 In addition atelectases are seen at both lung bases.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
 No evidence of pneumonia.
