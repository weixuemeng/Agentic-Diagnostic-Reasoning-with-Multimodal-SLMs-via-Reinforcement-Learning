                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath and CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting small airway obstruction or emphysema, but
 clear of any focal abnormality.  Cardiac silhouette size is exaggerated by
 narrow AP diameter, though there is probably still some cardiomegaly. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no edema or pleural effusion.
