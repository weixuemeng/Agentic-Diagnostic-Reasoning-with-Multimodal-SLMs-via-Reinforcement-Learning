                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided, demonstrating
 hyperinflated lungs with subtle upper lobe lucency, which could reflect
 underlying emphysema.  No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Two discrete tiny
 nodular densities projecting over the left perihilar region likely represent
 en face vessels.  Bony structures are intact.  A focal eventration of the left
 hemidiaphragm is seen on the lateral view posteriorly at the left lung base.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable COPD without superimposed pneumonia.
