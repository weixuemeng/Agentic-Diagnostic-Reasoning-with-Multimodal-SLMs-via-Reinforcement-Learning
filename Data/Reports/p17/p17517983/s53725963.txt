                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  DKA. Opacity in the left chest on prior study was obscured by EKG
 lead.  Repeat evaluation with removal of EKG leads.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with prior examination, there has been removal of the
 EKG leads and the associated ellipsoid density in the left upper chest does
 not persist and was associated with the lead itself.  There is otherwise no
 change compared to prior evaluation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal chest radiograph.  Previously noted density was part of an
 EKG lead.
