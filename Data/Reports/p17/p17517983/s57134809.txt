                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis, DKA, chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a small well defined rectangular
 opacity lateral to the EKG lead overlying the left upper chest wall, which is
 likely associated with the EKG lead. There is no other focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.  Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small well demarcated focal opacity adjacent to an EKG lead along
 the left upper chest wall which is likely associated with the lead. However, 
 a small focus of pneumonia cannot be excluded. Removal of the lead and repeat
 chest radiograph is recommended to document resolution of this opacity.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ this recommendation with the clinical team via telephone
