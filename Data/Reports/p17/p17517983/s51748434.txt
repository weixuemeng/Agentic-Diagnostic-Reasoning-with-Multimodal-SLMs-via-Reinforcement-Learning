                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain.  Additional history of end-stage
 renal disease per patient's prior radiology report.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  When compared to prior,
 there appears to be slight interval progression of the pulmonary edema with
 more confluent opacities at the bases.  Prominent extrapleural density seen on
 the right laterally suspicious for a small effusion.  There is no definite
 left pleural effusion.  Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval progression of the bilateral opacities most compatible
 with pulmonary edema.  Please note that superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
