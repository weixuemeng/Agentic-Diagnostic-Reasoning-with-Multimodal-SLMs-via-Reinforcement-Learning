                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  CVL placement, assess position.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided demonstrating a new
 right IJ central venous catheter in place with its tip in the mid SVC region. 
 The heart is stable in size, mildly enlarged.  Biateral lower lung
 consolidation seen on prior radiograph appears significantly improved with
 minimal residual streaky opacities which could represent a component of
 scarring.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
