                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged and within normal limits.  Bibasilar interstitial opacities have
 minimally improved compared to the previous exam but persist.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions have also nearly resolved.  No new focal consolidation is
 present and there is no pneumothorax.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval improvement in bibasilar interstitial opacities likely
 reflecting mild pulmonary edema with near resolution of small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
