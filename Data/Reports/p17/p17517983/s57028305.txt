                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with altered mental status, here to evaluate
 for pulmonary abnormality.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation of the chest is limited due to portable technique and rotation of
 the patient. Within this limitation, there is a left pectoral Port-A-Cath with
 the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is
 top normal in size. The aortic contours are prominent likely due to patient
 rotation. Increased pulmonary interstitial markings suggest minimal pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Trace pleural fluid is seen. There is no focal
 consolidation. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion and trace pleural fluid.
