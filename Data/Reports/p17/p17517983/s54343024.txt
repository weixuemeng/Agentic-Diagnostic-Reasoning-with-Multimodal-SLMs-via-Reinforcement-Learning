                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the prior exam, there has been marked interval increase in
 bilateral opacities with persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and
 cardiomegaly.  These opacities are symmetric with peribronchial cuffing and
 few Kerley B lines, suggestive of edema  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is detected.  Lung volumes are slightly low.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased bilateral pulmonary opacities in the setting of pulmonary vascular
 congestion and cardiomegaly.  The appearance is most consistent with edema,
 but clinical correlation is recommended for symptoms of infection. Follow up
 radiograph is recommended after diuresis or dialysis to assess response.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by ___
 ___ by phone at 6:48 a.m. on ___ at the time of initial review of the
 study.
