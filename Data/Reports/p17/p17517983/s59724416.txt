                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increase in bilateral perihilar patchy opacities, which
 could be due to pulmonary edema; however, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 multifocal infection could be present.  No large pleural effusion is seen, but
 trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increase in patchy perihilar opacities could be due to worsening
 pulmonary edema versus multifocal infection depending on the clinical
 scenario.
