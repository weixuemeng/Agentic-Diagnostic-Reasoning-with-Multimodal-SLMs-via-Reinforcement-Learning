                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Immunodeficiency with cough x2 weeks and hypoxia, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  On the lateral view, an opacification
 overlies the lower thoracic spine, but is difficult to localize on the frontal
 projection.  Linear opacity near the left lung base likely represents
 atelectasis.  There is a tiny right pleural effusion.  Again noted is slight
 prominence of the central pulmonary arteries, which is unchanged from prior. 
 The heart size is normal.  Old right rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity seen overlying the spine may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  It is difficult to localize, as it is not
 conspicuous on the frontal view, but may be in the right lower lung as seen on
 previous radiographs.
