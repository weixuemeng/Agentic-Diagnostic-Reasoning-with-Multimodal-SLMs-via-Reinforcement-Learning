                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HFrEF, CAD, and Afib who presents with Afib
 with RVR, shortness of breath, and neck tightness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Mild cardiomegaly is re-
 demonstrated.  Widening of the superior mediastinum is due to underlying
 lymphadenopathy, better appreciated on the prior CT.  Previous pattern of mild
 pulmonary edema has improved.  Large amount of fluid remains loculated in the
 minor fissure.  Moderate size left and right pleural effusions are re-
 demonstrated, not substantially changed in the interval.  Bibasilar patchy
 airspace opacities likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in previous pattern of mild pulmonary edema. Moderate
 size bilateral pleural effusions with a large amount of fluid loculated in the
 right minor fissure.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, likely compressive
 atelectasis.
