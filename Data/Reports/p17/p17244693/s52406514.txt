                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and chest CT studies dated ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 There is a  persistent loculated pleural effusion along the minor fissure on
 the right, but decreased even since the recent chest CT, comparing to scout
 views from that study.  A loculated basilar and lateral pleural effusion,
 however, is probably not substantially changed since the recent prior CT, with
 corresponding atelectasis.  It is not possible to exclude a persistent small
 left-sided pleural effusion that may be obscured, but none is clearly visible.
 The left base appears similar to the prior scout view.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is similar slight
 rightward convex curvature centered along the lower thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decrease in loculated pleural effusion along the right major
 fissure with no other definite change.  No definite evidence of superimposed
 acute process.
