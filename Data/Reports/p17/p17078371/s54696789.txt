                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are poorly expanded, accounting for some bronchovascular
 crowding.  Minimal interstitial prominence is unchanged likely indicative of
 mild esema, as on prior.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips
 are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild interstitial edema.
