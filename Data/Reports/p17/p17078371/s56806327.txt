                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis and HCC status post RFA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema is present.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unremarkable.  Minimal free air under the right hemidiaphragm is
 consistent with post-RF ablation and these changes are better appreciated on
 recent CT interventional study dated ___.  Minimal bibasilar
 opacities reflect consolidation and/or atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Free air in
 the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with recent RF ablation.
