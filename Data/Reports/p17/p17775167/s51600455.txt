                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with wheezes and crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with underlying obstructive
 lung disease.  There is predominantly streaky linear opacity laterally in the
 left upper lung likely in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe when
 corroborated with the lateral view.  Ill-defined opacities are seen in the
 right suprahilar region as well.  No superimposed edema is noted.  The
 mediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits
 for size.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  The visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined densities laterally in both upper lungs.  No
 comparisons to assess for chronicity of these findings.  If acute they could
 represent early multifocal pneumonia.  Conceivably however these could
 represent scarring which can be confirmed with prior radiographs.
