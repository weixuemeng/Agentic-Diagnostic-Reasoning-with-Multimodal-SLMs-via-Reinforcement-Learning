                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with COPD.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 In comparison to prior study, ill-defined opacities are again seen projecting
 over the right upper lobe and left upper lobe laterally.  The lung bases
 remain clear.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms suggesting underlying COPD.  There is no effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Little change in ill-defined bilateral upper lobe opacities compared to one
 day prior.  The chronicity of these remains indeterminate.  Early pneumonia
 could be considered in the proper clinical setting, though this could
 represent chronic scarring.  Comparison with more remote imaging is
 recommended.
 
 Hyperinflation compatible with known COPD.
