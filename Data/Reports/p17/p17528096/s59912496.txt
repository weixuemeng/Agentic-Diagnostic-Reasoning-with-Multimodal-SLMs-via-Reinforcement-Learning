                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted within the
 left lung base with associated small left pleural effusion.  Minimal
 atelectasis is noted in the right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  Lung
 hyperinflation persists.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated. 
 There are mild to moderate degenerative changes seen within the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pleural effusion and associated left basilar patchy opacity may
 reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
