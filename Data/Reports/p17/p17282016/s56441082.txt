                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lateral view is limited secondary to
 patient's arm being down.  There is no overt interstitial edema or pleural
 effusions.  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The right hilum may
 be full and there is a dilated or very tortuous ascending aorta.  No definite
 consolidation is evident, though the right infrahilar region is obscured.  No
 large pleural effusion is evident.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right hilar fullness. Possibly dilated ascending aorta
 2.  No definite consolidation, though the right infrahilar region is obscured.
 3.  No pulmonary edema
