                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart is enlarged. An ET tube terminates 5.8 cm
 above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  The lung
 volumes are markedly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.  There is a left retrocardiac
 opacity likely representing atelectasis, although an underlying consolidation
 cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  ET tube terminating 5.8 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube terminating
 within the stomach.
 2.  Left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis in the setting of very low
 lung volumes.
