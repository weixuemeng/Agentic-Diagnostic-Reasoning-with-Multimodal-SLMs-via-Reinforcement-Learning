                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 7:24.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left lung nodule status post resection, assess
 for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 12:29.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 7:24 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left chest tube remains in place.  Left sixth posterior lateral displaced rib
 fracture.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to
 detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright technique.  There is a
 small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall soft
 tissues.  There is improved aeration of the right base, although increasing
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  The vasculature is somewhat prominent, but no overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable
 status post median sternotomy.
