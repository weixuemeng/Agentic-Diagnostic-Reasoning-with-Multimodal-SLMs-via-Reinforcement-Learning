 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exams, most recent of which dates ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and hypoxia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Low lung volumes
 limit the evaluation, though allowing for this, there is no definite evidence
 for focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears stable with borderline cardiomegaly noted.  Bony structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
