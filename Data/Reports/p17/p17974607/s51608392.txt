 r/o infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and multiple prior radiographs
 dating back to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, possibly on the basis of restrictive lung disease.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Nonspecific reticular interstitial
 opacities appear unchanged from the prior radiograph but have probably
 worsened since ___.  No focal areas of consolidation are present to suggest
 the presence of pneumonia. There are no pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.  Nonspecific interstitial lung disease,
 which could be more fully characterized by high-resolution chest CT if
 warranted clinically.
