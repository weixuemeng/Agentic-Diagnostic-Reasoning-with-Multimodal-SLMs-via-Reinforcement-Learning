                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes limiting assessment.  Given this, increased interstitial
 markings are again seen including in the right upper lobe where there was
 previously pneumonia.  Findings could be due to infection and/or mild
 interstitial edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given differences in inspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings
 and limit assessment.  Increased markings diffusely bilaterally could in part
 be due to low lung volumes and AP technique; however, infection or
 interstitial edema is not excluded.  More focal opacity in the right upper to
 mid lung may be due to underlying pneumonia.
