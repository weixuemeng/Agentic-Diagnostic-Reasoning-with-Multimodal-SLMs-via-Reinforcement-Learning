                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pain in the right chest wall and distal forearm after trauma. 
 Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of rib fracture. 
 Of note, this study is suboptimal for the assessment of rib abnormalities.  If
 there is further concern, dedicated rib views should be obtained.
