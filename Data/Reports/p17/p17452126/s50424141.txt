                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Febrile, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs were acquired of the chest.  The left
 lung base is difficult to assess secondary to patient body habitus, although
 hazy opacification overlying the left mid-to-lower lung is not significantly
 changed compared to the prior study from ___.  There is mild
 right basilar atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is not significantly changed.  The thoracic aorta is ectatic, not
 significantly changed in caliber compared to the prior study from ___.  Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged.  Wedging of multiple
 thoracic vertebral bodies is not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite acute intrathoracic process.  The left lung base is difficult
 to assess, but stable compared to the prior study.
 
 2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly and ectasia of the thoracic aorta.
