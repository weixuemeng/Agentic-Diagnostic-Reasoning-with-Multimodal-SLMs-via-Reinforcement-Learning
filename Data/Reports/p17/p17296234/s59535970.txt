                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath with multiple nodules on C2 and lingular mass.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  There is no significant change in the appearance of the
 heart and lungs.  Large lingular mass persists.  Diffuse prominence of
 interstitial markings suggests chronic pulmonary disease, though the
 possibility of patchy infectious processes or diffuse metastases as suggested
 on CT would have to be considered.
