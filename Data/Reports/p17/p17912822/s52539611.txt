                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:40 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with TBI, intubated, rule out pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:04 a.m.
 
 A semisupine chest film ___ at 4:40 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line, feeding tube and endotracheal tube appear
 unchanged in position.  Lung volumes are slightly lower on the current
 examination.  Persistent heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base has
 likely not significantly changed, but may reflect an area of aspiration or
 early infection.  Followup imaging may be helpful.  There is persistent
 retrocardiac opacity as well, which could reflect an area of atelectasis or
 additional site of aspiration/pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax.
