 no appreciable pneumothorax except for a sliver of air in the minor fissure
 just above the pleural drainage tube.  The medial margin of the right scapula
 should not be mistaken for a pleural surface.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 has a normal postoperative appearance.  Midline and bilateral pleural drain
 still in place.  Swan-___ catheter ends in the proximal right pulmonary
 artery.
