 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, new pain in the left rib area, rule out rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both on the left and on the right, areas of lateral pleural
 thickening, adjacent to the ribs are seen.  In addition, on the left, at the
 lateral aspect of the seventh rib, a focal soft-tissue swelling is seen.  This
 could be an indirect sign for the presence of a rib fracture.  Rib fractures,
 however, should better be evaluated on dedicated rib series.  
 
 There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  Minimal atelectasis at both
 lung bases.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  Post-surgical material in the right humeral head.
