                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Back pain, to assess for rib fracture or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Multiple compression deformities in the spine as well as rib
 abnormalities are again consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. 
 Area of increasing opacification overlying the sternoclavicular region on the
 right is worrisome for metastatic or possibly infectious disease.  Otherwise,
 little change.
