                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. 
 Multifocal areas of linear atelectasis or scarring are again demonstrated in
 the mid and lower lungs, but there are no focal areas of consolidation to
 suggest the presence of pneumonia.  Bones are diffusely demineralized, and
 multilevel compression deformities are again visualized throughout the spine
 as well as numerous rib abnormalities that are likely related to history of
 myeloma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
