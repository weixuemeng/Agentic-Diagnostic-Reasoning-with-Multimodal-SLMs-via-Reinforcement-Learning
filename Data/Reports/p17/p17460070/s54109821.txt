                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multiple myeloma and weakness.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are very low, exaggerating cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 pulmonary vascular markings.  Linear density in the right lower lung field
 likely represents atelectasis.  The patient's chin obscures the medial
 portions of the lung apices.  On this limited study, no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Lower thoracic vertebra plana is chronic.  Right
 humeral head hardware is noted.  Diffuse bony mottling is likely secondary to
 myeloma. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Markedly low lung volumes, limiting evaluation, with right lung atelectasis.
