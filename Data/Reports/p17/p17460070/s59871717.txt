                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy left base opacity seen on the frontal view could be due to
 atelectasis/scarring, although a developing consolidation is not excluded.  No
 right-sided focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Apparent thickening/possible periosteal reaction along the
 lateral left rib, approximately at the level of the left seventh rib may be
 due to a healing fracture and/or underlying myelomatous lesion.  There is
 stable loss of height of the upper-to-mid thoracic vertebral body.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
