 mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation on
 the current examination.  Spinal hardware overlies the thoracic spine with
 some adjacent surgical skin ___ consistent with recent surgery.  Left
 internal jugular central line unchanged in position.  Catheter overlying the
 right mid to lower chest is unchanged.
