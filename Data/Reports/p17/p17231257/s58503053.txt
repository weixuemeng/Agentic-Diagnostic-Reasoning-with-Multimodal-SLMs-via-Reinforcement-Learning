                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post assault with headache and
 photophobia and left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for rib fractures
 near sixth to eighth ribs. 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are normal.  Both lungs are clear with no pleural effusion, focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  No definite rib fractures are identified;
 however, if there is continued clinical concern for rib fractures, then a
 dedicated rib series can be obtained.
