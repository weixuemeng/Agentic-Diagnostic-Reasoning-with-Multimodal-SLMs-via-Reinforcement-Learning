                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with SOB, fever  // eval for pleural effusion, PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  The cardiac silhouette is minimally enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly indistinct.  Vague opacity is
 seen at the left lung base, which may represent pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Increased interstitial markings in the bilateral lung bases
 are noted.  No definite pleural effusion is identified.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 There is multifocal osseous blastic disease limits evaluation of the lungs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 1.  Vague left basilar opacity, in the appropriate clinical context, may
 represent pneumonia.
 2.  Increased, bibasilar interstitial markings, of unclear etiology, possibly
 related to mild edema versus chronic interstitial lung disease.
 2.  Widespread, multifocal osteoblastic disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 If tolerable for the patient, PA and lateral views of the chest can be
 obtained for further evaluation.
