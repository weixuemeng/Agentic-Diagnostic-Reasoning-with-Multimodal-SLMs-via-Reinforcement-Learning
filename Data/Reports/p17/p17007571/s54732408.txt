                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with right-sided chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and multiple prior chest
 radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Multiple calcified granulomas are redemonstrated
 throughout both lungs, unchanged compared with prior exam. Linear opacity in
 the periphery of the right mid lung is unchanged from prior and likely
 represents thickening and scarring of the minor fissure seen on prior CT.
 There is no new focal opacity concerning for pneumonia. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. Prosthetic aortic valve is redemonstrated.  Prior right-sided
 central venous catheter is no longer seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
