 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and fever, please assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  There is residual
 subcutaneous emphysema along the left lateral chest wall, which is improved
 from prior exam.  There is bibasilar opacity which likely represents a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion, overall increased from prior exam. 
 The heart remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Retrocardiac density could also represent a hiatal
 hernia.  The bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased bibasilar opacity likely representing a combination of
 atelectasis and effusion, though pneumonia not entirely excluded.  Improving
 left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. Please refer to subsequent CTA chest
