 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:26 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild decrease in
 extent of the existing gas collections in the thoracic and cervical soft
 tissues.  A minimal sub-millimetric hyperlucent line along the aortopulmonary
 window could represent a small portion of the known pneumomediastinum.  There
 is no evidence of tension.  No other pathologic findings.
