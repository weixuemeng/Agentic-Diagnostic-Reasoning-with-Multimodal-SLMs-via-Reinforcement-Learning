                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new leukocytosis, c/f LLL infiltrate on
 portable CXR  // evaluation for infiltrate      evaluation for infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, though the
 pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits.  Retrocardiac
 opacification could merely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base.
