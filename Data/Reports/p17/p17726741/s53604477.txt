 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a radiopaque device projecting over the left shoulder.
 
 There is a linear opacity in the right lower lung, which likely represents
 atelectasis.  There is a more confluent opacity at the left lung base.  There
 is a small left pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No
 pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Confluent opacity at left lung base, which likely represents atelectasis, but
 coexisting pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
