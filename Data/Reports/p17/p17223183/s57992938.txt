                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intubation, please evaluate for aspiration or other
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable exam of the chest, two separate acquisitions.
 
 FINDINGS:  There were two separate acquisitions for this clip. The first
 acquisition demonstrates the ETT in the right mainstem bronchus. The
 subsequent image demonstrates interval retraction of the ETT, which now
 terminates approximately 2.7-cm above the carina. The diffuse regions of
 opacification in the left lung are persistent, which could be secondary to
 component of unresolved atelectasis, however an underlying infectious process
 is also suspected. Less extensive patchy consolidation ___ at the upper right
 lung. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is thoracic levosoliosis.
 Note is made of a lap band, which appears to be in appropriate position within
 the abdomen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. First acquisition demonstrates the ETT in the right main-stem bronchus,
 which was retracted by the second acquisition, and now terminates 2.7-cm above
 the carina.
 
 2.  Persistent diffuse regions of opacification in the left lung, which could
 have component of unresolved atelectasis, however a multifocal infectious
 process is suspected.
 
 3.  Additional opacity overlying the right upper lung suspicious for additonal
 site of pneumonia.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___, by Dr. ___ by telephone at
 4:___p on the day of the exam.
