                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with CHF, dementia, now febrile and
 hypoxic, is there a new pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison can be made with the next preceding
 transferred chest examination from ___.  Frontal view
 demonstrates status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical
 clips indicative of previous bypass surgery.  The heart shadow is markedly
 prominent to the left, getting in contact with the left lateral chest wall on
 the base.  The left-sided diaphragm contour is completely obliterated.  In the
 accessible lung field on the left side, the pulmonary vasculature shows marked
 perivascular haze similar as the entire right-sided lung demonstrates in the
 right hemithorax.  The impression is that the patient is markedly congested. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The findings were similar on the
 transferred chest examination the preceding day.
 
 It is observed that the patient has undergone a CT torso examination on
 ___.  The result of that examination should overcome the
 limitations of the portable chest examination in a patient without history.
