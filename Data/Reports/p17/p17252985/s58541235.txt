                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and chills, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  There are somewhat ill-defined areas of possible
 increased opacification at the bases.  Although this could merely reflect
 atelectatic change, in view of the clinical history, superimposed pneumonia
 (especially on the left) should be considered.
