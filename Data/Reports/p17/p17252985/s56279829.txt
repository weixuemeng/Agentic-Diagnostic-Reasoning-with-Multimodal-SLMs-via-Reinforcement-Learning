                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Opacity within the lingula and left
 lower lobe obscures the left heart border.  The right lung is clear without
 focal opacity.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Evaluation of
 the cardiac contours is limited due to the overlying opacity.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal. There is no free air beneath the hemidiaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity within the lingula and left lower lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views for improved assessment.
