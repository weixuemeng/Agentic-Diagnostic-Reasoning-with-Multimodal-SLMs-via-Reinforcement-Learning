                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough productive of white sputum.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Bullous emphysematous changes are most severe within the lung apices. 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, right more than left, likely reflect atelectasis. 
 Blunting of the right costophrenic angle posteriorly is suggestive of a small
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Compression fractures of
 T12 and L1 with evidence of prior kyphoplasty of L1 is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities, most likely reflective of
 atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.  Small right pleural
 effusion.  Bullous emphysema.
