                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with confusion.  Question infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 Lower lung volumes are seen on the current exam.  There is, however, new right
 basilar opacity likely within the lower lobe.  Chronic underlying lung disease
 seen with bullous change and relative lucency of the apices.  There is no
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft
 tissue structures, noting compression deformity and vertebroplasty changes are
 not as well seen on the current exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New right basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis given
 lower lung volumes, however, pneumonia is also possible.  Given patient's
 history, a repeat exam is suggested either after treatment or with better
 inspiratory effort on the frontal view.
