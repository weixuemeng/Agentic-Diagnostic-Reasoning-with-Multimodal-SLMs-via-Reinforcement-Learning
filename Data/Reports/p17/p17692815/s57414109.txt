                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible carotid occlusion, to assess for lung lesion.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs with
 flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. 
 Cardiac silhouette is at upper limits of normal in size.  Coarseness of
 interstitial markings could reflect chronic lung disease, some elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion. There is mild loss
 of height of a lower thoracic vertebral body.
