                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory fail  // Eval OGT position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP semi-upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. 
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC.  The enteric tube is below the
 diaphragm however the tip is not visualized.  An esophageal stent is again
 noted.
 
 Extensive interval development of asymmetric opacification of the right mid to
 lower lung and to a lesser extent patchy opacification of the left lower lung
 could represent infectious or aspiration pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  A small right pleural effusion is possible.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval extensive asymmetrical opacification of the right mid to lower lung
 and heterogeneous opacities in the left lower lung, raise concern for
 infectious or aspiration pneumonia.
