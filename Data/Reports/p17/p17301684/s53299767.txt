                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal cancer and new oxygen
 requirement.  // Evaluate for signs of aspiration or other cause of new oxygen
 requirement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Port-A-Cath tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are very low. 
 Increased perihilar and bibasilar opacities likely relate to vascular crowding
 as a result of low volumes.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural
 effusion.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  An esophageal stent is
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacification at the right base probably relates to atelectasis, but
 aspiration may have a similar appearance.
