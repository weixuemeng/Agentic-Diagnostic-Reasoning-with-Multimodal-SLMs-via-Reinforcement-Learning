 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:18 AM
  
  
  Endotracheal tube is 6.6 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube extends to at
  least the body of the stomach.
  
  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new.  Left retrocardiac opacity appears
  more dense compared to the prior study, and may reflect worsening atelectasis,
  but underlying pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate
  clinical setting.  No sizable effusion.  Heart size remains enlarged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with r/o PNA  // PNA? possible lung donation,
 NEOB
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, an endotracheal tube has been
 advanced and still has a relatively proximal location, now approximately 7.1
 cm above the carina.  This could be advanced a few cm for standard
 positioning.  Lower lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Even accounting for this factor, mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion is new.  Worsening bibasilar opacities probably reflect
 atelectasis although aspiration and developing infection are additional
 considerations.  Possible new small right pleural effusion, and no visible
 pneumothorax.
