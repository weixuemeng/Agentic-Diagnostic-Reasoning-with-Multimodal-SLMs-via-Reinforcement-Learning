                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent kidney failure, hypercalcemia and hypothermia.
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  Widened mediastinum is due to lymphadenopathy ,
 better seen on prior CT from ___ and engorgement of the vessels.  This
 is unchanged from prior.  Large right pleural effusion, small left pleural
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis, larger on the right side are stable.  Mild
 vascular congestion has improved.  There are no new lung abnormalities.
