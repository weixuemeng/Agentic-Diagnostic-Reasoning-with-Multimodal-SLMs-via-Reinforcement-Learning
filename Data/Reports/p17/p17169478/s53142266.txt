                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Heart failure with increasing SOB, chronic renal failure.
 
 CHEST AP SUPINE 
 
 There has been no change since the prior chest x-ray.  Opacification of the
 right chest is present, which probably represents layering effusion in the
 supine position.  Left effusion is also probably present though not as large. 
 Underlying lung lesions are unlikely.
