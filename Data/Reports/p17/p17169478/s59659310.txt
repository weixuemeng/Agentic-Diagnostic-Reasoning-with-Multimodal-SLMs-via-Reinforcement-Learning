                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest supine AP portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute CHF from outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine AP portable views of the chest are obtained.  There has been
 interval removal of the right-sided PICC.  Opacity projecting over the right
 lung may be due to a layering pleural effusion, although underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.  The left lung is grossly clear with
 possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement centrally.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.
