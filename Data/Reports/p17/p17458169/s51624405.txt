                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The lungs are again
 hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  Subtle right upper lobe scarring is again
 seen.  Evidence of right upper lobe blebs/bulla again seen.  Ovoid calcified
 opacity best seen on the lateral view, projecting retrocardiac at the inferior
 chest measuring 1.4 cm, may represent a calcified granuloma or node, similar
 to prior.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  The aorta is
 somewhat tortuous.  No focal consolidation or pleural effusion, or evidence of
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 COPD.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
