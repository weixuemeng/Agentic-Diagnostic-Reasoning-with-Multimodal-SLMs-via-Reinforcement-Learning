 underlying left base consolidation is difficult to exclude radiographically. 
 The lateral view is less than optimal due the patient's overlying arm.  No
 right pleural effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Multiple left-sided rib fractures
 were better seen on preceding CT.
