  The NG tube is in the stomach although the proximal weighted portion is near
  the GE junction and could be advanced 5-6 cm to place the entire portion in
  the stomach if desired.  Bibasilar interstitial opacities persist particularly
  at the bases and could reflect atelectasis.  There is no cardiomegaly.  There
  is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The side port is at the GE junction and should
 be advanced at least 6 cm for more standard position.  Cardiac size is normal.
 Bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax
 or pleural effusion.
