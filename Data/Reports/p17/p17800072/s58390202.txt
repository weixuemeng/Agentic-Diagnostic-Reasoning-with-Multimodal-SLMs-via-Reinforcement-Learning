                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Increased
 heterogenous opacity in the left lower lobe may represent infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The remainder of the lungs are clear aside from
 mild right basilar atelectasis.  Trace pleural effusions are difficult to
 exclude bilaterally, with blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles on the
 lateral view.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogenous left lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
