 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with emphysema.

 from ___.  There are no new opacities.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable
 with stable tortuosity of the aorta and with atherosclerotic calcifications. 
 Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities are again noted, right greater than left, and
 suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
