  Compared with the chest radiograph of 2 days prior, there has been slight

  aeration, particularly in the right lung.  Lung volumes continue to be low. 
  No pneumothorax or new focal consolidation is identified.  The known right IJ
  catheter terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypotension, tachycardia, elevated lactate
 2.6.  // New focal findings?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph of ___, bilateral asymmetrically
 distributed heterogeneous opacities have substantially improved, possibly due
 to asymmetrical edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are again
 demonstrated, and note is made of moderate gastric distension in the imaged
 portion of the upper abdomen.
