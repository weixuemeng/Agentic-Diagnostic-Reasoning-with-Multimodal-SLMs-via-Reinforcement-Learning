                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cirrhosis, lower extremity edema, ascites, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Clips in the right
 and left neck are noted.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen.  In
 addition, a retrocardiac opacity is seen which most likely reflects  the
 presence of a hiatal hernia.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  No signs of CHF.  Calcific
 densities project over the upper lungs which likely represent vascular
 calcifications.  The bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity likely
 represents a hiatal hernia.  No signs of CHF or pneumonia.
