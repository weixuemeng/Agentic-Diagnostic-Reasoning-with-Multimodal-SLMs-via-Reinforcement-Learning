 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis, evaluation for infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant

 artificial enlargement of the heart.  There is no evidence of acute changes
 such as pleural effusions, pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
 visualized.
