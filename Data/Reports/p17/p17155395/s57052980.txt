                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough for 24 hours, recent fall with possible
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are low. 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Linear bibasilar
 airspace opacities are in keeping with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion is demonstrated.  Mild loss of height of the
 T12 vertebral body is unchanged with mild degenerative changes within the
 imaged thoracic spine noted.  Minimal deformity of the right eighth lateral
 rib is suggestive of a nondisplaced fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
 otherwise demonstrated.
 2. Minimal deformity of the right eighth lateral rib suggestive of a
 nondisplaced fracture, and clinical correlation with site of tenderness is
 recommended.
