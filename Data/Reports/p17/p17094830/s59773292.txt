                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with nodular opacity on pre-op chest x-ray  //
 assess nodular opacity seen on pre-op chest x-ray
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are ill-defined bibasilar patchy opacities, which have progressed
 compared to the prior radiograph, and may represent atelectasis, however an
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The previously visualized nodule is
 not definitively seen on this examination.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Ill-defined bibasilar opacities, which are obscuring the previously visualized
 nodule, and may represent atelectasis or in underlying pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  If clinically indicated, a CT may help evaluate the
 previously visualized nodular opacity and differentiate atelectasis from an
 early developing pneumonia.
 
 NOTFICATIONS:   The impression and recommendation above was entered by Dr.
 ___ on ___ at 14:49 into the Department of Radiology
