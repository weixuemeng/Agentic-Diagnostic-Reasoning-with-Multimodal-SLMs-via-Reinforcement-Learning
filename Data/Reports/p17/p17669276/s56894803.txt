                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dry cough and intermittent shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:     
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is moderately enlarged. 
 Layering pleural effusions are present.  These are difficult to directly
 compare to the prior study, because of suspected differences in positioning,
 but the appearance is probably fairly similar.  Coinciding compressive
 atelectasis is likely.  Mild interstitial opacification suggests mild vascular
 congestion, new since the prior study.  Prior vertebroplasties have been
 performed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild interstitial pulmonary edema and persistent bilateral
 pleural effusions, probably at least moderate in size.
