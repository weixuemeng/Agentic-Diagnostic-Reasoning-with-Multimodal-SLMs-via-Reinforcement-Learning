                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old female with the recent aortic valve replacement, now
 presenting with increasing cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Recent chest radiograph from ___ and PA and lateral chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 AP SEMI-ERECT AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Evaluation is limited due to
 significant patient rotation to the right.  Median sternotomy wires appear
 intact.  Moderately severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appears
 grossly unchanged.  Evaluation of the mediastinum is limited due to the
 significant patient rotation.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The
 appearance is similar to recent portable radiograph from ___.  Blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles is chronic and are compatible with
 persistent small pleural effusions.  No confluent consolidation or
 pneumothorax is present.  Evidence of prior vertebroplasty in the mid thoracic
 spine is unchanged from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Limited examination due to poor patient positioning.
 2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is similar to recent prior examination
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Stable moderately severe cardiomegaly.
 4.  No confluent consolidation or pneumothorax.
