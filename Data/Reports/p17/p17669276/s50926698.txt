                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated which somewhat limits evaluation. The patient is status
 post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement.  Heart size is moderately
 enlarged but unchanged.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  There is mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, relatively unchanged.  At least small bilateral
 pleural effusions are present.  Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 compressive atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are
 noted in both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints with narrowed acromial
 humeral intervals suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.   There is
 evidence of prior vertebroplasty at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions, similar compared
 to the prior exam.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 compressive atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
