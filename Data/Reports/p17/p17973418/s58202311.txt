                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and new diffuse interstitial edema.  Additional patchy
 opacities in both lower lobes probably represent atelectasis in the setting of
 low lung volumes, and less likely aspiration or developing infection.  Small
 pleural effusions are present bilaterally, left greater than right, and
 diffuse haziness of the upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
