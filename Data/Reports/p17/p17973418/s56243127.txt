                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough, assess Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is in the upper-to-mid esophagus.  Increasing opacities in
 the right lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration.  Left lower opacities are
 unchanged.  Mild interstitial edema has minimally improved.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 4:20 p.m.
