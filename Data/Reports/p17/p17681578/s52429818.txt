  Right paratracheal opacity posterior to the trachea on the lateral view and
  appears to exert mass effect, with the trachea anterior in position, worrisome
  for underlying mass/ lymphadenopathy. . Recommend chest CT for further
  evaluation.
  
  Surgical clips are noted projecting over the upper mediastinum, to the left of
  midline. Correlate with prior surgical procedure.

 right paratracheal opacity with a posterior to the trachea on the lateral view
 and appearing to exert mass effect on the trachea, with the trachea anterior

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right paratracheal opacity posterior to the trachea on the lateral view and
 appears to exert mass effect, with the trachea anterior in position, worrisome
 for underlying mass/ lymphadenopathy.
 Surgical clips are noted projecting over the upper mediastinum, to the left of
 midline. Correlate with prior surgical procedure.  Recommend chest CT for
 further evaluation if underlying mediastinal enlargement/soft tissue has not
 already been evaluated.
