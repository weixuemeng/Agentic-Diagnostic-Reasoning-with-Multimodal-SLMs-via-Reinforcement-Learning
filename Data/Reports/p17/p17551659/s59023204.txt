                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Extensive changes of intrathoracic malignancy appear similar to the
 prior radiograph including circumferential right-sided pleural disease,
 mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, and apparent lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis in the right lung.  These findings have been characterized in
 greater detail on prior CTA of the chest of ___.  Worsening right
 middle and right lower lobe opacities may reflect a combination of atelectasis
 and infectious consolidation.  Within the left lung, ground-glass and
 reticular opacities have worsened since the recent radiograph, and most likely
 represent pulmonary edema.
