                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Interval assessment in a patient with a right pleural effusion
 status post right thoracentesis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed.  Compared
 to the most recent prior study, the volume of the left lung has improved and
 it is now clear.  Increased opacity in the right lower lung that tracks along
 the lateral pleural surface represents a small to moderate right pleural
 effusion that has been increasing compared to the studies performed after the
 right sided thoracentesis.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. 
 Normal heart size and a tortuous calcified arota are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increase small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.  
 2.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
