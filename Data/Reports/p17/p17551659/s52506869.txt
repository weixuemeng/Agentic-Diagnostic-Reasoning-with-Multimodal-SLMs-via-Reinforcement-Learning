                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Malignant right pleural effusion, status post thoracocentesis,
 questionable pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:25 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a
 right thoracocentesis.  The extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion
 has dramatically decreased.  Effusion is almost completely resolved only a
 minimal portion of effusion is seen in the lateral and basal areas of the
 right lower hemithorax.  The cranial fluid extension that was previously seen
 is unchanged.  There is no overt pneumothorax seen on today's image.  The
 appearance of the left lung is unchanged.  Minimal remnant atelectasis at the
 right lung bases.
