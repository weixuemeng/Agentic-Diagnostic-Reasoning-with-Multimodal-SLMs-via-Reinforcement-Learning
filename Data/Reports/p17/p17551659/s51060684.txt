                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath, decreased breath sounds on right.  Assess
 for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  No prior exams for
 comparison.  There is opacity obscuring the left mid and lower lung compatible
 with pneumonia with an associated pleural effusion.  The left lung is
 essentially clear.  No pneumothorax.  The heart size cannot be assessed due to
 silhouetting of the right heart border, limiting evaluation.  The mediastinal
 contour appears normal.  The bony structures appear intact with degenerative
 changes at the left shoulder partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity involving the left mid and lower lung which is concerning
 for pneumonia with associated effusion.  Followup to resolution advised.
