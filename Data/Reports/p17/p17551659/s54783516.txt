                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with malignant pleural effusion.  Evaluate pleural
 tube position.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The side hole of a new right
 pleural tube is positioned outside of the pleural cavity.  The tip of a second
 linear body immediately inferior to this pleural tube is not visualized. 
 Heterogeneous opacity overlying the right lung base is likely a combination of
 small effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  Indistinct left costophrenic angle
 and retrocardiac opacity is consistent with a small left pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly and cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Side-hole of new right pleural tube is positioned outside the pleural
 cavity. 
 
 2.  Re-accumulation of right pleural effusion, now small, with small left
 pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.  
 
 Findings were communicated via phone call by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 on ___ at ___ PM.
