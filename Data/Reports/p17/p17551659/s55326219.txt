                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of malignant effusions, worsening shortness of breath,
 evaluation for recurrence.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural
 thickening, likely caused by a combination of fluid and soft tissue material,
 has increased.  As a consequence, the ventilated parts of the right lung have
 decreased.  There are slightly increased interstitial markings on the right.
 
 The overall size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, the left lung is
 normal.  No left pleural effusion.
