                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with right pleural
 effusion, now with acute shortness of breast, atrial fibrillation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.  
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  There is re-demonstration
 of right pleural effusion, large, mostly layering but potentially in part
 loculated.  Left mediastinal shift is unchanged.  The reticular opacities
 primarily involving the left lower lung are re-demonstrated and might
 represent a combination of infectious process and pulmonary edema.  No
 worsening of the pulmonary edema is demonstrated but interval increase in
 right pleural effusion is suspected.
