                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stab wound to left chest and neck, status post left chest tube. 
 Evaluates for interval change in the left pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___, as well as CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral expiratory chest radiographs again demonstrate a left
 chest tube, which is in the fissure.  The small left apical pneumothorax is
 unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal contour remains normal, with persistent
 mediastinal air.  A left midlung opacity representing the known laceration is
 again seen.  Increased opacity of the lingula represents continued hemorrhage,
 as seen on recent CT.  A larger left posterior pleural fluid collection is
 concerning for increased hemothorax.  The right lung remains well expanded and
 clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged left apical pneumothorax, with the left chest tube in the
 fissure. 
 
 2.  Increased posterior left pleural fluid collection is concerning for
 increased hemothorax. 
 
 3.  Slightly increased lingular opacity may represent continued lingular
 hemorrhage, as seen on recent CT chest.
