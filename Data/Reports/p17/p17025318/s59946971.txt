                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after stab wound to the
 chest with left chest tube, now on waterseal.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The left apical pneumothorax is unchanged or minimally smaller.  The
 subcutaneous air is substantial and potentially slightly increased as compared
 to the prior study.  Slight improvement of the left basal aeration is noted. 
 No interval increase in small amount of left hemothorax is present.  Right
 lung is clear and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
