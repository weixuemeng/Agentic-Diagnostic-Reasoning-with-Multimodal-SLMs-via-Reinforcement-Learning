                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess size of lung lesions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 decrease in the right lower lung opacification medially.  Moderate residual
 persists.  The right upper to mid lung nodule has decreased in size. 
 Continued blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests pleural
 thickening, since there is no filling of the posterior costophrenic sulcus on
 the lateral view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased size and density of the previously described mass and
 nodule.
