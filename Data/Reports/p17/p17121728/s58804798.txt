                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with worsening cough and
 elevated white count.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___ in conjunction with CT torso from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal with a mildly tortuous aorta.  Fullness of the
 right hilum corresponds to right hilar lymphadenopathy on recent CT
 examination with compression of the right main stem bronchus.  A large right
 lung base mass with associated effusion is similar in appearance to prior CT
 examination.  Multiple left-sided nodules seen on previous CT have increased
 in size, particularly with the previously noted left lung base nodule
 increasing in size from approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in transverse diameter. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  A large right lung base mass similar in appearance to recent CT
 examination with interval growth of left-sided nodules.  Overall appearance is
 similar to that of the CT examination without evidence of concurrent
 pneumonia.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr.
 ___ at 1:30 p.m. on ___, at the time of initial review.
