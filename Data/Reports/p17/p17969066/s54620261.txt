                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina.  An orogastric
 courses into the stomach.  Pacer pad projects over the left lower chest in
 addition to other wires that are probably outside the patient.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the limitations of
 technique.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is slight
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures with patchy medial right basilar
 opacity suggesting atelectasis.  Otherwise the lungs appear clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacity with volume loss, most likely due to atelectasis
 although other etiologies such is aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia are not
 excluded by this examination.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful
 to reassess.
