                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with bilateral upper extremity
 paresthesias with extension of limbs, also swelling  concerning for thoracic
 outlet syndrome, evaluate for cervical ribs, long transverse cervical
 processes or rib/clavicular fracture calluses.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination of ___.  The heart size is well within
 normal limits.  No configurational abnormality is seen.  Unremarkable
 appearance of thoracic aorta.  Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No
 signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral
 and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures of the thorax are
 unremarkable.  Normal-appearing first ribs bilaterally and no evidence of
 cervical ribs.  No rib effusions.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic spine
 on the lateral view.  Remarkable on previous as well as the present
 examination are the very prominent soft tissue structures that surround the
 thoracic skeleton.  Obviously the patient is rather adipos.  The relatively
 small heart size matches this finding as heart size is more determined by lean
 body mass.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no cardiovascular pulmonary abnormalities,
 no obvious rib abnormalities that may indicate upper thoracic outlet syndrome.
