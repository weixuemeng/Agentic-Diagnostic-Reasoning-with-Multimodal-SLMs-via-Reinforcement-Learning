  1. Large left pleural effusion with significant complete collapse of the left
  lower lobe.
  2. Opacification at the lung bases as the result of atelectasis and effusion
  may obscure an underlying consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain  // acute process        pertinent
 history obtained from the___ medical record is that the patient is on
 dialysis for end-stage renal disease.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a large left pleural effusion with partial collapse of the left lower
 lobe.  Moderate atelectasis is also noted on the right and overall lung
 volumes are low.  Heart size is likely normal, although accentuated by the
 portable technique and low lung volumes.  There is no definite consolidation
 in the aerated portion of the lungs; however, a left lower lobe consolidation
 could be obscured by the atelectasis and effusion.  A vascular stent is seen
 extending across the anterior mediastinum.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Large left pleural effusion with partial collapse of the left lower lobe
 and patchy atelectasis at the right base in the setting of low lung volumes. 
 Pneumonia cannot be excluded.
