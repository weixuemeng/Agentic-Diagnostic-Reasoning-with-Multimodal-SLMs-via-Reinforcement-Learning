                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post VATS right upper lobectomy in
 ___, now with expectoration of clotted blood on ___, here to
 assess for new pulmonary pathology.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest imaging studies, the most recent of which is
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe wedge resection with
 multiple surgical clips above the right hilum.  There is expected
 post-surgical volume loss in the right hemithorax with rightward deviation of
 the mediastinum.  In the periphery of the pulmonary parenchyma both above and
 below the right minor fissure, there are new opacities which may represent
 local hemorrhage or infectious infiltrate.  There is a persistent loculated
 fluid collection in the right apex which is resolving compared to the prior
 study.  There is stable chronic pleural thickening in the left hemithorax.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiac silhouette is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Left-sided
 healed rib fractures are unchanged.  Scarring in the left lower lobe with
 tenting of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged from the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New peripheral opacities in the right lung above and below the
 right minor fissure may represent focal hemorrhage or local infectious
 infiltrates.  Followup short interval chest radiographs are recommended.  
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ pulmonology
 by phone at 4:30 p.m. on ___.
