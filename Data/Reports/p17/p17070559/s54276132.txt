                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post right upper lobectomy for nodule.
 
 STUDY:  Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA from ___ and PA and lateral chest
 radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  Clips in the right hilus are compatible with right
 partial lobectomy change.  Right-sided chest tube is also present.  There is
 no large pneumothorax on the right.  There does not appear to be diaphragmatic
 flattening.  Subtle rightward mediastinal shift is present, likely the effect
 of lobectomy.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no large pleural
 effusion.  Expected subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is present.
