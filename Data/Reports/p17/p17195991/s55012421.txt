 consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at
 the upper limits of normal. Surgical ___ and sutures noted in the upper
 abdomen.

 1.  Limited study demonstrates endotracheal tube in mid trachea.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary process noted.
 2.  Left internal jugular line is noted with the tip likely in the right
 atrium.
