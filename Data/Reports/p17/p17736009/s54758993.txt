                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, AF.  // ___ year old man with CHF, AF.  
 CHF AND AF R/O ABNORMALITY
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs are not available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is top-normal size, pulmonary vasculature is normal.  A 34 mm wide oval
 opacity projecting over the right first rib could be a region of sclerosis in
 the costo sternal process, but it could also be a small lung mass.  I would
 recommend evaluation with CT scanning.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is
 no pleural effusion or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to evaluate possible right upper lobe nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
