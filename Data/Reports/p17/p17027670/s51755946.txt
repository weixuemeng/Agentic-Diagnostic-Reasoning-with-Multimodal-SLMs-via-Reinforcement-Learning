                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HIV, with altered mental status and
 vomiting, just intubated for airway protection.  // please evaluate for
 evidence of aspiration, and for endotracheal tube location
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, the patient has been intubated
 with endotracheal tube in standard position.  Lung volumes are low.  Worsening
 bibasilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis, but aspiration is an
 additional consideration.  Mild to moderate gastric distension is new with
 indwelling nasogastric tube in place.
