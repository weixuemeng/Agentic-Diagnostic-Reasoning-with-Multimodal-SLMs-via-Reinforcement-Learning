 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, left hemidiaphragm is less
 distinct, probably due to a combination of a small left pleural effusion and
 adjacent minor atelectasis.  Left PICC remains malpositioned, coiling in the
 left axilla and terminating in the left subclavian vein.
