 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 12:18 PM
  1. Compared to prior study from ___, there is stable pulmonary
  edema.
  2. New opacity underlying the pacemaker battery site, which may be due to
  patient positioning but consolidation of the mid left lung cannot be excluded.
  Consider shallow oblique radiographs for further assessment.
  3. Stable compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine.
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 10:03 AM
  1. Compared to prior study from ___, there is stable pulmonary
  edema.
  2. New opacity around the pacemaker battery site, which may be due to patient
  positioning but consolidation of the mid left lung cannot be excluded.
  3. Stable compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with shortness of breath, scapular pain
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph studies from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are low. Compared to prior study from ___, there is
 air-space opacity projecting over the lateral mid lung, partially obscured by
 the pacer battery site, and consolidation due to infection cannot be excluded.
 Bilateral prominence of interstitial markings is grossly unchanged.   Two
 channel pacer positions are unchanged. There is no pleural effusion.
 
 There is stable compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine.  Chronic
 deformity with subluxation/dislocation of the right shoulder is again seen.
 
 No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Compared to prior study from ___, there is stable pulmonary
 edema.
 2.  Airspace opacity underlying the pacemaker battery site is seen projecting
 over the left mid lung not well evaluated due to partial obscuration by the
 overlying pacemaker battery, but underlying consolidation due to infection may
 be present. Consider oblique radiographs for further assessment.
 3. Stable compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine.
