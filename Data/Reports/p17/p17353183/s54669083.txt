                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, back pain. Assess for pneumonia or
 congestive heart failure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates intact median sternotomy
 wires. Patient is status post aortic valve replacement. Again seen is a
 pacemaker device projecting over the left anterior subcutaneous tissue with
 catheter tip within the right atrium and right ventricular apex.
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bibasilar
 atelectasis. Stable mild cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 Scar in the right upper lobe with associated surgical sutures are again noted.
 Mild retrocardiac opacity best assessed on frontal radiograph is most
 consistent with atelectasis and is similar to previous examination dated ___.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable and visualized osseous
 structures are notable for anterior compression fracture of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body, unchanged from previous examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
 2.  Stable anterior compression fracture of a lower thoracic vertebral body,
 unchanged from previous examination.
