                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of critical AS status post TAVR.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 New, prosthetic aortic valve projects over the heart.  Again seen are surgical
 clips overlying the right lateral chest wall, hemithorax, and neck. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Increased retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle may suggest a small pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, left basilar atelectasis.
