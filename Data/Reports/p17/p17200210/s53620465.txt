                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post laparoscopic colectomy, now with colonic perforation
 and subsequent repair.  Please evaluate for fluid overload or other
 respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ as
 well as CT abdomen and pelvis performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a right
 central venous catheter line, endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube with
 subsequent development of right lower lobe opacification possibly due to right
 lower lobe collapse and increased small right pleural effusion, though
 findings could represent infectious process.  Retrocardiac opacity is
 relatively unchanged.  Bilateral small pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left lower lung opacification and new right lower lung
 opacity may represent combination of right lower lung collapse and a small
 pleural effusions but cannot exclude infectious process.
