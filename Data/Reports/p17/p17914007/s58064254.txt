 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:46 PM
  Interval progression of bilateral pleural effusions, as well as increased
  perihilar opacity, likely due to pulmonary edema.  Low lung volumes with
  bibasilar atelectasis.  A tube is seen coursing across the right hemithorax,
  coursing superiorly and at out of view, which appears external to the patient.
  The right upper quadrant drainage catheter, and the enteric feeding tube are
  unchanged in position.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, pleural effusions, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The pre-existing pleural effusions as well as the bilateral areas
 of atelectasis might have slightly increased.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly.  No signs of overt pulmonary edema.  No new focal parenchymal
 opacities suggestive for pneumonia.
