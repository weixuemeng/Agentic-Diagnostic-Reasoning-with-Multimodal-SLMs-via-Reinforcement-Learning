                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent hepatectomy, readmission, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement
 with decrease of the bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent improved
 ventilation of the lung bases bilaterally.  Small effusions, however, persist
 at both the right and the left lung base.  The heart continues to be minimally
 enlarged.  No new focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax.
