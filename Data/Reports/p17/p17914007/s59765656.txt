                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___ AT 7:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis status post left IJ placement,
 evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 1:17
 a.m.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 7:52 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over
 the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.  Left internal jugular central line
 has its tip in the proximal SVC abutting the lateral wall.  No pneumothorax. 
 Bilateral layering effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities
 likely reflecting atelectasis.  Probable interval development of mild
 perihilar and interstitial edema.  Cardiac contours are difficult to assess
 due to the bibasilar airspace process.  Mediastinal contours appear stable. 
 No pneumothorax.  Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with prior
 cholecystectomy.  Abdominal drainage catheter remains in place.
