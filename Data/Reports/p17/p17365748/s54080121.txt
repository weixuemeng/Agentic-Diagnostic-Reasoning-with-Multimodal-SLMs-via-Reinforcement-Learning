                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man ESRD on PD, and hypoxemia  // Is there e/o
 pulmonary edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomegaly is accompanied by
 worsening interstitial pulmonary edema, accompanied by a small right pleural
 effusion.  A more confluent opacity centrally at the right lung base could
 reflect asymmetrical dependent edema or a secondary process such as aspiration
 or developing infectious pneumonia.  Short-term followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
