                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new cough and elevated wbc  // ? infiltrate 
 ? infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Previous moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema has improved compared
 to ___ but I cannot say what happened in between these 2 studies.  If the
 edema cleared in the interim, it has recurred.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Transvenous right
 atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.  Lateral view
 shows heavy calcification in the ascending thoracic aorta which may be present
 in the aortic valve as well and could indicate aortic stenosis.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.
