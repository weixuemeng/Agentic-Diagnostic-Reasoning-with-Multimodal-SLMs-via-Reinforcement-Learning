 HISTORY:  Left chest pain for several hours.  Evaluate pneumonia, effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions, best seen on lateral view.  There
 is no definite focal consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Subtle opacities over the lower lungs relate to breast implants.
