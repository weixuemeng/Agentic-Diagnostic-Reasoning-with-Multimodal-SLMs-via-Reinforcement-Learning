                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man p/w C5 cord injury c/b left lower lobe infiltrate
 // eval left lower lobe infiltrate      eval left lower lobe infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  Left lower lobe
 consolidation began developing on ___ and has been severe, without
 improvement since ___.  Since the mediastinum remains shifted to the
 left I suspect this is largely atelectasis, although concurrent pneumonia is
 not excluded.  It suggests poor clearance of secretions, perhaps due to
 bronchial occlusion or weekend diaphragm or cough reflex.  Clinical
 correlation advised.
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion, heart size is normal.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is midline.
