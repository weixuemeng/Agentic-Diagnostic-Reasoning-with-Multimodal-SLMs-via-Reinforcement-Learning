                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVC.  Evaluate for rib fracture.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are extremely low.  Crowding of the vasculature is likely due
 to the low lung volumes, rather than pulmonary edema.  There is no focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 There is a displaced fracture through the surgical neck of the humerus, which
 is only evaluated in one AP view.  No definite rib or spine fracture is
 visualized on this limited supine exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Displaced humeral neck fracture.
 2.  Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process or evidence of a rib
 fracture.
