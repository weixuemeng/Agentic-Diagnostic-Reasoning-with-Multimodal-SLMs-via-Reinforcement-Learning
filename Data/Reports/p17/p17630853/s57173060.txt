                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  A ___-year-old male with history of cough,
 fevers/chills.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Mild medial
 right lung base opacity may represent overlapping vascular structures,
 although an underlying mild consolidation cannot be excluded, although it is
 not clearly seen on the lateral view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right infrahilar and medial right base increased opacity could be
 due to infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting.
