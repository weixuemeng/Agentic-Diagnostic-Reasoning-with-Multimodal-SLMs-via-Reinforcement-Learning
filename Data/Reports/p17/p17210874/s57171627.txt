                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.  Streaky left basilar
 retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis but infection or aspiration is
 not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. The right lung is clear.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky left basilar retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis but
 infection or aspiration not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
 Consider dedicated PA and lateral views when/if patient able, for further and
 better evaluation.
