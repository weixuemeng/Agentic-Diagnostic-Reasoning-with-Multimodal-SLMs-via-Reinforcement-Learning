                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with intractable seizures and intubated.  Evaluate
 placement of the endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed approximately 4 hours prior to this
 exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 6 cm above the carina.  An
 esophageal tube is present with both the side port and tip below the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Otherwise the lungs are well expanded.  Bilateral
 hilar engorgement with associated diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening,
 alveolar infiltrates and Kerley B lines suggest interstitial pulmonary edema. 
 There might be a small amount of fluid tracking along the minor fissure in the
 right.  There is left lower lobe atelectasis with an associated small pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings compatible with pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis with associated pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  Esophageal tube is with the
 side port and tip beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
