                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Extubated patient with stroke and seizure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 ET tube is no longer visualized.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is
 obscured by pleural parenchymal abnormalities.  Moderate pulmonary edema has
 minimally improved.  Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis are grossly unchanged allowing for differences in
 positioning of the patient.
