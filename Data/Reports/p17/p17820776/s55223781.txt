                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with left juxta-hilar lung mass, status post VATS
 for biopsy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Postoperative chest radiograph from ___ and
 preoperative chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval removal
 of a left chest drain.  Opacification of the left juxta-hilar region is
 similar to prior pre-operative examination, findings corresponding to site of
 known mass.  Overall aeration of the lungs is improved with decreased basilar
 atelectasis and vascular congestion.  Mild blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle is consistent with a small effusion and is unchanged from prior. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Linear vertical opacity within the left upper lung likely
 reflects subsegmental atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval left chest tube removal.  No pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Decreased pulmonary vascular congestion and improved aeration of the
 lungs.
