                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New-onset atrial fibrillation.  Evaluate for fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  Patchy
 right lower lobe opacities are suggestive of atelectasis.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 trachea is normal in course and caliber.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy right lower lobe opacities, suggestive of atelectasis; if there is
 any clinical concern for pneumonia, however, short-term follow-up radiographs
 could be considered.
 
 2.  Mild cardiomegaly.
