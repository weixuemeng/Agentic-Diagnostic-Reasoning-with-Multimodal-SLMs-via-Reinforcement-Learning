                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. 
 Minimal linear opacity within the left lower lobe likely reflects subsegmental
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  No evidence of
 congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
