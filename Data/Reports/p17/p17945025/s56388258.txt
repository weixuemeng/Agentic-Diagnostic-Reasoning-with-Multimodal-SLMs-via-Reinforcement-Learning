 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:14 AM
  5.7 x 4.5 cm fairly well-circumscribed mass obscuring the right heart border
  which may represent a pericardial lipoma/cysts or an intraparenchymal process.
  Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with with AMS and aphasia. h/o CVA.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a well-circumscribed opacity at the right lung base measuring
 approximately 5.7 x 4.5 cm.  Although this obscures the right heart border,
 this is relatively dense and there is the suggestion of an abnormality to the
 underlying right tenth rib.  This may reflect a chest wall abnormality rather
 than a true parenchymal abnormality.  Recommend CT chest to further evaluate. 
 The left lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 5.7 x 4.5 cm well-circumscribed mass at the right lung base.  The right heart
 border is not well visualized suggesting a right middle lobe location. 
 However, given the deformity of the underlying right tenth rib and the density
 of the lesion, this may reflect a chest wall lesion and Chest CT is
 recommended for further evaluation.
