 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Tracheostomy
 appears in appropriate position.  Left PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Heart
 size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Irregular opacities overlying
 both lung bases, right greater than left, are compatible with infection.  The
 left costophrenic angle is excluded but no substantial pleural effusion is
 visualized.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar irregular opacities, right greater than left,
 compatible with pneumonia.
