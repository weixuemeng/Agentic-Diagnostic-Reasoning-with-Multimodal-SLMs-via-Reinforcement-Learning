                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY  ___M s/p fall from moving vehicle w/ multitrauma, GSC 3 at
 scene w/ devastating neuro injury/severe ICH w/shift   herniation, C1-C3 fx, L
 hemothorax, rib fxs, L. elbow lac to joint  // eval PNA    eval PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  There is streaky density at the lung bases consistent
 with subsegmental atelectasis.  There is additional hazy density at the right
 lung base suggestive of pleural fluid.  A small focal area of consolidation at
 the right base cannot be excluded.  The heart and mediastinal structures are
 unchanged.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Subsegmental atelectasis.  Focal opacity at the right lung
 base likely representing pleural fluid and volume loss. A small focal area of
 consolidation at the right base cannot be excluded, however.
