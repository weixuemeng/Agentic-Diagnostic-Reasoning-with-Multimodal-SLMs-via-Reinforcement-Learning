 difficult to oxygenate now on APRV  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 increased. This could be the result of better inspiration or of increased
 ventilatory pressure.  Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm with subsequent atelectasis at the right lung basis
 and, potentially, the presence of a small to moderate right pleural effusion. 
 The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged.  Unchanged course and
 position of the nasogastric tube. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No
 pulmonary edema.
