                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of chest pain.  Please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly has slightly increased in size compared to the
 prior exam from ___.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Subtle increase in retrocardiac opacity is likely secondary to
 atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increase in opacity at the retrocardiac region is likely
 secondary to atelectasis; however, an infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded.
