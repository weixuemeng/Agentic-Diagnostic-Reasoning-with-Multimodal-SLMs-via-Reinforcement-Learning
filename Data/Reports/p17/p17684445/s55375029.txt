                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload. Question pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is redemonstration of low lung volumes which accentuate the
 bronchovascular structures. Increased opacities at the lung bases bilaterally
 are likely secondary to atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Mild prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.
