                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Falls over the past week.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Hilar contours are stable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
 or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
 may be present.  No definite fracture is seen, although if there is concern
 for rib fracture, dedicated rib series is more sensitive or dedicated imaging
 of the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
