                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F pedestrian struck by motorcycle, polytrauma  s/p ex-lap
 w/mesenteric lac/avulsion  // interval change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  Continued opacification at the right base again could reflect
 atelectatic changes or possibly even be a manifestation of superimposed
 pneumonia or contusion.  The left hemidiaphragm is less well seen and there is
 blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss at the left
 base and pleural fluid.
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
