                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with polytrauma  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent prior from ___.  Chest CT ___.  CT abdomen pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left PICC is present with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  ETT
 and enteric tubes are stable in position with a ETT terminating near the
 thoracic inlet no less than 5 cm from the carina with the chin down.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is resolved on the
 current exam.  Lung volumes are low, similar to most recent prior, with
 atelectasis bilaterally but no new focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.  Curvilinear lucency under the right hemidiaphragm medially is
 concerning for pneumoperitoneum.  Gaseous distension of the stent is is
 stomach is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube no less than 5 cm from the carina with the chin down.
 2.  Possible small amount of pneumoperitoneum under the right hemidiaphragm,
 not definitely present on prior radiographs and increased compared to the most
 recent prior CT abdomen pelvis.
 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis but no pleural effusion or
 pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1.  Advancement of ETT by several cm for more optimal
 positioning.
 2. If there is clinical concern for increasing pneumoperitoneum, CT abdomen is
 recommended for further evaluation.  Alternatively, if clinical concern is
 low, an upright or left lateral decubitus view may be obtained for further
 evaluation.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the
 telephone on ___ at 11:28 AM.
