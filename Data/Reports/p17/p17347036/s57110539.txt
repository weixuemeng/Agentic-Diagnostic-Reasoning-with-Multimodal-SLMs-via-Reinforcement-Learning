                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath on exertion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Kyphotic curvature of the thoracic
 spine is mildly exaggerated with several mid through lower compression
 deformities, mild-to-moderate in degree, that appear chronic.  The bones
 appear demineralized.  Rightward convex curvature is centered along the lower
 thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Cardiomegaly. 
 Probably chronic multiple mid-to-lower thoracic compression deformities.
