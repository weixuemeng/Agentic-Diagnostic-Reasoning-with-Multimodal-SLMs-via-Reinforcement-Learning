                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post endotracheal intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above
 the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.  The heart is
 probably at the upper limits of normal size, perhaps with a left ventricular
 configuration. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
 The lung apices, particularly on the left, are partly excluded, but visualized
 lung fields appear clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation; tube terminating 7 cm above the carina. 
 Orogastric tube terminating in the stomach.  No evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
