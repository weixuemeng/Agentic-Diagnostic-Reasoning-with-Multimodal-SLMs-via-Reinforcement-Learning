 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post recent median sternotomy and mitral valve
 surgery.  Right apical pneumothorax has nearly resolved with only a tiny
 residual pneumothorax remaining.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the
 post-operative period.  Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are similar on the
 right and slightly improved on the left.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 persist, left greater than right.
