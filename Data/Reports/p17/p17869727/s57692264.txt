                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with syncope x3.  History of endocarditis. 
 Question heart size.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  Linear opacities at the lung bases suggestive of
 atelectasis versus scarring, not significantly changed from prior.  The lungs
 superiorly are clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal, unchanged from prior.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.  Surgical clips in the upper abdomen suggest
 prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Linear opacities at
 the lung bases, most suggestive of atelectasis or scarring.  However, clinical
 correlation is suggested to exclude component of infection.
