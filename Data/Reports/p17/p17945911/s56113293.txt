 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, edema, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pleural effusion on
 the right has moderately decreased.  The signs indicative of pulmonary edema
 have decreased in severity.  The cardiac silhouette is still moderately
 enlarged.  Atelectases are seen at both lung bases.
