 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Bibasilar opacities are again seen which may be
 due to atelectasis although underlying infection is difficult to exclude. 
 There is increase in the interstitial markings bilaterally as compared to the
 prior study which may be due to a component of edema.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.  Cardiac and
 internal silhouettes are stable.
