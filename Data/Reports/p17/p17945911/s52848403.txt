                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Basilar
 atelectasis are seen.  There is increase in perihilar markings which may be
 due to vascular congestion; however, an atypical infection is not excluded. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace effusions are difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes
 are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Basilar atelectasis.  Prominence of the
 interstitial markings may be due to fluid overload; however, atypical
 infection is not excluded.  Recommend followup.
