                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. 
 Subtle bibasilar opacities are seen, similar compared to the prior study that
 may be due to atelectasis and underlying chronic lung disease.  No definite
 new focal consolidation is seen, although would be difficult to exclude in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  No large pleural effusion is seen, there is
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, and a small pleural effusion
 is difficult to exclude.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
