                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, on amiodarone, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes with accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.  Persistent
 engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with vascular
 congestion.  Small pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the
 bases.
 
 Of incidental note is an abnormal appearance to the distal clavicle on the
 right, possibly related to previous surgery.
