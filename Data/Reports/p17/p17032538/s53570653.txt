                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post pituitary resection, now with copious
 respiratory secretions.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina.  The endogastric
 tube tip sits within the stomach, although a portion of the weighted tip sits
 above the GE junction.  The heart size is within normal limits.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable.  The lungs continue to
 demonstrate heterogeneous opacity in the right mid and lower portion, which
 may represent an area of scarring.  Additionally, more scattered punctate
 densities throughout the right and left lung are compatible with calcified
 pleural plaques as confirmed by the visualized chest portion of the abdominal
 and pelvic CT from ___.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Right mid and lower lung scarring and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
