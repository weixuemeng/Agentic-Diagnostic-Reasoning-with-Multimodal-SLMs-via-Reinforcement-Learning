                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:34 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Craniotomy.  Diabetes insipidus and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lower lobe, and
 overlying pleural calcification are longstanding, but previous pulmonary edema
 in this location has improved if not resolved, leaving behind a small residual
 right pleural effusion.  The left lung base was relatively clear on ___ and also developed some edema, which has decreased since ___. 
 Given the severe scarring in these lungs, some pneumonia could be present and
 not appreciated, for example, just projecting over the right hilus, but in the
 left lung, there is no evidence of pneumonia.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  The heart is not
 enlarged.  Right pleural thickening is most extensive at the apex and
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
