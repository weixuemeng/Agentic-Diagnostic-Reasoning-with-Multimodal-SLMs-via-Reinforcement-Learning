                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever, dyspnea, and crackles in the left lower
 lobe.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs from ___, dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate intact median
 sternotomy wires and vascular clips in the mediastinum, unchanged since the
 prior study.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The lungs are
 well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal
 consolidation.  Peribronchial cuffing is slightly more prominent compared to
 prior studies, compatible with mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumonia.
