                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.  Question pneumonia or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The lung volumes are low.  Allowing
 for low lung volumes, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal
 limits.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities, which suggest crowding of
 vascular markings associated with low lung volumes without definite focal
 opacity suggestive of pneumonia.  Mild pleural thickening is present at each
 lung apex.  The bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
