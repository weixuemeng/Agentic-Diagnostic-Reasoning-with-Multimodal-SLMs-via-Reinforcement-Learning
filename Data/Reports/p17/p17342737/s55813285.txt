                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness breath and wheezing.
 
 Question congestive heart failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates pronounced
 mid-to-lower thoracic right convex scoliosis.  The ascending aorta and aortic
 arch appear tortuous and partly calcified.  The heart is normal in size.  The
 lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural
 effusion.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch. 
 Moderate thoracic spondylosis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process including no evidence of
 congestive heart failure.
 2.  Pronounced thoracic scoliosis.
 3.  Tortuous aorta, which can be seen with hypertension; clinical correlation
 is suggested.
