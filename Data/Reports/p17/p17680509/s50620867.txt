                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation for endotracheal tube location.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. 
 The nasogastric tube and the right subclavian line are unchanged.  Unchanged
 moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and a small left pleural
 effusion.  New bilateral apical opacities that could reflect pneumonia or
 atypically distributed pulmonary edema.  In retrospect, a small part of the
 opacity was already present on the previous image, notably in the left upper
 lobe.
