                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Accidental intubation of bronchial system with nasogastric tube,
 placement of a new nasogastric tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
 been re-positioned.  The tube is now located in the esophagus, with its tip
 projecting over the proximal parts of the stomach.  The sidehole is at the
 gastroesophageal junction.  For optimal positioning in the stomach, the tube
 should be advanced by approximately 5 cm.  The appearance of the lung
 parenchyma is unchanged.  No evidence of complications after a previous tube
 malposition.
