                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  For nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the nasogastric
 tube extends to the upper-to-mid portion of the body of the stomach.  The side
 hole is probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction.  If possible to
 push the tube somewhat further, this would be advisable.
 
 The opacification at the left base appears to be increased.  Again, this could
 reflect increasing pleural effusion with an appearance worrisome for
 supervening consolidation.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests
 some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 The left subclavian catheter has been pulled back into the brachiocephalic
 vein.
