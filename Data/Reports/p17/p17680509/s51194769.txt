 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pulmonary edema, consolidative pleural effusion, question
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than
 right, have increased consistent with worsening pneumonia.  Opacities in the
 left upper lobe have improved . Opacities in the right upper lobe are grossly
 unchanged.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.  .
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia worsened in the left lower lobe.
