                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle opacity overlying the right lower lobe. 
 Otherwise, the left lung is clear.  The cardiac silhouette is normal.  There
 are no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.  No acute fractures are
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle increased opacity overlying the right lower lobe is likely
 representative of atelectasis.  However, an early developing pneumonia may be
 present in the proper clinical setting.
