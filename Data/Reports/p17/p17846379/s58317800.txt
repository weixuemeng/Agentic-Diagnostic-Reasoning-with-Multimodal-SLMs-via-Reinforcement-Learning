 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:33 PM
  Compared to study dated ___, there has been interval development of a
  large right lower lung opacity, likely centered within the right middle lobe,
  although likely more extensive. Left lower lung opacity is also present. These
  findings are concerning for pneumonia.  Evaluation of the right costophrenic
  angle is limited due to overlying hardware. No left pleural effusion is
  detected on these frontal views. Biapical pleural densities may represent
  pleural thickening or fluid. No pneumothorax is detected. These findings were
  discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 20:30 on ___.
