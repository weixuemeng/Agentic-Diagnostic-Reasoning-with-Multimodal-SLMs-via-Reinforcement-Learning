 but there is a residual small left pleural effusion and persistence of
 consolidation at the base of the left lung, which has dramatically improved on
 the right.  Heart size is normal.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  ET
 tube tip is at the upper margin of the clavicles, permitting advancement by
 2-3 cm to improve seating.  Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
