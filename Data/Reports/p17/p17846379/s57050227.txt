                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 14:52
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, endotracheal tube advanced 5 cm,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 12:25.
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 2:50 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube is now visualized with its tip at the thoracic inlet but
 still approximately 8 cm above the carina.  Gastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 2.  Persistent bibasilar airspace opacity with likely associated pleural
 effusions.  There is increasing pulmonary vascular cephalization and
 indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity which is consistent with worsening
 moderate pulmonary edema and probable partial lower lobe compressive
 atelectasis secondary to the pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The
 left costophrenic angle and lateral chest is not completely included on the
 current examination.  Cardiac size and mediastinal contours is stable.
