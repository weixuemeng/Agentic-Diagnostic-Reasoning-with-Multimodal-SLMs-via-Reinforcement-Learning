                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right effusion with decreased breath sounds.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is increased hazy
 opacification of the right hemithorax consistent with substantial pleural
 effusion.  This appears to have increased since the previous study, though
 some of this could reflect differences in patient position.
 
 There is some increasing prominence of the cardiac silhouette with engorged
 and indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with increased pulmonary venous
 pressure.  The right subclavian catheter tip appears to be further than
 previously, at least to the cavoatrial junction and possibly to the upper
 portion of the right atrium.
