                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased heart rate.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Substantial pleural effusion on the right persists, but has
 not increased.  The indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, is no worse than on the previous
 study.  The tip of the central catheter is unchanged.
