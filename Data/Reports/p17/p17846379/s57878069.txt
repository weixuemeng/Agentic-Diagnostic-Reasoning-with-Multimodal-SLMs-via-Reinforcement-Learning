                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia and CHF.  Now with desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC ends in the mid SVC.  A moderate right pleural
 effusion has slightly decreased in size.  A persistent consolidation at the
 right base is likely atelectasis, although an underlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  At the left base, there is new decreased lung
 transparency, particularly adjacent to the heart border.  This likely
 represents new pneumonia or atelectasis.  Would recommend short term follow up
 with repeat radiographs.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New opacification at the left base may represent early pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Would recommend short term follow up with subsequent
 radiographs.
 2.  Slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion.
 3.  Persistent consolidation in the right base is likely atelectasis, although
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
