                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:21 A.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Pancytopenia.  Respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Small
 pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 No detectable pneumothorax.  Opacification at both lung bases could be
 posteriorly collected pleural effusions, but differentiating that from
 consolidation or atelectasis is difficult.  A lateral view would be extremely
 helpful.  Pulmonary edema has not recurred.  Heart is normal size. 
 Hyperinflation indicates severe COPD.  Right jugular line ends in the upper
 SVC.
