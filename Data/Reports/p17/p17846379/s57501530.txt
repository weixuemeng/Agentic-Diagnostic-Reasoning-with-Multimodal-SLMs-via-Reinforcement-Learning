                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 20:57
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure requiring
 intubation, check placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 19:13.
 
 A portable semi-upright chest film, ___ at 20:57 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip approximately
 10 cm above the carina.  The tube should be advanced approximately 4 cm.  The
 patient's nurse, ___, was notified by phone on ___ at 8:42 a.m. the
 need for repositioning.
 2.  Both costophrenic angles are not included on this study.  There is a
 bilateral diffuse airspace process which again appears slightly improved
 favoring that this represents some moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema rather
 than diffuse pneumonia.  However, clinical correlation is advised.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No large pneumothorax
 appreciated.
