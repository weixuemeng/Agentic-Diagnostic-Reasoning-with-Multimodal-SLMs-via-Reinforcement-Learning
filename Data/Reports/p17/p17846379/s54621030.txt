 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  New right lower lobe infiltrate followup.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There continues to be obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm with
 increased alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe.  The right effusion is
 slightly smaller; however, there is also an area of increased alveolar
 infiltrate in the left lower lung likely representing a small new infiltrate
 in that region.  The right-sided PICC line with tip in the distal SVC is again
 visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved appearance on the right, worsened appearance in the left
 lower lobe.
