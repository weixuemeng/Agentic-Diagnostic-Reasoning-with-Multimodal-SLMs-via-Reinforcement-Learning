                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of MDS and neutropenia with
 weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a large right pleural effusion may be minimally decreased
 in comparison to prior study.  Right basilar atelectasis is again noted. 
 Additionally, there is a new subtle opacity in the left lower lobe. 
 Otherwise, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Right PICC appears stable
 with the tip at the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased left basilar opacity.  While this may be simple atelectasis, a
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Large right pleural effusion.
