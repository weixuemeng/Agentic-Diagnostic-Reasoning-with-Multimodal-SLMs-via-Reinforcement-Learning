                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with past medical history of psychosis presents with
 fever to 100.9 and right "rib pain"
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic, with similar blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle likely reflective of chronic pleural thickening. 
 Thickening along the right minor fissure however suggests the possibility of a
 trace right pleural effusion as well.  Apart from minimal right basilar
 atelectasis, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are on remarkable.  Hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  No acute osseous
 abnormality is clearly noted.  Remote fracture deformities of several
 right-sided ribs are unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Thickening of the right minor fissure with blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle may suggest the presence of a trace right pleural effusion. Chronic
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No acute osseous abnormality
 identified.  Chronic right-sided rib fractures.
