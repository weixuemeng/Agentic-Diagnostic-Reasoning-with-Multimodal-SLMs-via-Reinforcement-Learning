                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman has a PICC that was moved  // picc placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The PICC line tip is only minimally higher than on the prior exam and is in
 the distal SVC.  There has been interval increase in the left pleural effusion
 which is now large in layering posteriorly with only a small amount of aerated
 lung in the superior left upper lobe.  The right hemidiaphragm is obscured
 secondary to volume loss/ infiltrate/ effusion.  This is a worsened appearance
 compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsened appearance to the lungs.  .  Some of this may be due to fluid
 overload but an infectious infiltrate in either lower lobe can't be excluded
