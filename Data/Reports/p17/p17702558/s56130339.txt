                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with malignant pleural effusion s/p pleurex  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Despite the presence of a left basilar chest tube, the large left pleural
 effusion has increased, and now contributes to near complete opacification of
 the left hemithorax.  Given the lack of appreciable mediastinal shift, there
 is also likely increased ipsilateral atelectasis.  The right lung remains
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Metallic clips in the right upper quadrant
 indicate prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A combination of increased large left pleural effusion and worsening
 atelectasis causes new near complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
