 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left pleural effusion and pleurex on place
 // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pleurex drain catheter tip projects over the left lower hemithorax. Moderate
 left pleural effusion persists and is probably slightly worse with increased
 rightward shift of the right heart border compared to the prior exam despite
 coexisting left atelectasis.  Remaining aerated left lung is overall similar
 in appearance with perhaps slightly improved aeration of the left lung apex.
 The right lower lung is grossly clear. The heart is severely enlarged. 
 Calcification of the aortic knob unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent and slightly worse moderate-to-large left pleural effusion despite
 Pleurex placement.
