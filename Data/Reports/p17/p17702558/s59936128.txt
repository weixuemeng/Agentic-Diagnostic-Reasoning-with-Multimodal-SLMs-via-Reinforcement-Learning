                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with Pleurex in place for malignant pleural
 effusion  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a chest tube at the left lung base.  Also again seen is
 extensive opacification of the left lung.  Allowing for technical differences,
 the degree of residual aeration at the left lung is relatively similar.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  As previously suggested, there is probable volume
 loss on the left, with persistent slight leftward shift of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 The right lung shows upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora as
 well as right base atelectasis.  Vascular plethora may be slightly greater. 
 No right-sided effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent opacification of the left lung, overall similar to ___
 at 05:54
 2. Mild vascular plethora, equivocally slightly greater, as seen in the right
 upper lung.
 3. Minimal opacity at the right base is probably similar allowing for
 technical differences.  Question atelectasis, but attention to this area on
 followup films is requested to exclude developing pneumonic infiltrate.
