                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Previous pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a persistent large left-sided pleural effusion although with overall
 volume loss and mild leftward shift of mediastinal and cardiac structures. 
 Overall quantity of fluid is probably fairly similar and, given overall volume
 loss, extensive atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula is suspected. 
 Right lung remains clear.  There is no pleural effusion.  Heart is probably
 enlarged but its contours are partly obscured.  Aortic arch is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar large left-sided pleural effusion with extensive atelectasis including
 overall volume loss in the left hemithorax.
