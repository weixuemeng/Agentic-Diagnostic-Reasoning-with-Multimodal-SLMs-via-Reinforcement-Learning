 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemoptysis intubated and sedated  // compare
 to prior      compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16 24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 04:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. 
 There is improving aeration in the left hemithorax but persistent
 consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes consistent with lobar
 atelectasis, infection, or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  There is likely a layering effusion.  The right lung also has
 improved aeration suggesting that there likely was a component of superimposed
 edema.  No obvious pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to the left hemithorax airspace process.
