 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.  Endotracheal tube
 continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet.  There is increasing opacity
 at the left upper lobe with shift to the left favoring left upper lobe
 collapse, although superimposed infection or a central mass cannot be
 excluded.  Patchy bibasilar opacities are also seen possibly representing
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.  Heart is are stable in
 size given differences in patient positioning.
