                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Lung cancer and chemotherapy presenting with chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:
 Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours show substantial decrease in a
 left hilar mass.  This suggests a positive treatment response although bulging
 character to the aortopulmonary window is concerning for residual tumor or
 metastatic lymphadenopathy.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked decrease in left hilar mass.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 disease.
