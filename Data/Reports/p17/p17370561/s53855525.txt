                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.  Rule out dissection.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 REPORT:
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  The heart is probably at the
 upper limits of normal for size.  Lungs are clear.  Mediastinum appears
 grossly unremarkable.  No effusion is noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Normal study.  No findings suggestive of dissection.  CT is suggested if
 strong clinical concern persists.
