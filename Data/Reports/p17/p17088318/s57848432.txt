                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Presenting with left supracondylar fracture.  Preoperative
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bibasilar
 consolidation most likely representing atelectasis, but underlying infectious
 process cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well seen due
 to this finding.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen and pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
