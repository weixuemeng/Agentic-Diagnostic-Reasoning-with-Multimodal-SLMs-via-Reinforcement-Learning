                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p PPM and having chest pain  // ?interval
 changes      ?interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study in this date, the pacer device is
 essentially unchanged and there is again no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 Suggestion of asymmetry in the right apical region, though some of this could
 merely reflect superimposed bony structures.  There is mild increase in
 interstitial markings, which could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Some asymmetry on the left could be a manifestation of developing
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
