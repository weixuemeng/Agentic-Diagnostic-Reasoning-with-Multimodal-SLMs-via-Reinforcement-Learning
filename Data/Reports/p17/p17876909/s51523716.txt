 ?interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the hazy opacification at the right
 base has substantially decreased.  This could reflect substantial clearing of
 layering pleural effusion, or merely be a manifestation of a more upright
 position of the patient.
 Continued opacification at the right base would be consistent with the
 clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.
 The left lung is essentially clear except for mild basilar atelectatic
 changes.
