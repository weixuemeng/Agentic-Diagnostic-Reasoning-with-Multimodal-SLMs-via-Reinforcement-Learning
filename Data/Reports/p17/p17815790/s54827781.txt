                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with coffee ground emesis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip and right PICC tip terminate in the low SVC.  A
 metallic stent spans the mid and distal esophagus, in similar position
 compared to the previous examination.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are decreased in size compared the previous
 radiograph with associated bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  More focal nodular opacity is also noted projecting over the
 peripheral aspect of the left mid lung field, new in the interval.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected. 
 Bilateral breast implants are incidentally noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size compared to the prior
 study, with associated bibasilar atelectasis.  More focal nodular opacity
 projecting over the peripheral aspect of the left mid lung field appears new,
 and could reflect additional site of atelectasis but infection or inflammation
 is not excluded.
