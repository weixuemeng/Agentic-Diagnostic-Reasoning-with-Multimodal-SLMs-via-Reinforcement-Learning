 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:10 AM
  
  
  Comparison is made to chest port line placement radiograph dated ___. 
  A left chest port is present, its tip which terminates at or just below the
  cavoatrial junction.  A right PICC terminates at approximately the mid to
  distal superior vena cava.  An esophageal stent is again noted.
  
  Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate, left greater than right, increased
  in size relative to prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.  No consolidation
  is identified.  Bilateral heart borders are obscured limiting evaluation of
  heart size.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath and a new O2
 requirement.  Evaluate for worsening pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right upper extremity PICC and the left chest Port-A-Cath terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  The esophageal stent is again noted.  Compared to the
 prior study, there has been increase in bilateral pleural effusions, now large
 on the left and moderate on the right with adjacent compressive atelectasis. 
 The cardiac silhouette is obscured due to the parenchymal abnormalities.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, now large on the left and
 moderate on the right.
