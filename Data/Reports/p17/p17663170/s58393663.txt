                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with picc  // eval for picc placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 08:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC is grossly stable in position, terminating at the
 brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  The lungs remain hyperinflated, in keeping with
 COPD.  Chronic lung changes are noted at the lung apices.  Left upper lobe
 patchy opacity projecting over the posterior left fifth rib, while could
 relate to vascular structures and/or scarring, underlying pulmonary lesion is
 not excluded.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, best seen on the
 lateral view.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided PICC terminates at the brachiocephalic/ SVC junction.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 COPD.  Left upper lobe patchy opacity projecting over the posterior left fifth
 rib, while could relate to vascular structures and/or scarring, pulmonary
 lesion is not excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonurgent chest CT for further evaluation of left upper
 lobe findings.
