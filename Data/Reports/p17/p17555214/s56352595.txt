                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
 A chronic opacity in the right upper lobe appears unchanged on the frontal
 view although more compact and dense on the later view.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear. The chest is mildly hyperinflated.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased degree of volume loss associated with chronic right upper lobe area
 of atelectasis or scarring, which may reflect waxing and waning atelectasis. 
 Superimposed infection is not entirely excluded, however.
