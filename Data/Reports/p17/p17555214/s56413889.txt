                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___ AT ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  Check NG tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube has been advanced and is now in the stomach.  There is
 an opacity in the right mid lung that is more apparent on the current study
 than on priors.  It is unclear if this represents overlapping shadows, area of
 scar tissue, a new infiltrate or less likely a mass.  Attention should be paid
 to this area on followup.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriately positioned NG tube.
 2.  Focal abnormality in the right mid chest for which followup is
 recommended.
