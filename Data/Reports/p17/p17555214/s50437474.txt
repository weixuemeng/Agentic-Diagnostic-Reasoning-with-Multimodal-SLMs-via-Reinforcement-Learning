 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, evaluation for feeding tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a right partly pleural,
 partly parenchymal opacity, projecting over the anterior portion of the third
 right rib, is unchanged in extent and severity.  There is also unchanged
 evidence of retrocardiac atelectasis.  The patient has received a Dobbhoff
 catheter.  The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter
 projects over the middle parts of the stomach.  No complication, notably no
 pneumothorax.
