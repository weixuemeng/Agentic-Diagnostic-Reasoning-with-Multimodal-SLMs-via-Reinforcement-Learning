                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p liver transplant here with SBO, now with
 fever.  // Pneumonia? Acute process?      Pneumonia? Acute process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Peribronchial opacification in the lower lungs, particularly the left, could
 be scarring, but pneumonia is would be easy to overlook.  On the right, in a
 region of previous scarring involving the subpleural right lung along the
 major fissure, there is larger region of roughly crescentic opacity which, in
 the presence of new small bilateral pleural effusions is probably fissural
 fluid.  Heart size is also slightly larger, suggesting that cardiac
 decompensation could be responsible for all of the changes.
 
 Nevertheless, because of the complexity of these findings, I would strongly
 recommend chest CT scanning if there is series clinical concern for pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT scanning if there is serious clinical concern for
 pneumonia.
