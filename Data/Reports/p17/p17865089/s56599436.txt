                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old status post exploratory laparotomy for
 perforated antral ulcer, transferred in septic shock, likely secondary to
 re-perforation, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___ hours.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film of ___ at 6:00 a.m. is
 submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval intubation with an endotracheal tube approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Subclavian central line with its tip in the mid superior vena cava. 
 Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip coursing below the
 diaphragm but not identified on the current study.
 2.  Bilateral layering effusions, right much greater than left.  There are
 patchy bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  No pneumothorax.
