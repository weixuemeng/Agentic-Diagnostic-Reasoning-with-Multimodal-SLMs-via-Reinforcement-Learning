                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate NG tube.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  ET tube is in standard position.  Left
 subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Large right pleural effusion is
 stable.  Bibasilar atelectases, greater on the right, are unchanged.  Left
 pleural effusion is better seen in prior CT.
