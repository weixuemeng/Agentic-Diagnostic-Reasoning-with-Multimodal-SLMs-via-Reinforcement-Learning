                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chest pain.  Question acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates evidence of prior
 CABG and median sternotomy.  The lungs are mildly hyperinflated allowing for
 somewhat lordotic patient positioning, suggestive of emphysema.  There is
 minimal interstitial edema.  The heart is top normal in size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 2. Findings suggestive of underlying emphysema.
