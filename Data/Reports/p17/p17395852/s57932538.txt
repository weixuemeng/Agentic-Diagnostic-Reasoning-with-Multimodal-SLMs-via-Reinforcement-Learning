 secondary to this rotation.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Mild atelectasis at the left base is evident.  No displaced rib fracture is
 detected within the limitations of portable chest radiograph. L1 compression
 fracture is again seen.
