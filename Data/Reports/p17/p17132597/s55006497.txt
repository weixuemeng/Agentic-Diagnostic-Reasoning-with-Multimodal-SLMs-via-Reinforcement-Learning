                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with copd // acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi upright portable radiograph the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are quite low, accentuating the heart and mediastinal size,
 and causing crowding of the pulmonary vasculature.  The lungs are grossly
 clear, with no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, overt pulmonary edema, or focal
 consolidation.  No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Low lung volumes likely account for accentuated heart size.
 2. Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider reimaging with conventional radiographs at full
 inspiration to ensure no cardiomediastinal enlargement.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. Dr.  ___  on ___ at 2:09 AM, 1 minute after discovery of the
