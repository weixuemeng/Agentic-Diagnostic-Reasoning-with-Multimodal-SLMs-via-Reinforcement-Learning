                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough and had cold for one week.  Please
 evaluate for acute infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume and show minimal interstitial opacities, which are
 likely accentuated due to the low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal.  The mediastinal silhouette shows a prominent right paratracheal
 stripe.  There is prominence of both hila, right greater than left, better
 seen on the lateral view.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No acute intrathoracic process.  Enlarged right hila and right paratracheal
 stripe could be related to adenopathy. A chest CT is recommended for further
 evaluation.
