                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is slightly rotated towards the left.  Heart size is
 top normal with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Lungs are clear.  Small focus of pleural thickening at the
 right apex is likely chronic.  Pleural surfaces are otherwise clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No fracture is identified,
 though dedicated rib series may be helpful if there is focality on exam.
