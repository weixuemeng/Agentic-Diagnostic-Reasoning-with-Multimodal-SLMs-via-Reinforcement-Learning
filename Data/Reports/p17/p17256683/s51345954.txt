 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right thoracentesis, question
 pneumothorax.  
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted and compared to
 prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval decrease in size of a left pleural effusion presumably related to
 recent thoracentesis.  Clinical correlation is advised, however, as the
 requisition's clinical history said that the thoracentesis occurred on the
 right side.  No pneumothorax.  Improved aeration of the left base with
 residual streaky linear opacities suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Heart remains upper limits of normal in size. 
 Mediastinal contours are stable.
