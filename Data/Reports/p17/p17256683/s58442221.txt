                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line has been removed.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear probably unchanged.  There is persistent opacification of the
 left lower hemithorax suggesting a combination of parenchymal opacification
 and pleural effusion.  Possible etiologies include pneumonia or widespread
 atelectasis involving the left lower lobe and perhaps portions of the lingula.
 The degree of leftward shift of mediastinal structures is similar to the prior
 study.  An opacity projecting over the left upper lobe has substantially
 improved.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.  There is a small-to-moderate
 subpulmonic effusion on the right, visible only on the lateral view, probably
 with associated atelectasis.  A deformity of the left distal clavicle is
 unchanged and probably post-traumatic.
