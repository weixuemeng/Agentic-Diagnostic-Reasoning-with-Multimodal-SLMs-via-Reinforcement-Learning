                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, status post intubation.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4.8 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach.  A right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid
 SVC.  
 
 Again, there are bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominantly at the bases,
 which are in keeping with an infectious process.  Additionally, there are
 worsening interstitial opacities, suggesting worsening edema.  A small left
 pleural effusion appears grossly stable.  A small right pleural effusion has
 likely slightly increased in size.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening interstitial opacities, suggesting interval worsening of
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Grossly stable parenchymal opacities, likely infectious.
 3.  Stable small left pleural effusion.  Increased small right pleural
 effusion.
