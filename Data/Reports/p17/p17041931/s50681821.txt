                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND ___)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with afib  // amio safety screen      amio safety
 screen
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is extensive
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with triple lead pacer with unchanged
 position.  Moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema is again seen.  Opacification
 at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
 No definite evidence of amiodarone related toxicity, though in view of the
 extensive pulmonary changes it would be difficult to detect basilar
 interstitial prominence.
