                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Diabetes, hypoglycemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Projecting over the
 left lower hemithorax, there is a rounded 3.5 cm structure which on the
 lateral view appears to project over the skin of the left breast.  Correlate
 for external artifact at this location.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
