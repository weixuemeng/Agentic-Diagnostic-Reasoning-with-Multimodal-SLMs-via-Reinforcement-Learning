                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  Ringing in ears in intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a small
 calcified granuloma in the left lower lobe, as before; otherwise the lungs
 appear clear.  A mixed lytic and sclerotic bone lesion along the left anterior
 lateral fourth rib appears unchanged allowing for differences in technique and
 accordingly suggests a benign finding.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Stable rib lesion.
