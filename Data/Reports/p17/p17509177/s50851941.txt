                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with s/p chest tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from earlier today as well as a CT chest
 from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   A chest tube is seen projecting over
 the left hemidiaphragm though its exact position is difficult to assess on
 this single frontal portable radiograph.  The left lung is significantly
 re-expanded when compared with the prior CT performed earlier today and the
 left effusion has nearly resolved with mild residual left basal atelectasis
 noted.  There is persistent opacity in the right upper and lower lungs which
 remain concerning for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
 unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
