                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and dysphagia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is patchy left lower lung opacity
 obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, probably within the lingula, which is
 non-specific but most suggestive of minor atelectasis.  There is no evidence
 for pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  Bony
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the lingula, most suggestive of minor
 atelectasis.  Pneumonia is difficult to completely exclude, although doubted. 
 Short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered if clinically indicated. 
 No evidence for pneumomediastinum or mediastinal widening.
