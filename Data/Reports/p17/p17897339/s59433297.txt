                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Bibasilar
 opacities are seen, which most likely represent atelectasis, although
 aspiration or infection are not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
