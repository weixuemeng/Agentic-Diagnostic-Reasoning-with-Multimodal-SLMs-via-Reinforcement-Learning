                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed on ___ at 08:58. 
 
 Technique:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The inspiratory lung volumes remain low with an unchanged large hernia
 containing bowel in the left hemi thorax.  Right middle lobe atelectasis is
 slightly improved from the most recent prior study.  No other focal
 consolidations are noted.  There is no increase in size of a small right
 pleural effusion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  The cardio mediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated but
 likely within normal limits and unchanged.  Again there is a large hiatal
 hernia with mildly distended contents but unchanged.    
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly improved right middle lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, unchanged
 appearance of the chest including large hiatal hernia with mildly distension
 of contents.  Clinical correlation is recommended regarding the current
 clinical relevance of the finding.
