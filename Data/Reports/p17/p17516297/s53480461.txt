                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again, there are low lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette is obscured due to
 the patient's known large hiatal hernia.  This again, limits assessment of the
 left lower lobe.  There is adjacent left lung atelectasis.  Right lung base
 atelectasis is also seen.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is persistent severe compression of a mid to
 lower thoracic vertebral body and mild to moderate compression of a vertebral
 body at the thoracolumbar junction.
