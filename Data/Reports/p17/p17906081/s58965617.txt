                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with stable intracranial hemorrhage not on
 anticoagulation with wet cough and rhonchorous lung exam  // evidence of PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiac silhouette is upper limits
 of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and slight
 worsening of a bilateral reticular pattern.  Although potentially due to acute
 pulmonary edema, followup radiographs are suggested to exclude an underlying
 more chronic interstitial process.  A confluent opacity in the left lower lobe
 could potentially represent an evolving infectious pneumonia given clinical
 concern for this entity.  No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
