                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Volvulus with nasogastric tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the abdomen.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Nasogastric tube tip projects over the medial aspect of the right
 hemidiaphragm and appears to terminate within a large hiatal hernia which is
 distended with air and fluid.  The cardiac silhouette size is moderately
 enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Bibasilar ill-defined opacities may
 reflect aspiration or atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion appears to be
 present.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Electronic device is seen projecting over the left perihilar region.  Cervical
 spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Nasogastric tube tip appears to terminate within a large hiatal hernia, which
 is distended with air and fluid.  Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect
 aspiration or atelectasis.  Small right pleural effusion.
