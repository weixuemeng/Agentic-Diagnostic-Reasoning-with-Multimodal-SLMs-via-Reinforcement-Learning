                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Labored breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is
 increased opacification at the right lung base compared to the prior study,
 which likely represents a combination of increased atelectasis and a small
 pleural effusion. The left lung is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. An
 enteric tube is again seen with tip in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification of the right lung base, reflecting
 increased atelectasis and a possible small pleural effusion.
