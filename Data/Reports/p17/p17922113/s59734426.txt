                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of diabetes, presenting with
 tachypnea and no bowel movement for a week.  Evaluate for intra-abdominal free
 air in the KUB or acute cardiothoracic process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 However, there is a radiolucent region overlying the left hemidiaphragm which
 appears separated from the inferior aspect of the heart.  This region is
 incompletely evaluated due to multiple external monitoring devices.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiothoracic process.  However, a
 radiolucent region with possible depression of the left hemidiaphragm is
 incompletely evaluated and may be artifactual.  A repeat examination with PA
 and lateral views is recommended for complete evaluation of this region.
