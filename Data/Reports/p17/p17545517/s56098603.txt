 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Mild patient rotation slightly
 limits evaluation.  The heart size appears normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Large substernal thyroid goiter is again noted
 which narrows and deviates the airway to the left.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities visualized including no
 displaced rib fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Thyroid goiter, which
 narrows and displaces the airway to the left.  No definite displaced rib
 fractures are noted, but if there is continued clinical concern, a dedicated
 rib series can be obtained.
