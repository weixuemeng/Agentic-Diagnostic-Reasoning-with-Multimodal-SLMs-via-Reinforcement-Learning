 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath, history of recurrent
 pleural effusions, evaluate for worsening pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is a large left side pleural
 effusion which has increased markedly since prior examination.  A small right
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  The visualized portion of the left lung and
 right lung are clear, without focal consolidations.  There is pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Heart size is difficult to interpret.  Aortic
 calcifications are noted.  Prominence of the right superior mediastinum is
 compatible with known goiter.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked increase in size in a now large left pleural effusion with
 mild pulmonary congestion.
