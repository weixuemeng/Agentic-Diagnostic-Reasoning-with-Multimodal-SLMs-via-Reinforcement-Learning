                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after thoracocentesis for
 the presence of pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 Current study demonstrates small amount of left pleural effusion with no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  Left mediastinal shift is present and most likely
 reflects persistent area of left lower lobe atelectasis.  Right lung is well
 aerated.  Small amount of right pleural effusion and minimal basal atelectasis
 are present.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, note is made that on
 ___, pericardial effusion had been demonstrated.
 
 Substantial left mediastinal shift of the trachea and narrowing of the coronal
 diameter of the trachea are related to multinodular goiter, better assessed on
 the CT chest with substantial retrosternal component.
