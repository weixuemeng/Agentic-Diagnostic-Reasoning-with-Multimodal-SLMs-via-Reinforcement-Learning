                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with RIJ CVL.  Verify line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ outside hospital chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation.  There is atelectasis,
 scarring, and/or a trace left pleural effusion at the left costophrenic angle.
 No pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.  Cardiomediastinal hilar
 silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.  The descending thoracic aorta is
 somewhat tortuous.  There has been interval placement of a right IJ central
 venous catheter, which terminates near the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 Irregularity of the lateral right third and fourth ribs raises the possibility
 of prior fracture.  Incidental note is made of multiple levels of
 vertebroplasties.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates near the superior cavoatrial
 junction, possibly in the proximal right atrium.
 2. There is atelectasis, scarring, and/or a trace left pleural effusion at the
 left costophrenic angle.
