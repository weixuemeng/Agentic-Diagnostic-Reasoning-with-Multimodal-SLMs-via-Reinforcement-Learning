                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pancreatic mass, cirrhosis, diffuse
 anasarca, new O2 requirement.  // ? pleural effusion, pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Increasing
 opacity involving the right lung is demonstrated and may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema and atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits and stable.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased right pleural effusion and increasing opacity throughout
 the lungs, particularly on the right, suggests increasing pulmonary edema and
 atelectasis.  Concurrent infection should be considered in the appropriate
 setting.
