                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is less
 prominent, as is the vascular pedicle.  This could reflect improvement in
 vascular status or the PA upright technique.  However, the pulmonary vessels
 are substantially less engorged, consistent with improving congestive failure.
