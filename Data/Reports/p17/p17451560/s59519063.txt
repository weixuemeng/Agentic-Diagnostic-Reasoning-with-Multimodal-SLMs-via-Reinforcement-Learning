                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, sputum, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette size is increased compared to the
 prior study, now appearing moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contour
 is unchanged. There is perihilar haziness with increased interstitial
 opacities suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. This appears to be superimposed
 on a background of mild chronic interstitial abnormality. No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no
 acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of mild chronic interstitial
 abnormality.
