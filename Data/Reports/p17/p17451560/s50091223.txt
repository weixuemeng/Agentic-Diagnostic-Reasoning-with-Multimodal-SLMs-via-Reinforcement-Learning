 WET READ: ___ ___ 12:05 AM
  Lung volumes slightly improved. Cardiomediastinal silhouette stably enlarged.
  Increased interstitial markings in the setting of a background interstitial
  abnormality, likely representing interstitial edema, not largely unchanged
  compared to yesterday's radiograph. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ILD possibly ___ amiodarone, dCHF, HTN,
 CKD, Afib on warfarin p/w dyspnea and cough of unclear etiology. Developed
 chest pain moments ago, SBP ___s.  // acute interval worsening of
 itnrathoracic process?    acute interval worsening of itnrathoracic process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes have improved.  Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary
 abnormality has changed in distribution, and improved slightly over night.
 Since chronic cardiomegaly is accompanied by mediastinal venous engorgement, I
 suggest the abnormality is largely edema. There is now the suggestion of lung
 nodules that could have been present but obscured previous. Conventional
 radiographs recommended when feasible. Pleural effusions are small if any.  No
 pneumothorax.
