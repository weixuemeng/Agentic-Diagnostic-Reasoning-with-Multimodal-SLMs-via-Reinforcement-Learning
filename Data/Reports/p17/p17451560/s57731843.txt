                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of congestive heart
 failure with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The heart is enlarged.  There is redemonstration of bilateral
 reticulonodular parenchymal opacities throughout the lungs that have
 progressed when compared to the prior exam.  Nodular opacities at the apices,
 right upper lobe, and the left upper lobe have progressed when compared to the
 prior exam.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  There
 is tortuosity of thoracic aorta.  There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum and
 osseous structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Progression of reticulonodular opacities within the lungs
 bilaterally as compared with recent CT Chest. The differential on prior CT
 included acute interstital pneumonitis, viral infection, and drug reaction. 
 However, superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.
