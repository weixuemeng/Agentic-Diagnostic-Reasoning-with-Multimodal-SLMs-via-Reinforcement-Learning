                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shaking chills.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderate to markedly enlarged, as before.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Central pulmonary arteries
 are again mildly enlarged.  There are streaky opacities in the right lower and
 left mid lungs, similar to the prior examination and suggesting minor scarring
 or atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 bones appear demineralized.  Degenerative changes appear similar along each
 shoulder and about along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest with no definite evidence of
 superimposed acute disease.
