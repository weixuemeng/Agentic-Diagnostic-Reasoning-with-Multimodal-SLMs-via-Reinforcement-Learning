                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities in both lung bases likely
 reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis and/or scarring.  No pleural
 effusion is identified, and there is no pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes of
 both acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints are again noted, as well as
 multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
