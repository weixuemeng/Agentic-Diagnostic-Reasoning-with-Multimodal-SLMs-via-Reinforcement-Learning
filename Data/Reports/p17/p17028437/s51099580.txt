                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with frequent pneumonia presenting with 1 day of lower
 abdominal pain  // eval for colitis, infection, obstruction
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.  CT abdomen pelvis from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Linear opacity within the right midlung
 likely represents a focus of scarring.  Left basal opacity is again noted
 which could represent atelectasis, though difficult to exclude pneumonia.  A
 small left pleural effusion is likely present.  No pneumothorax. Mediastinal
 contour stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basal opacity, question atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Likely small left
 effusion.
