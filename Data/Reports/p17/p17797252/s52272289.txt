  Compared with Portable view of the chest from same date from 7 hours and 2
  hours prior and single view of the chest dated ___
  
  In comparison to the most recent study, multifocal opacities are largely
  stable in appearance.  There may be minimal improvement in bolus and opacity
  in the right mid lung, possibly from diuresis.  Underlying nodular opacities
  remain.  Superimposed bacterial infection is not excluded.  Left-sided PICC
  line takes a slightly different course dilated previously, possibly related to
  patient positioning.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with known PNA and lymphoma, acute resp failure
 // any interval change? any PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs performed 2 hours earlier.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left-sided PICC line has a different course however the tip remains in the
 mid SVC. There is some slight improvement of the nodular opacities throughout
 both lung fields but more confluent within lung apices.
