                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion in a patient with
 altered mental status, tachypnea, and diffuse crackles on physical exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right PICC terminating in
 the right upper atrium.  Heart size is normal and the lungs are fairly
 well-aerated.  Opacity in the lateral left lower lung may represent
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The left costophrenic angle is not imaged, but
 within these limitations there is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Opacity projecting over the left lung base may represent atelectasis, but
 infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Short interval radiographic follow-up is advised.
