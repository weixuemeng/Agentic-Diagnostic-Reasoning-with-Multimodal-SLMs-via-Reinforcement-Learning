 atrium/cavoatrial junction.  New poorly defined left lower lobe and right
 upper lobe opacities are evident, and note is made of CT scan from ___,
 which showed extensive peribronchial ground-glass opacification.  Again noted
 is bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe.  No definite pleural effusion is
 identified.
 
 No definite acute rib fracture is identified.
