                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CMV pneumonia, now sounds quite crackly
 and is hypoxic  // pulm edema or other acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, there has been interval
 widening of the vascular pedicle accompanied by vascular engorgement,
 perihilar haziness and ill-defined perihilar opacities.  These findings are
 likely due to pulmonary edema superimposed upon underlying nodular pattern
 from known viral pneumonia.  Secondary Bacterial pneumonia complicating a
 viral infection is an additional consideration, and short-term followup
 radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard if the diagnosis is
 in doubt clinically.
