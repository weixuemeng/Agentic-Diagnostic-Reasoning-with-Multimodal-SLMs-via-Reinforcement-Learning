  In comparison to the recent study from 5 hours prior, there are worsening
  ill-defined, bilateral opacities superimposed upon a nodular pattern from
  known viral pneumonia.  While many of these findings may be attributable to
  edema, bacterial pneumonia is an additional consideration.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cancer decompensated  // STAT eval
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from 5 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There are again seen nodular and more
 focal opacities throughout both lung fields most prominent at the upper lobes.
 The more nodular opacities have increased slightly since the prior study. 
 There are no pneumothoraces or large pleural effusions.
