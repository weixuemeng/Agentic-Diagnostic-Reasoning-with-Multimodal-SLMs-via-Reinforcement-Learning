                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // eval ? PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes and the patient is rotated slightly to
 the left.  Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen.  Mild left
 base atelectasis is seen.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences
 in technique and patient position.  An ovoid 1.3 cm calcified left
 paratracheal structure may represent a calcified mediastinal lymph node.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with left base atelectasis.  No definite focal consolidation.
