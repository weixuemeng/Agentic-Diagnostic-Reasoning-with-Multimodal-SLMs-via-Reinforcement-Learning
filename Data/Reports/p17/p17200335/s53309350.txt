                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chest pain and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Right upper lung subpleural
 opacity, 11 mm in diameter, is noted.  Although it might represent
 fibronodular changes, correlation with prior imaging is recommended.  If not
 available, chest CT would be required to exclude the possibility of
 pleural/parenchimal lesion. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
