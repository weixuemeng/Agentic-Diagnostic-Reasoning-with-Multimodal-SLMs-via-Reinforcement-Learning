                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with alcoholic hepatitis, s/p 8 day ICU course,
 d/c CTX couple days ago. Has fever to 100.9. Looking for infectious source. 
 // Evidence of pneumonia? infiltrate?     Evidence of pneumonia? infiltrate?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extremely low lung
 volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  There is
 more prominence of interstitial markings that could represent pulmonary
 vascular congestion with basilar atelectatic changes.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could certainly not be
 excluded.
