                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with leukocytosis  // eval for pnuemonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies most recent dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A temporary dialysis catheter as no been exchanged for a tunneled right
 internal jugular catheter.  The tip is in the right atrium.  Compared to the
 prior study there is improved aeration of the bilateral lungs with resolution
 of the frank pulmonary edema.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with fluid overload.  There is linear atelectasis of
 the bilateral lung bases.  An airspace opacity adjacent to the right heart
 border may reflect atelectasis versus consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
 
 Atelectasis versus infection at the right lung base.
