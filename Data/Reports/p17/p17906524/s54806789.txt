                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  C. diff colitis with respiratory distress status post intubation. 
 Position of ET tube, evidence of free air under the diaphragm.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest most recent ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right IJ terminates in the low SVC.  The ET tube terminates 2.7 cm from
 the carina and should be withdrawn 1-2 cm cm.  The NG tube is in the stomach
 in the region of the pylorus.  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left,
 are worse on the left since yesterday and represent pleural effusions and
 atelectasis.  A heterogenous opacity in the right lower lung suggests
 pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Also, there is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic air. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis have
 worsened on the left since yesterday.  
 
 2.  A new right basal pneumonia is suspected. 
 
 3.  Within the limitations of portable radiograph there is no evidence of
 subdiaphragmatic air. 
 
 4.  The ET tube terminates to 2.7 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn
 1-2 cm.
