  ETT remains 3 cm from carina and should be retracted 1-2 cm.  Given
  differences in positioning, no significant change in volume overload with mild
  cardiomegaly, central venous congestion, interstitial pulmonary edema, and
  moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities may represent
  atelectasis or pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock and severe C. diff colitis.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the projection.  Moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, associated atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema are stable.
 ET tube is 3 cm above the carina and unchanged.  NG tube tip is out of view, 
 below the diaphragm.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC.
