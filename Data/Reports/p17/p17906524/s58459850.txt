 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 INDICATION:  ACS, questionable pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial
 improvement.  The pre-existing bilateral basal opacities have almost
 completely resolved.  There is evidence of mild persistent fluid overload,
 mainly manifesting as basal apical blood flow redistribution.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
