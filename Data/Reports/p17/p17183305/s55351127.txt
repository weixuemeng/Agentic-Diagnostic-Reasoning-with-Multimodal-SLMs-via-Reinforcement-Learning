                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with concern for cerebellar infarct  // acute
 process      acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  Massive overinflation persists.  However, the
 lung volumes have slightly decreased in the interval, moderate elongation of
 the descending aorta.  Right lower lobe parenchymal opacities have decreased
 but a new parenchymal opacity is visualized in the right upper lobe, raising
 concern for right upper lobe pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary
 edema.
 Given the presence of severe underlying chronic obstructive lung disease, the
 pneumonia must be followed radiographically until complete resolution.
