                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with right chest pain only associated with
 coughing, Positive history of bronchiectasis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are severely hyperinflated with flattened diaphragm, is due to emphysema
 or small airway obstruction.  Nodular opacities and rounded lucency, right
 worse than left, are due to severe bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction, which
 was demonstrated on chest CT from ___. Consolidation in the
 lingula has either recurred or incompletely cleared.
 Upon further evaluation of prior CT from ___, there is a nodular
 right paraspinal opacity which may be resolving previously seen masslike
 consolidation of the right lower lobe or a small mass obscured nodule by the
 since resolved consolidation.  Evaluation of this right paraspinal nodularity
 on current radiograph is not possible.  Heart size is top-normal.
 Trachea displaced at the thoracic inlet, by a thyroid nodule that was
 previously seen on CT. There is no evidence for pneumothorax, pleural effusion
 or pulmonary edema.  Opacity in the mid thoracic vertebra is likely a bone
 island, unchanged from prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent consolidation in lingula, which may be new or recurrent
 atelectasis or organized pneumonia.
 2. Severe bronchiectasis and nodular opacities appear stable since ___, but worse since ___. Given the combination of severe bronchiectasis and
 emphysema, active suppurative bronchiectasis due to non-tuberculous
 mycobacterial infection or alpha 1 trypsin deficiency should be considered, if
 not already investigated.
 3. Repeat chest CT upon resolution of acute symptoms is recommended for
 further evaluation of right paraspinal opacity seen on CT from ___.
 4. Displaced trachea likely from thyroid nodule seen on prior CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest CT upon resolution of acute symptoms is
 recommended for further evaluation of right paraspinal opacity seen on CT from
 ___.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the ___ ___ at 12:51 PM, 20 minutes after discovery of
 the findings.  Pertinent critical findings were posted by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 20:40 to the Department of Radiology online critical
 communications system for direct communication to the referring provider.
