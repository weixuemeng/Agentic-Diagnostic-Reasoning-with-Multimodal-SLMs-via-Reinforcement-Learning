                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with chronic productive cough  // aspergillosis
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Deviation of the trachea to the right, at the level of the thoracic inlet,
 likely caused by an enlarged thyroid.  Position other abnormality at the level
 of the right shoulder.
 The lung parenchyma shows rather centralized and right lower lobe predominant
 extensive bronchiectasis with signs of bronchial wall thickening. Coexisting
 ill-defined opacities in more peripheral lung zones could reflect was plugging
 or peribronchial foci of infection.  Typical signs suggesting ABPA are not
 visible.  No pleural effusions.  The lateral radiograph, however, reveals
 severe overinflation, consistent with chronic airways disease.  On the lateral
 radiograph only, a 1 cm lung nodule, projecting over the vertebral body, is
 visualized.  In addition, both the frontal and the lateral radiograph, show
 blunting of the cardiac border, caused by a lingular opacity, likely
 reflecting pneumonia.
 Overall, to determine the origin of the lung nodule and to assess the severity
 of the disease, in particular given the absence of previous image in, CT is
 recommended.
