 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy and linear
 opacities are seen within the left lung base and right mid lung field, likely
 areas of atelectasis though infection in the left lung base is not completely
 excluded. Small left pleural effusion is present.  No pneumothorax is
 identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.

 Patchy and linear opacities in the left lung base and right mid lung field
 which may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection in the left lung base
 cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Trace left
 pleural effusion.
