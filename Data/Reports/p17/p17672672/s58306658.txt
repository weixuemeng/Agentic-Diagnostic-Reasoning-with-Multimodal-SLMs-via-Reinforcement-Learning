                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with suspected hypoxic cardiac arrest  // Please
 eval for pulm edema, Please eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from same date, radiographs of the chest
 dated ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is central
 pulmonary vascular congestion as well as indistinct peripheral pulmonary
 vasculature.  Hazy bilateral opacities are noted, with scattered interlobular
 septal thickening.  These findings are consistent with pulmonary edema,
 minimally improved.  Superimposed consolidation is not entirely excluded. 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 Midline sternal wires are intact and well aligned.
 
 There has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube, with the tip
 terminating 3.5 cm above the carina.  A transesophageal tube is also in place,
 coursing into the stomach, with distal tip beyond the field of view of this
 radiograph,.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.   Findings consistent with pulmonary edema, minimally improved since prior
 radiograph of several hr earlier.
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.
