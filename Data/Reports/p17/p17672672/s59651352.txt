                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hyperglycemia vs seizure vs ACS  // ?cpd
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 and a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette.  The mediastinal contours are
 stable since the prior examinations.  New in the interval are pulmonary
 vascular congestion and bilateral, asymmetrically distributed perihilar
 opacities as well as a more focal opacity in the right upper lobe. 
 Superimposed infection is not excluded.
 
 Midline sternal wires are well aligned and intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, although superimposed
 secondary process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia are possible. 
 Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard, especially
 to assess for clearance of a more focal opacity in the right upper lobe.
