                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female recently intubated.  Assess ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Trauma radiograph from ___
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube has been advanced and
 now terminates at the level of the clavicular heads.  A nasoenteric catheter
 courses below the diaphragm and the tip is visualized just below the left
 hemidiaphragm indicating that it is coiled within the stomach.  Lung volumes
 remain low resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  Bibasilar opacities are
 similar to recent prior and are likely atelectasis.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Advancement of the endotracheal catheter to the level of the
 thoracic inlet.  No other change from recent prior.
