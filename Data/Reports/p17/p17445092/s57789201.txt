                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with history of rib fractures.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly, partially obscured by small-to-moderate left
 pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 right lung is clear.  Old healed fractures are seen in the posterior sixth and
 seventh right ribs.  More acute, displaced rib fractures in lower left ribs
 are difficult to evaluate given the presence of soft tissue swelling and the
 pleural effusion.  They are probably unchanged , better seen in prior CT from
 ___.
