                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 REPORT.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The lungs appear
 grossly clear.  There is some degenerative change within the thoracic spine
 with osteopenia and biconcave vertebrae.  Lateral view also suggests mild
 pulmonary hyperinflation.
 
 There are no definitive findings suggestive of pneumonia.  Generalized patchy
 linear and especially left retrocardiac opacities visualized suggest bronchial
 wall thickening
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Essentially normal chest radiograph.No definitve pneumonia.Bronchial wall
 thickening
