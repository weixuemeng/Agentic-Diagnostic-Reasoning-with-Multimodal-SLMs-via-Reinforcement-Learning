 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Retrocardiac opacity is mostly
 consistent with known hernia.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No appreciable
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Consolidation in the left lower
 lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
