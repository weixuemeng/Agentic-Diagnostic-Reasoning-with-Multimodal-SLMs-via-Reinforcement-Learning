                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Leukocytosis of unclear etiology.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and CT abdomen from ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is persistent, most likely reflecting large hiatal hernia as well as
 small amount of pleural effusion.  The upper lungs are essentially clear. 
 There is linear opacity on the lateral view, anterior to the cardiac border,
 not included in the CT of the abdomen, potentially might reflect area of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen.
