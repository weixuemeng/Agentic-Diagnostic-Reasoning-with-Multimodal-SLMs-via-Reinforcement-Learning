                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with medical thoracoscopy.  // chest tube
 evaluation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:17
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, a right-sided chest tube has since been placed
 at the right lung base.  The previously seen right pleural effusion is
 markedly smaller, nearly completely resolved.  There is minimal residual
 collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung base.  Hyperlucency at the
 right lung base likely represents a small basilar pneumothorax.
 
 Again seen is pleural fluid and/or thickening extending from the right lung
 apex along the right lateral chest wall, unchanged.  There is minimal
 atelectasis at the left lung base with blunting of left costophrenic angle
 unchanged.  No overt CHF.  Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of right chest tube, with near complete resolution of
 the right base pleural effusion.
 2. Probable small pneumothorax at the right lung base.  No right apical
 pneumothorax is identified.
 3. Interval improvement in collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung
 base, with some residual opacity present.
 4. Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
