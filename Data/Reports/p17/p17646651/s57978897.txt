                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent pleural effusion now s/p
 thoracoscopy w CT placement x 2  // assess interval change please. PLEASE
 SCHEDULE FOR 5AM. thank you!
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 45
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen are 2 chest tubes at the base of the right lung, where a small
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 As before, there is some density at the base of the right lung parenchyma,
 likely atelectasis.  Also as before, there is fluid and/or pleural thickening
 tracking from the lung apex down along the right chest wall.  However, the
 right costophrenic angle remains well-defined, without interval accumulation
 of right pleural fluid.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is similar to the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change.  Small pneumothorax at base of right lung is similar to
 the prior film.
