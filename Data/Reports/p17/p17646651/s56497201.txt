 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a right-sided hydropneumothorax.  Component of pneumothorax is
 relatively small with a moderate pleural effusion.  Right basilar opacity
 could be due to atelectasis although superimposed pneumonia would certainly be
 possible.  Linear left basilar opacities is likely atelectasis or scarring. 
 Small left pleural effusion is noted.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic
 arch.  Degenerative changes are noted at the shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided hydro pneumothorax.  Right basilar opacity could be due to
 atelectasis although superimposed infection or mass lesion is possible. Small
 left effusion.
 
 RECOMMENDATIONS:  Followup will be necessary to exclude underlying lesion.
