                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleurax effusion  // eval      eval
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, a PleurX catheters in place on
 the right, where there is little overall change in the basilar opacification
 consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis.  Less prominent
 effusion and atelectasis is seen at the left base.  Substantial enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the aorta is again seen with little
 or no vascular congestion.  This discordance raises the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy.
