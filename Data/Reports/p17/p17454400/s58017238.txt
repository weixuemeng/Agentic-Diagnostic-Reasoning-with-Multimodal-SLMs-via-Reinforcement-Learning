 HISTORY:  AVR, interval change.
 CHEST (PA & LAT)
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with mild prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present,
 with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.  
 
 There is patchy increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and probable small left effusion.  There is
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and minimal atelectasis at
 the right base.  No CHF.  Curvilinear lucency adjacent to the left hilum is
 noted, ? some pericardial or, less likely, mediastinal emphysema.  There is a
 small left apical pneumothorax, better seen and slightly larger than on
 ___.  A small amount of free air is seen under the right hemidiaphragm,
 unchanged.
