                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-op day 4, assess left apical pneumothorax.  
 
 AP chest, 1 vw
 
 Aain seen is a left apical pneumothorax that is slightly smaller compared with
 ___ at 9:55 a.m.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again
 noted is a small amount of pericardial air along the left heart border left a
 small amount of intraperitoneal subdiaphragmatic air on the right, which
 appear essentially unchanged.  Remaining findings are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left apical pneumothorax, slightly smaller than one
 day earlier.
