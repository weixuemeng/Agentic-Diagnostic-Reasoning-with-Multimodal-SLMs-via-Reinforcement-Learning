                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 right basilar opacity in relative linear configuration, most likely
 representing atelectasis or scarring, although infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity in a relatively linear configuration may be
 due to atelectasis, although underlying infection is not excluded.
