 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
 lower lobe pneumonia has almost completely cleared.  However, a small
 band-like density increased lung parenchyma persists on both the frontal and
 the lateral radiographs.  There is no evidence of complications such as
 pleural effusions or abscess formation.  Normal appearance of the heart and
 the mediastinal structures.  Minimally increased density at the level of the
 right lung apex, potentially positional in origin.  This change should be
 monitored, together with the complete resolution of the right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
