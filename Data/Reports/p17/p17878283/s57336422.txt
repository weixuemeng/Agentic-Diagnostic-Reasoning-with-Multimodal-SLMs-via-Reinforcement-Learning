                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There is
 mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is mild compression of a mid
 thoracic vertebral body seen on the lateral view of indeterminate age given
 lack of priors for comparison.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Clear lungs.  Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
 2.  Mild compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate age,
 given lack of priors for comparison.  Recommend clinical correlation for
 acuity and additional imaging as warranted.
