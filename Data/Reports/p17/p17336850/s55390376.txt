                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with severe multiple sclerosis, now with concern
 for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the stomach. 
 Stable, borderline cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. 
 Slight interval improvement in low lung volumes bilaterally.  Persistent
 retrocardiac opacity suggests atelectasis.  Stable opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic sulcus could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.  Interval
 resolution of small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in lung volumes bilaterally.  Stable bibasilar
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
 excluded.
