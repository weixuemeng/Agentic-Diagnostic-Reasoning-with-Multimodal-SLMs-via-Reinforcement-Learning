                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect AP portable view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient's overlying chin obscures the lung apices.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Blunting of the right greater than left costophrenic angles are seen
 which may be due to trace pleural effusions.  Difficult to exclude
 consolidation at the lateral left lung base.  No definite consolidation seen
 elsewhere.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Suboptimal evaluation of the lung apices due to patient's overlying chin.
 
 2. Slight blunting of the left greater than right bilateral costophrenic
 angles may be due to small pleural effusions.  Lateral left basilar
 consolidation not entirely excluded.
