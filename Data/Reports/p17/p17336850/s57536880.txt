                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:49 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after eight days of antibiotics for
 hospital-acquired pneumonia, persistent fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are low, and there is still some opacification at the base of the
 left lung, though improved since ___, could be persistent pneumonia.  I
 would strongly recommend conventional radiographs obtained in the department
 for more reliable assessment.  Heart is top normal size.  Pleural effusion is
 minimal if any.  Upper lungs clear.
