                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A lordotic projection was obtained.  Heart size appears mildly enlarged,
 similar to the previous study.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unchanged.  There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution compatible with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No definite focal consolidation, large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however, the right costophrenic
 angle is not completely encompassed in the field of view.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
