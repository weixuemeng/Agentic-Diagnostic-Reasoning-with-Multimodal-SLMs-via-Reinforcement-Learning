                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right subclavian line placement  // line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 04:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has
 been interval placement of a right subclavian line which terminates in the low
 SVC.  Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes are otherwise unremarkable in
 appearance.
 
 Lung volumes remain low, with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Left
 retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, although infection or
 aspiration could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is likely normal, accounting for
 portable technique.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right subclavian line terminates in the low SVC.  Otherwise no relevant
 change.
