 aeration
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are still extremely
 low lung volumes.  Retrocardiac opacification is again seen consistent with
 volume loss in left lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion.  The shift
 of the mediastinum to the left is less pronounced, suggesting some decrease in
 the degree of mucous plugging.
 The right lung is essentially clear.
