                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of cardiomyopathy and heart failure,
 now presenting with cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lungs are clear.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusions.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. 
 Moderately severe cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to prior examination.  An
 AICD generator overlies the left chest wall.  The lead appears intact,
 terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly consistent with history of known
 cardiomyopathy.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or focal consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.
