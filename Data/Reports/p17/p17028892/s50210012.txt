 HISTORY:  New IJ line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.

 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of pneumonia. The
 left hila is denser and larger than the right. 
 
 IMPRESSION:

 from adenopathy and/or calcifications. Recommend PA and lateral views of the
