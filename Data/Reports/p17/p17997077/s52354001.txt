 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Cough.  Assess for pneumonia.  None.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographdemonstrates mildly hypoinflated lungs
 with crowding of vasculature.  Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is only
 seen on frontal projection.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size,
 mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity only seen on frontal projection is most
 consistent with right lower lobe atelectasis however superimposed infection
 cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
