                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dual-lead chamber pacemaker. 
 Confirm lead placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker.  The lead tips are seen within the
 right atrium and right ventricle and are intact without any discontinuation. 
 There is some left ventricular prominence.  There is some coarsening of the
 bronchovascular markings without overt pulmonary edema. A prominent gastric
 bubble is seen.  There are no focal consolidations or pneumothoraces.  The
 lateral view demonstrates hyperexpansion of lung fields, suggestive of
 emphysema as well as calcification in anterior longitudinal ligament,
 consistent with DISH. There is mild wedging of several thoracic vertebral
 bodies.
