                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea on exertion while walking today
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, increased
 since prior exam in ___, which may be due to worsening cardiomyopathy or
 pericardial effusion. The mitral valve annulus is extensively calcified. The
 aorta is tortuous with calcifications seen at the arch. Mild blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle likely represents a small pleural effusion.  Lungs
 are hyperinflated but otherwise clear.  No pulmonary edema is present.  Severe
 degenerative changes are seen in the bilateral shoulders with chronic
 appearing subluxation, as well as within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, increased since
 prior exam in ___, may be due to worsening cardiomyopathy or the presence of
 a pericardial effusion.
 2. Small right pleural effusion.
 3. Severe degenerative changes of the bilateral shoulders and thoracolumbar
 spine.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   Consider further assessment with echocardiogram.
