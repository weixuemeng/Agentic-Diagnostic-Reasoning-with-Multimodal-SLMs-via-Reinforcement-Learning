                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal distention and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ and chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 The heart size is top normal. Widespread reticular interstitial opacities are
 due to fibrotic interstitial lung disease, seen and described on the CT
 examination from ___. Generalized increase in lung density is most
 readily explained by concurrent mild pulmonary edema.  Left perihilar
 opacification is either asymmetric edema, or possible pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension are chronic. Mild pulmonary
 edema is likely.  Left upper lobe edema is most prominent, alternatively
 pneumonia.
