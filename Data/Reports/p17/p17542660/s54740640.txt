                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decreased oxygen saturation.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged since the prior study.  There is
 substantial enlargement of main pulmonary artery and both right and left
 pulmonary arteries, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities are widespread throughout the lungs involving
 both lungs as well as old lung fields.  In comparison to the prior examination
 they have slightly increased.  The findings might reflect a combination of
 chronic interstitial lung disease as well as superimposed overload of fluid. 
 Small amount of right pleural effusion is noted.  Given the abnormalities
 within the lung bases partially demonstrated on CTA from ___, further
 assessment of the chest CT is required to exclude the possibility of
 underlying lung disease, which potentially leads to the evident pulmonary
 hypertension.  Partial contribution of hilar lymphadenopathy to be enlarged
 hila cannot be entirely excluded and can also be assessed on chest CT.
