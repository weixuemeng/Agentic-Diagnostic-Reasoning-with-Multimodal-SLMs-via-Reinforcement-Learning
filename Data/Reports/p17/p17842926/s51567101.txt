 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exaggerated thoracic kyphosis and aortic calcifications are again noted. 
 Deviation of the trachea to the right is chronic and may relate to an enlarged
 thyroid gland. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Lungs are clear. A
 focal opacity inferior to the left clavicle and lateral to the aortic arch was
 present previously and likely represents prominent costochondral
 calcifications. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial change compared to prior study.  No evidence of pneumonia.
