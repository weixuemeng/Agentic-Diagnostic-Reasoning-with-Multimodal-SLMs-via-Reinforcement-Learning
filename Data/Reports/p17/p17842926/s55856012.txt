                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  New pedal edema.  Question congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Mitral
 annular calcifications are prominent.  The aorta is largely calcified.  As
 seen previously, there is rightward deviation of the mid trachea probably
 associated with thyroid enlargement and unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  There is mildly
 exaggerated kyphotic curvature, as before, with mild multilevel degenerative
 changes seen throughout the mid to lower thoracic spine.  The bones appear
 demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
