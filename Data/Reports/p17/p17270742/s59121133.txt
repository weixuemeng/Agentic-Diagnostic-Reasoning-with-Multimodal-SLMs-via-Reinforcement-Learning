                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with HIV/AIDS, on PCP prophylaxis with known
 aspergilloma.  With cough and productive sputum and hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, most recent chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  A dominant right cavitary lesion is
 stable in size but demonstrates slightly less fluid and more gas than on the
 ___ study.  The smaller cavitary lesion at the right lung apex is
 stable in appearance.  The left upper lobe consolidation has slightly
 decreased in size although the small area of central lucency is stable in
 size.  Bilateral areas of ground-glass and patchy opacities appear overall
 stable in appearance and distribution.  Observed findings are consistent with
 widespread pulmonary infection. There are no new areas of consolidation. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
