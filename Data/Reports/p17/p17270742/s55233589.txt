                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with AIDS.  Recurrent PCP and invasive
 aspergillosis.  Assess change over three weeks.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small left pleural effusion and worsening of bibasilar peribronchial
 infiltration indicate progressive infection.  There is more internal debris in
 the large cavitary lesions in both upper lobes, which could be retained
 hemorrhage.  The fluid contents of the very large right lung abscess have
 decreased suggesting continued internal aspiration, which may account for the
 worsening of bibasilar infiltration.
