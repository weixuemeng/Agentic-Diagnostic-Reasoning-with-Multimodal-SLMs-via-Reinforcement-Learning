 Right-sided PICC terminates in the lower SVC.  Normal cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours.  Slight interval improvement in markedly low lung volumes
 bilaterally, which may be partly positional.  Stable, moderate right basilar
 atelectasis.  Interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis may reflect
 deeper inspiration.  Small, persistent left pleural effusion.  No

 pleural effusion.  Increased, moderate pulmonary edema.
