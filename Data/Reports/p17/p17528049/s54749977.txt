                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Positive blood cultures.  Assess for interval change in left
 lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the lateral view, a basilar opacity is could reflect pneumonia
 or atelectasis; however, no frontal correlate is seen to aid in localization. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Numerous calcified granulomata
 are again noted.  The heart is normal in size.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar opacity seen only on the lateral could reflect focal
 atelectasis or early pneumonia.  Followup PA and lateral radiographs can be
 obtained for further assessment.
