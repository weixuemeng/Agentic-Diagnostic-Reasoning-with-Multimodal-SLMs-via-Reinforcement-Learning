 Well-controlled HIV.  Smoker.  Lung cancer.  Prior right upper lobectomy. 
 Productive cough for three weeks.

 radiograph from ___:
 
 Prior right-sided lobectomy is responsible for pleural scarring at the base of
 the right hemithorax and elevation of right hemidiaphragm.  Left lung and
 pleural space are normal.  Nipple shadows should not be mistaken for lung
 nodules.  Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  No evidence of
 intrathoracic infection, recurrent or new malignancy.
