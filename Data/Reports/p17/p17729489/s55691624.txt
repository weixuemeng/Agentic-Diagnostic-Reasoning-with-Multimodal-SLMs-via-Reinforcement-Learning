                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 moderate pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infectious process is not entirely
 excluded.  Trace blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
