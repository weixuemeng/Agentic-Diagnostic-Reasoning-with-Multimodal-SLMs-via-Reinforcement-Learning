                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman status post fall with right hip fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Cardiac
 silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 grossly unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation. 
 Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view
 could suggest pleural thickening or tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild multilevel degenerative changes
 seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles
 posteriorly on the lateral view could suggest pleural thickening or trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.
