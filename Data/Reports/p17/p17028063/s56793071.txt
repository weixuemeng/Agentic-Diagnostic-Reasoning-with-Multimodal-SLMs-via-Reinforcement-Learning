                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count and delirium.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The heart is normal in size and there is no
 vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification overlying
 the lower spine could well represent merely a combination of pulmonary vessels
 and streaks of atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
