                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and dyspnea, to assess for right pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of
 the hemidiaphragms suggests some chronic pulmonary disease.  There is some
 asymmetric opacification at the left base with poor definition of the outer
 aspect of the hemidiaphragm.  Although this could merely reflect atelectasis,
 in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
