                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency in the upper lungs,
 suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary emphysema. 
 Subtle left base opacity may relate to overlapping structures although early
 consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic changes consistent with COPD.  Questionable subtle left base opacity
 adjacent to the left heart border unclear whether overlapping structures or
 focal consolidation.  Dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest would be
 helpful for further evaluation.
