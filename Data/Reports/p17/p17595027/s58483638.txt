                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known seizure disorder. Presented with prolonged seizure activity in
 the setting of pneumonia, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 23:35 p.m. and allowing for differences in
 technique, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen are opacities at
 both lung bases, slightly more pronounced at the left base.  Also again seen
 is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No gross effusion.
