 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Seizure disorder, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  There is evidence of increased bilateral
 pleural effusions and increase in subsequent bilateral basal areas of
 atelectasis.  The changes are slightly more severe on the right than on the
 left.  There is ongoing minimal fluid overload but no current evidence of
 pneumonia.  The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be slightly
 enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
