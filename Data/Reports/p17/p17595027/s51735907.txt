                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with known seizure disorder and
 pneumonia.  Hypoxic after transferred from INR.  ETT placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  The patient
 remains intubated, and ETT again seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above
 the level of the carina.  An NG tube remains in place, again the position of
 the side port is close to the hiatal area, further advancement may be
 indicated as before.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, but similar
 as on preceding examination, the relatively high positioned diaphragms result
 in crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, and plate thin bilateral
 peripheral atelectasis are noted, but there is no evidence of significant
 pleural effusion or acute pulmonary infiltrates.  No evidence of pneumothorax
 in the apical area.  In comparison with the next preceding study, the chest
 findings are stable.
