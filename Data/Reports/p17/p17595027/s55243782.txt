                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and failure.
 
 CHEST AP
 
 The position of the various lines and tubes is unchanged.  There is evidence
 of pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions, larger on the right than the
 left.  Right-sided effusion is, however, slightly somewhat smaller than it was
 on the prior occasion.  The lungs are also better expanded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Some improvement in degree of failure.
