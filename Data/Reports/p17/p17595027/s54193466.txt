                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Extubation with NG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it
 crosses the lower margin of the image.
 
 Continued low lung volumes with bibasilar opacifications most likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  The degree of
 opacification at the right base has decreased.
