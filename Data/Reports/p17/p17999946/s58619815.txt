                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Palpitations and chest pressure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  The aortic arch shows patchy calcification.  Mild subpleural
 thickening is unchanged at each lung apex for the most part, but there is an
 apparent increase in density in the left upper lung over about 1 cm region. 
 Otherwise, the lung fields appear clear.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Possible new left apical lung nodule.  Follow-up chest CT is recommended
 when clinically appropriate.
