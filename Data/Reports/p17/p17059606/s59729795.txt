                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with reactive airway disease, p/w cough,
 dyspnea and hypoxemia  // r/o consolidative process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the frontal and lateral images show
 more clearly than on the previous radiograph, a mild enlargement of the right
 hilar structures.  The lateral radiograph suggests that some of the hilar
 lymph nodes could be calcified.  No lung parenchymal changes.  No pleural
 effusions.  Normal size of the heart.
 The findings should be further worked up by a CT to rule out disease is
 associated with central lymphadenopathy, for example sarcoid.
