                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with cough for three days
 and low oxygen saturations and wheezing.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 multiple prior chest radiographs and CTs.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Enlargement of the right hilus is unchanged due to
 multiple calcified lymph nodes as well as presence of the calcified
 lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum.  Lungs are clear and there is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
