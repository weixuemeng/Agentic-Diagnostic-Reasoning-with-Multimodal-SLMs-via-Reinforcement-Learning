                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with multiple medical problems, new cough, decreased
 breath sound in the left base concerning for aspiration pneumonia infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are hard to compare because of different
 technique.  Left pleural effusion is moderate with compressive atelectasis. 
 Right pleural effusion is small more loculated posteriorly with right middle
 lobe partial collapse.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Very mild volume
 overload is also stable.  Right-sided PICC line ends in cavoatrial junction
 and dialysis catheter side ends in the lower atrium.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusion is more prominent on the left side with
 compressive atelectasis. Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded in appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Volume overload is minimal.
