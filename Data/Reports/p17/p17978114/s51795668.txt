                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is a Dobbhoff tube in place
 that has been pulled back slightly and lies within the upper stomach.  Right
 PICC line extends to almost the junction of the brachiocephalic and the
 superior vena cava.  There are continued low lung volumes.  Bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications could well reflect elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure, though the possibility of unilateral or even bilateral regions of
 consolidation would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
