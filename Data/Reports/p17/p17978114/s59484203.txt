                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bacteremia and abdominal distention.  Evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The left internal jugular central venous catheter is noted to
 terminate in the mid SVC.  A Dobbhoff tube is present with the tip overlying
 the stomach and the most proximal side port just below the hemidiaphragms. 
 There is no free air below the hemidiaphragms, although the exam is limited by
 semi-upright position and penetration.  The lung volumes are low.  Mild
 pulmonary edema has slightly worsened.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax, or new consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air below the hemidiaphragms, although the study is
 limited by technique.
 2.  Interval worsening of mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Unchanged Dobbhoff position within the stomach with the most proximal side
 port just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
