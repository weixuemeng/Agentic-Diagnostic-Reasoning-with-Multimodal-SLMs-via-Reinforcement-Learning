 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lightheadedness.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous

 Basilar opacities on the lateral view are most suggestive of atelectasis given
 low lung volumes.  Superiorly, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.  Surgical clips are seen in the upper
 abdomen.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
