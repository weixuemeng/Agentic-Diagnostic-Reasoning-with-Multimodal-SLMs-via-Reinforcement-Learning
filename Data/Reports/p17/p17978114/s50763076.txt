 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, septic shock, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Mild increase in extent and diameter of the
 pulmonary vasculature, potentially suggesting mild fluid overload.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumonia or pneumothorax.  The nasogastric tube has been
 removed in the interval.
