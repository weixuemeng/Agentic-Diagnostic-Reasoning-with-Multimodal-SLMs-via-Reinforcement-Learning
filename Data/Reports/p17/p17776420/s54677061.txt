                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia after, evaluate for pulmonary edema, aspiration
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for changes due to this, the
 cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.  The bilateral hila
 are unremarkable.  Mild diffuse prominence of the interstitium may relate to
 crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of a suboptimal
 inspiratory effort.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  There is no focal lobar consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
