                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST DATED ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours remain normal.  Patchy
 opacities have developed in both infrahilar regions, and could potentially
 represent aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia in the setting of
 fever and cough.  Patchy atelectasis is an additional consideration.  No
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
