                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Metallic
 spiral density projecting over the right mid to upper lateral lung field is
 seen on frontal view only and therefore is likely external to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
