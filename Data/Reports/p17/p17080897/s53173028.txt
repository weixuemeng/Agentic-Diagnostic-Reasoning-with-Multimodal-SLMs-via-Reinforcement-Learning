 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Intermittent chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 The aortic arch is partly calcified and mildly tortuous.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear clear.  There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  A prior right posterolateral sixth rib
 fracture is not visible on the prior study but appears old.  Surgical clips
 project about the region of the gastroesophageal junction, predominantly
 beneath the level of the left hemidiaphragm.  Mild degenerative changes appear
 similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Surgical clips
 projecting along the gastroesophageal junction.
