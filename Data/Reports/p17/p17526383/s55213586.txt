                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM
 
 Note is made that the new opacity in the left lower lobe is different from the
 known right lower lobe lung nodule that by itself needs a followup with CT.  
 Shallow obliques are recommended to evaluate the nodule in the left lower
 lobe.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Nodular opacity projecting in the
 retrocardiac region is new seen only in the frontal view, not visualized in
 the lateral view, otherwise, the lungs are clear.  No evidence of pneumonia,
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild degenerative changes are in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 Repeat PA and shallow obliques recommended to reevaluate the new nodular
 opacity.  This could be superimposition of normal structures or a lung nodule.
