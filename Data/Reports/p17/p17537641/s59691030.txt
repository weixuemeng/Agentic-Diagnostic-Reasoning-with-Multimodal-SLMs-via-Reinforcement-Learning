                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with alzheimer disease and one week of increasing
 agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged with a left ventricular
 predominance. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 otherwise unremarkable. Streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded. No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is present, and the right lung is clear.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis. Early infection is not
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
