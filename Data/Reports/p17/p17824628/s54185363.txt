                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cerebellar tumor resection  // new ___
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Abdominal portable radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two radiographs demonstrate descent of an enteric tube through the thorax an
 uncomplicated course.  Final images demonstrate the enteric tube its tip which
 projects over the left upper quadrant in the anticipated location of the
 gastric lumen.  Lung volumes are low with associated atelectasis at the bases.
 There is no large pleural effusion.  Opacity projecting over the right medial
 lung baselikely reflects bronchovascular crowding, less likely aspiration
 event.  There is no large pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Enteric tube projects in the anticipated location of the gastric lumen.  Low
 lung volumes with subsequent atelectasis.  Opacity projecting over the right
 medial lung base probably bronchovascular crowding although acute aspiration
 event is not entirely excluded.
