                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable,
 including borderline cardiomegaly and dextropositioning of the heart.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion.  Streaky left basilar opacities tenting the
 left hemidiaphragm suggest minor atelectasis.  Likewise, band-like opacity in
 the periphery of the left lateral lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.
 Central mid-to-lower lung opacities emanating from each hilum could be seen
 with fairly widespread pneumonia.  Although upper lungs are spared, pulmonary
 edema could also be considered.  In addition to correlation with clinical
 presentation, short-term follow-up radiographs are suggested.
