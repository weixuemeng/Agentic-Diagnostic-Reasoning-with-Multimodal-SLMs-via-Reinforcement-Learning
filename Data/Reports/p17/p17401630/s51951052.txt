                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with lap band and abdominal pain mostly in left
 lower quadrant, on steroids.  Question microperforation or free air under the
 diaphragm.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___.
 Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam.  Hazy bibasilar opacities are
 seen and are most likely due to overlying soft tissues as opposed to
 parenchymal consolidation or effusion.  The cardiac silhouette appears
 enlarged and likely accentuated due to AP technique and lower inspiratory
 effort.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  No definite free air seen
 below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on this limited
 exam.  No free air below the diaphragm.
