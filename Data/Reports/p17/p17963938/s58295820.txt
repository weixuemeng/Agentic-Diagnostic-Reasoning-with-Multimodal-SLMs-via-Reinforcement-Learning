 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small-to-moderate left pneumothorax is again demonstrated with left
 chest tube and pigtail pleural catheter in place.  Overall, the basilar
 component of the pneumothorax appears slightly smaller.  Note is also made of
 improved aeration in the left lung base.  Right-sided pleural and parenchymal
 abnormalities were unchanged.
