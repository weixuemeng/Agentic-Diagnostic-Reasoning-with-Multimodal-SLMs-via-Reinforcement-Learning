                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with left pneumothorax, status post
 two chest tubes placement, now chest tube to waterseal, evaluate for interval
 reaccumulation of pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  Position of
 tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular vein approach central venous line
 unchanged.  The same holds for the left-sided chest tube terminating in the
 upper portion of the left-sided hemithorax at level of the anterior third rib.
 Also, the left-sided small pigtail drainage catheter on the left base remains
 in place.  Aeration of both lungs appears unchanged.  Again noticed is a small
 sized separation of the left-sided pleural space in the apical area of the
 same magnitude as it existed on the portable chest examination 10 hours ago. 
 Thus, as there is no interval change between those two radiographs, this
 situation is stable without evidence of increasing pneumothorax.
