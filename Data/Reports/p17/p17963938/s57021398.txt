                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with history of left rib fracture and
 pneumothorax status post chest tube placement, for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from same day from 4:39 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube remains stable in the trachea.  Right internal
 jugular catheter remains in the lower SVC.  Left-sided chest tube and left
 basal pigtail catheter are again visualized in unchanged position.  Again
 visualized is a small left apical pneumothorax, which appears stable in size. 
 Rightward shift of normally midline structures again noted but difficult to
 compare due to differences in rotation.  The cardiac silhouette appears
 stable.  Again visualized are stable right upper lobe, right lower lobe and
 lingular opacities as well as a small right pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little change in comparison to prior study from earlier in the same day with
 stable small left apical pneumothorax with a left-sided chest tube and left
 pigtail catheter in place as well as persistent multifocal lung opacities.
