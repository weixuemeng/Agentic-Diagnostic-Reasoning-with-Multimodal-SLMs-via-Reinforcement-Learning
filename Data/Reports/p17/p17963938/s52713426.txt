                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A ___-year-old intubated with chest tube position,
 question leak.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:27.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tracheostomy tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  Two right subclavian PICC lines are seen, one with the tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction and the other of which is in the
 proximal subclavian vein.  Left chest tube is unchanged in position.  There
 has been interval decrease in the amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the
 left lateral chest wall.  There is a small residual but stable left apical
 pneumothorax.  There is increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity,
 which suggests superimposed component of mild interstitial edema.  Probable
 small layering bilateral effusions.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable given differences in patient positioning.  The mid clavicular
 fracture and fracture of the left second anterior rib is again noted.  The
 other described fractures of the left third and fourth anterior ribs and a
 nondisplaced fracture of the sternum are not appreciated on the plain film
 study.
