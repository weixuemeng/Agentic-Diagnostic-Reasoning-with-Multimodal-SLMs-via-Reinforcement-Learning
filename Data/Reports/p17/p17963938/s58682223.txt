                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:25 A.M.  ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Patient intubated, question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient is consistently rotated to the right increasing the radiodensity of
 the left hemithorax but nevertheless there looks to be widespread edema and
 possibly moderate left pleural effusion.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Extensive right pleural thickening is presumably tumor extension
 or hemothorax.
 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in the upper
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Left clavicle and multiple left rib fractures noted.
