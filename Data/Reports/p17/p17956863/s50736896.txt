                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with dyspnea  // eval for pleural effusions, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   An epicardial fat pad likely
 accounts for the subtle opacity abutting the left heart border. The lung
 volumes are somewhat low. There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or
 overt CHF. There is mild blunting of the right CP angle which could represent
 a tiny effusion. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible tiny right pleural effusion. Otherwise unremarkable.
