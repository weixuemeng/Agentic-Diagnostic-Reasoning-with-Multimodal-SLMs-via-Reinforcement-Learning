                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Syncope, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is increased opacification at the left lung base silhouetting
 the left hemidiaphragm with associated blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 reflecting a left pleural effusion with associated lung collapse and/or focal
 consolidation in the appropriate clinical context.  These findings are new
 from the most recent prior study of ___.  Diffuse interstitial lung
 markings with scarring at the bilateral apices are unchanged.  No significant
 right pleural effusion is detected.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  The
 pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  The trachea is midline.
