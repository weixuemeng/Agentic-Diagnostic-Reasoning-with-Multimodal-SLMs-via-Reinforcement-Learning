                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Declining mental status and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 mild diffuse interstitial abnormality is unchanged in the background.  The
 main change is that there is new mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 streaky retrocardiac opacities.  It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions,
 although none are definitively shown.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe with mild volume
 loss.  Although the appearance could potentially be explained by atelectasis,
 pneumonia or aspiration could be considered for this appearance and short-term
 followup radiographs, preferably with PA and lateral technique, may be helpful
 to assess further if clinically indicated.
