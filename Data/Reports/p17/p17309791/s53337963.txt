                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the outside image of the same date, there is
 little change.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs raising the possibility
 of some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is seen.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary markings could reflect
 mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or a
 combination of both.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
