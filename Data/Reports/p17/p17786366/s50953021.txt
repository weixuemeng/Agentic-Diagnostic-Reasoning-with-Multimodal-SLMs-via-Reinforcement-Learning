                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with COPD, dyspnea, evaluate for consolidation or
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate diffuse bilateral
 interstitial fibrosis and cystic changes.  There is no focal airspace
 consolidation.  Heart is mildly enlarged and cardiomediastinal contour is
 notable for a tortuous thoracic aorta and a very prominent right hilus
 suggesting an enlarged pulmonary artery or lymphadenopathy.  Lung volumes are
 low.  There is a rounded lucency at the right lung apex, likely representing a
 bulla.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal consolidation or evidence of pulmonary edema.
 2.  Severe interstitial lung disease / fibrosis.
 3.  Very prominent right hilus likely reflecting an enlarged pulmonary artery
 or presence of lymphadenopathy.
