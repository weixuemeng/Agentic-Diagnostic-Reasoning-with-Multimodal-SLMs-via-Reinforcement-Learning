                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post spinal fusion with fevers. 
 Evaluate for infection or atelectasis.
 
 No comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can be
 helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest, ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given AP
 technique.  Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace
 consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No acute
 bony abnormality is appreciated.  A 3 to 4 mm linear radiopaque abnormality is
 seen overlying the inferior edge of the left sixth lateral rib projects in the
 midline on the lateral view with a second linear opacity on the lateral
 projection as well.  The imaging appearance is suggestive of surgical clips. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Comparison to remote studies also would be
 helpful.
