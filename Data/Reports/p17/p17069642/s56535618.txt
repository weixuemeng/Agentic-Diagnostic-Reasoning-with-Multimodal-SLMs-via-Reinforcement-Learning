                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, CTA chest
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed. Median sternotomy
 wires and CABG clips are again noted. The heart size is top normal.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions. The lungs are hyperinflated with an
 enlarged retrosternal air space, consistent with COPD. A new streaky opacity
 at the right base is new and may represent pneumonia. Peribronchial opacities
 are also noted. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may indicate mild
 edema, which is improved since the prior study. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible right lower pneumonia or recent aspiration. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
