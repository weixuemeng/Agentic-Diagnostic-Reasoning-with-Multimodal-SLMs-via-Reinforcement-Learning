                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with respiratory distress.  Evaluate
 for possible postoperative aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA
 and lateral chest examination of ___.  On today's examination,
 the patient is moderately rotated towards the right which results in a
 somewhat different projection of the previously identified sternotomy wires
 and the cardiovascular and mediastinal silhouettes.  Grossly, the findings are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of new acute
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral pleural sinuses remain
 free from any fluid accumulation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No gross interval change is identified on this portable single
 view examination in comparison with the previous PA and lateral chest
 examination of ___.  Thus, there is evidence of previous bypass
 surgery with borderline heart size but no evidence of acute infiltrates or
 congestion. As before general findings consistent with COPD.
