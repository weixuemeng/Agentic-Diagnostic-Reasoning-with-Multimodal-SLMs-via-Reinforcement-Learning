                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.  There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral
 pleural effusions not present on prior radiograph.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 unchanged. Patchy right upper lung opacity may relate to pulmonary edema, but
 an underlying consolidation due to infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. No pneumothorax.  Again noted is a sclerotic
 density adjacent to the left coracoid process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Patchy right upper lung opacity may relate to pulmonary edema, but
 an underlying consolidation due to infection is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
