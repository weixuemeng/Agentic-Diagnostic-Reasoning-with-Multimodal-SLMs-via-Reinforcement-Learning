 The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged.  The

 in the left lung base compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities are seen.  Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
 again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subsegmental left basilar atelectasis.  Otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
