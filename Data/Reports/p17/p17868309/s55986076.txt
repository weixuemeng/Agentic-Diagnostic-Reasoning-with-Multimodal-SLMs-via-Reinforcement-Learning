                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with astrocytoma that ? aspirated.  Evaluate for acute
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of the chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion to suggest
 aspiration.  Linear opacities in the right lung base represent peripheral
 atelectasis and are new from comparison exam.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Tortuosity of the aorta is again noted.  Dextroscoliosis of thoracic spine is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Peripheral plate-like atelectasis in the right lower lung is new.
 No focal opacities are present to suggest aspiration; however, aspiration
 cannot be completely excluded on the basis of single frontal radiograph of the
 chest.
