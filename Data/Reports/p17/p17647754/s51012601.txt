                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of malaise for three
 weeks.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The patient
 is rotated to the right.  Bilateral spinal rods are again seen, grossly
 stable.  Left base atelectasis is seen, early consolidation is difficult to
 exclude, but felt unlikely.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is minimal right apical pleural thickening.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild left base atelectasis, early consolidation is difficult to
 exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, but is otherwise felt unlikely. 
 Besides the above, no significant interval change since the prior study given
 differences in patient position.
