                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CHF, dyspnea. Evaluate for pleural effusion or pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left-sided single lead pacemaker appears in adequate position with the lead
 terminating in the right ventricle. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 Bilateral pleural effusions, however difficult to evaluate due to overlying
 soft tissues. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema.  Infectious process in the lung
 bases can be obscured by the edema.  Re-assessment after diuresis is required
