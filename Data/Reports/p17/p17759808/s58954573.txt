                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Seizure versus syncope for two episodes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead
 extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis.  Subtle prominence of the central vessels of the
 chest may be a component of mild central vascular engorgement, although this
 is similar to prior.  Degenerative changes are seen along the spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis with possible mild central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  No significant interval change.
