                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: A single lead pacemaker device again terminates in the right
 ventricle.  The heart appears mild to moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  Each hilum appears mildly engorged but it is not necessarily clear
 that this would represent a clinically significant acute finding.  Minimal
 retrocardiac opacification is typical for atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute process.  If pulmonary symptoms are present,
 however, then short-term followup radiographs may be helpful.
