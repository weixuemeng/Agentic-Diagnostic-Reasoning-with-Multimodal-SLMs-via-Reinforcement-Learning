                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, please evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate bilateral patchy
 opacities in a perihilar distribution in addition to prominence of the
 pulmonary vasculature likely indicating interstitial pulmonary edema.  Minimal
 linear opacities in bibasilar lungs likely represent atelectasis, slightly
 improved compared to next preceding study.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.  There is an unchanged single-lead pacemaker with tip
 positioned in the right ventricle. Minimal degenerative changes are identified
 in the bilateral AC joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
