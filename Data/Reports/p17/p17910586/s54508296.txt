                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pmhx of CHF, COPD and multiple recent
 admissions for BI-P for MRSA pna who presents with SOB  // eval for pulmonary
 edema, pna
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior film and allowing for differences in technique, there
 may be a new small left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, I doubt significant
 interval change.
 
 Again seen is background COPD, with cardiomegaly, CHF with interstitial and
 alveolar edema, an slight elevation left hemidiaphragm.  Patchy opacity in the
 right infrahilar region is also again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema is similar to the prior study.  The
 presence of bibasilar infectious infiltrates would be difficult to exclude in
 this setting. Possible small new left pleural effusion.
