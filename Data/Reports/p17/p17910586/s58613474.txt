  1. Mild vascular congestion. 2. Hyperexpanded lungs can be seen in setting of
  small airways disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Right mid
  hemi thorax heterogeneous peripheral opacity is better characterized on CT
  chest performed on same day.  Differential includes atelectasis and pulmonary
  infarct given history of pulmonary embolism. 4.  Right lower lobe atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PE from ___.  Assess for pleural effusion,
 infiltrate, pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest with contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are again noted to be mildly hyperexpanded with mild vascular
 congestion.  Streaky opacities within the right lower lobe are most consistent
 with atelectasis.  Heterogeneous peripheral opacity within the right mid hemi
 thorax is new since prior examination and better assessed on dedicated CT
 performed the same day.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are present.  The heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged since
 ___.  Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild vascular congestion.
 2.  Hyperexpanded lungs can be seen in setting of small airways disease and
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 3.  Right mid hemi thorax heterogeneous peripheral opacity is better
 characterized on CT chest performed on same day.  Differential includes
 atelectasis and pulmonary infarct given history of pulmonary embolism.
 4.  Right lower lobe atelectasis.
