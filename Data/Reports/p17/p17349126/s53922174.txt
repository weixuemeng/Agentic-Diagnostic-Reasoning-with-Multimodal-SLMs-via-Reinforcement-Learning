                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with spinal cord injury.  Difficulty weaning
 ventilation. 
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved.  Bibasilar opacities larger on the left
 side are stable consistent with atelectasis.  There is probably a small left
 effusion.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged position .  The NG tube tip is not
 well visualized.  Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries consistent with
 pulmonary hypertension is again noted.
