 Comparison is made with prior study performed a same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild pulmonary edema has improved.
 Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side are stable, consistent with
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube tip is in standard position. 
 NG tube tip is not well visualized and appears to be below the diaphragm. 
 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT from ___.  The
 main pulmonary arteries are enlarged as before suggesting pulmonary
 hypertension.
