                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  T11 fracture and low blood pressure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 8.3 cm from the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the distal esophagus, though the tip
 appears to be off the inferior borders of the film.  Right internal jugular
 central venous catheter tip likely at the junction the right internal jugular
 and subclavian veins.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  There is
 moderate to severe pulmonary edema with fluid noted in the right minor
 fissure.  Costophrenic angles are excluded from the field of view bilaterally.
 No large pneumothorax however is identified.  Known fracture of the T11
 vertebral body is not well seen on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube in standard position.  Nasogastric tube courses into the
 distal esophagus, with the tip likely off the inferior borders of the film. 
 Confirmation of the tip of the nasogastric tube can be obtained with a view of
 the lower chest and upper abdomen.  
 
 3. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip likely at the junction
 of the right subclavian and internal jugular veins.
