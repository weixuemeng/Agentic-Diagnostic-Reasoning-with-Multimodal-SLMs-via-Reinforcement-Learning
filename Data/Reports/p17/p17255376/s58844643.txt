                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chronic cough for three months.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is substantially increased in a global fashion, with
 lucency on the lateral view suspicious for epicardial fat surrounded by
 pericardial effusion that might explain the increased cardiac silhouette. 
 Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Correlation with echocardiography for assessment of suspected pericardial
 effusion and cardiac chambers is necessary.
