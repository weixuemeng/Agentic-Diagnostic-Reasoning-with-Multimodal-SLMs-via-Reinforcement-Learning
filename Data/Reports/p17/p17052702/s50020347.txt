                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Post-surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  There is increased opacification at the left base with
 obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and left pleural effusion.  Less prominent changes are seen on the
 right.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
