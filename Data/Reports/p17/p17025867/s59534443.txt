                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with likely pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and PA and lateral chest radiographs
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacities previously seen in the right upper lobe have worsened. 
 Two new opacities seen in the left middle lung zone and right lower lung zone
 are suspicious for pneumonia.  These areas of opacity appear to be confluences
 of smaller nodular opacities which could also represent septic emboli. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The pleural surfaces are
 unremarkable.  No pleural effusions are observed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacities in the right upper and lower lung zone and left mid
 lung zone concerning for pneumonia.  Given their nodular appearance septic
 emboli should also be considered.
