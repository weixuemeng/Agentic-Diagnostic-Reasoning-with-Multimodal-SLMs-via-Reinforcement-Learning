                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with medical history CAD s/p PCI to RCA in ___ and DM, who
 initially presented with CP in setting of an NSTEMI, transferred to ___ for
 cardiac cath, course complicated by flash pulmonary edema and hypoxemic
 respiratory failure requiring intubation as well as undifferentiated shock
 requiring IABP and pressor support, admitted to CCU for further management  //
 ? IABP placement  ? IABP placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Intra-aortic pump balloon still ends close to the apex of the aortic arch,
 approximately 3 cm above standard placement.  Ascending Swan-Ganz catheter
 ends in the left pulmonary artery, unchanged.  Given lower lung volumes,
 moderate pulmonary edema has probably not worsened, although mediastinal veins
 are probably more distended.  Cardiac ___ are normal. Pleural effusions
 are presumed, but not large.  No pneumothorax.
