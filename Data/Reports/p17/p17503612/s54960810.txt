                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fevers.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral upright chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral
 hilar prominence, likely secondary to low lung volumes.  There is a small
 right pleural effusion and a probable focus of airspace abnormality in the
 lower lung, favoring the right side.  The cardiac silhouette, and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Low lung volumes, with a small right pleural effusion and lower lung airspace
 abnormality.  The side of abnormality could be better determined with
 bilateral oblique views.
 
 Recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ at 11:00AM by phone.
