                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with history of respiratory failure, alcohol
 withdrawal  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present.  The tip lies at the mid
 clavicular heads, 4.4 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip
 overlying gastric fundus.  The sideport not well visualized, but may lie above
 the level of the GE junction.
 
 Allowing for positioning, mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 with prominence of the right paratracheal venous vasculature, is probably
 unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.  No focal
 infiltrate or effusion is detected.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described, with NG tube sideport noted above the GE
 junction.
 
 Doubt significant interval change.  No CHF or focal infiltrate identified.
