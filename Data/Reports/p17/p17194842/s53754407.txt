                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxia after fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low. The heart is probably enlarged to a mild extent. The
 left lung base is opacified, involving basilar left lower lobe and lingular
 consolidations or extensive atelectasis with patchy appearance and possibly a
 pleural effusion. There is a small pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar opacification.  This appearance could be seen with atelectasis or
 pneumonia, potentially with pleural effusion.  Ribs are not well delineated
 owing to background opacification.
