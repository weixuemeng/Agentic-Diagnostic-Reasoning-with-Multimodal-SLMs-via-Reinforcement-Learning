                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from PET-CT performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is increasing opacification of the right hemithorax which suggests
 primarily an increase in a pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. 
 There is neutral to perhaps mild rightward shift.  The left lung remains
 clear.  There is no pleural effusion on the left.  A Port-A-Cath terminates in
 the superior vena cava.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing opacification of the right hemithorax suggesting for the most part
 an increasing pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, although not
 otherwise assessed in detail with radiography.
