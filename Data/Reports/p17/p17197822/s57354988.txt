                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female found unresponsive, status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates at the carina.  There is a
 moderate-sized left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar opacification.
 No right pleural effusion is detected on this view.  No pneumothorax is
 evident on this view.  No focal consolidation is seen in the right lung.  The
 aorta is calcified.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, but pulmonary
 vascularity is slightly prominent and cephalized, possibly secondary to supine
 positioning. Old right sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip at the carina.  Retracting 3-cm is recommended.
 
 2.  Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left basilar opacification,
 possibly reflecting atelectasis; underlying infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by ___
 ___ by telephone at 9:40 a.m. on ___ 8 minutes after discovery of these
 findings.
