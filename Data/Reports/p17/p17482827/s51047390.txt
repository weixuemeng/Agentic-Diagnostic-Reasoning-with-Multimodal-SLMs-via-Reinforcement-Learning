                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hip fx s/p ORIF and leukocytosis of
 unknown etiology  // concern for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest x-ray obtained ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unchanged in comparison to
 prior film.  There is again seen a calcified thoracic aorta.  The bilateral
 hila are normal.
 
 There has been interval development of a left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity,
 possibly with a visualized air bronchogram, which obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm. Additionally, there is loss of definition of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. This may
 represent new left lower lobe or possibly bilateral lower lobe aspiration
 versus pneumonia, especially given clinical context. This appearance could
 also simply represent bibasilar relaxation atelectasis secondary to small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 There are no pneumothoraces.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity, as well as right lower lobe
 opacification, which is concerning for left lower lobe versus bilateral lower
 lobe aspiration or pneumonia. Less likely, may also represent bibasilar
 atelectasis secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were discussed over the phone by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ on ___ at 14:40, approximately 15 minutes after
 discovery.
