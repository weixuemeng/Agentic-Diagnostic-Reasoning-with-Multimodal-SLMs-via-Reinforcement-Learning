 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:   ___M with cough  // ?pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph: ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low, accentuating the heart size, with which is
 persistently mildly enlarged.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary
 vasculature, with peribronchial cuffing and vascular cephalization.  No focal
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia is detected.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Right upper quadrant cholecystectomy clips are seen.  On the first lateral
 view, metallic foreign bodies project over the anterior upper abdomen,
 compatible with keys.  These were subsequently removed on the second lateral
 projection.  Mild anterior wedging of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary edema.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.
