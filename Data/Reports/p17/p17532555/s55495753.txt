                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Again,
 the globular configuration of the heart raises the possibility of underlying
 pericardial effusion.  A more focal opacification at the right base is not
 appreciated at this time.
