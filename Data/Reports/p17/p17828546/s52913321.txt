                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Anasarca with prior cancer history, evaluate for heart failure.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There is no focal airspace consolidation
 to suggest pneumonia.  Hazy, rounded opacity seen in the right mid lung, best
 appreciated on the frontal view, is not fully evaluated on this study.  The
 heart size and mediastinum are normal.  There is no large pleural effusion.  A
 left nephrostomy tube is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intrathoracic process.
 2.  Right mid lung rounded opacity not fully evaluated on this study.  While
 this may represent overlying structure, comparison with prior films or follow
 up with a non-emergent high-resolution chest CT is recommended.
