                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and has increased in size
 since the prior study.  This is accompanied by new pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, peribronchial cuffing and vascular indistinctness.  Also new is a
 confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region with a few air
 bronchograms, accompanied by a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Focal
 area of scarring in the right mid lung appears unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
 2.  Left lower lobe opacity, which could be due to either atelectasis or
 infectious pneumonia, accompanied by a small-to-moderate pleural effusion.
