                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with parkinsons who failed swallow study today  //
 aspiration pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads in unchanged positions terminating
 in the regions of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears moderately enlarged but similar.  Bilateral
 hilar enlargement is compatible with pulmonary arterial enlargement, as seen
 previously.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Bilateral calcified
 pleural plaques are re- demonstrated.  Focal opacity within the left apex is
 re- demonstrated, and remains concerning for pneumonia.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected. 
 Marked degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints
 are re- demonstrated.  Additionally, moderate degenerative changes are again
 noted in the thoracic spine with bridging anterior osteophytes compatible with
 DISH.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No substantial interval change from the previous CT examination with
 persistent pneumonia in the left upper lobe.
 2. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques indicative of prior asbestos exposure.
 3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
