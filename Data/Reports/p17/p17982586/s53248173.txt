 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic right effusion and right PTX s/p
 chest tube placement with 700mL fluid removed  // ? residual PTX or effusion  
 ? residual PTX or effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change
 in the degree of right pneumothorax. Thoracentesis has apparently decreased
 the amount of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax, though there now appears
 to be a small loculated area of pneumothorax in the in for pulmonary region.
 Left lung is unchanged.
