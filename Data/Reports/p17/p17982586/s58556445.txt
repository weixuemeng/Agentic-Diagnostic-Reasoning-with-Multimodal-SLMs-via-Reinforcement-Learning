                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with right apical PTX and pleural effusion s/p
 chest tube clamping. please schedule CXR for 3pm on ___  // eval for interval
 change in pleural effusion and PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest chest x-ray from ___ at 09:44
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. Again
 seen is a small right apical pneumothorax as well as a probable small
 loculated pneumothorax at the right lung base. Allowing for technical
 differences, the pneumothoraces do not appear significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided pneumothoraces, without significant change compared with earlier
 the same day.
