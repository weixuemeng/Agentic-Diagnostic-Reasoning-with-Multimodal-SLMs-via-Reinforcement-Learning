                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 
 CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o with PMHx significant for sCHF (EF ___% in ___), afib
 s/p AV nodal ablation with BiV PM, HTN, HLD, recent URI versus strep throat
 illness complicated by persistent cough x 4 weeks, who was found to have a
 moderate right-sided PTX on CXR now s/p chest tube placement ___.  // Assess
 for interval change in PTX, effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a chest tube at the right lung base. Previously seen kink at the
 chest wall is no longer visualized. The right apical pneumothorax remains
 visible, though it has decreased slightly in size. Scarring and probable
 loculated pneumothorax at the right lung base is again noted. There is new
 minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which could reflect a small
 amount of pleural fluid and new trace blunting of left costophrenic angle. No
 CHF. No new infiltrate identified.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right apical pneumothorax remains present, but is slightly decreased in
 size.
 2. New small right pleural effusion and trace blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle. No CHF.
