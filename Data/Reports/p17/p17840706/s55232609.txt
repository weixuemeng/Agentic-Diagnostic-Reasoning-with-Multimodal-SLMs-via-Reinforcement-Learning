                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated with OG tube, assess tube position.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 6:53 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. 
 An NG or OG type tube is present.  The tip extends beneath the diaphragm and
 overlies the gastric fundus.  The side port lies at the very upper medial edge
 of the gastric fundus, likely just beyond the GE junction.  
 
 Background COPD, cardiomegaly, vascular plethora, and bibasilar atelectasis
 are similar to the earlier film. Focal opacity in the right cardiophrenic
 region could reflect some pleural fluid and/or parenchymal opacity.
