                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath with crackles in
 the right anterior lung field, rule out abnormalities.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest, ___ at ___ are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 The left-sided AICD with its three leads remains in place and unchanged in
 position.  The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable, although
 the heart remains mildly enlarged.  The lungs are hyperinflated but overall,
 the lungs volumes appear slightly diminished since ___ and there is an
 increasing interstitial prominence along with stable, streaky linear opacities
 in the left base which may represent an area of bronchiectasis with associated
 scarring.  The increasing interstitial prominence does raise concern for mild
 interstitial edema superimposed on underlying emphysema, a superimposed
 interstitial pneumonia or underlying interstitial disease.  If these are of
 clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful.  A wet
 reading was provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 6:___ p.m. by
 phone.  No pneumothorax.  Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may
 represent tiny effusions versus pleural thickening.  Calcification of the
 aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. Slight prominence of the
 pulmonary arteries may suggest a component of underlying pulmonary arterial
 hypertension.  Radiopaque material projecting over one of the lower thoracic
 vertebrae is consistent with prior vertebroplasty.
