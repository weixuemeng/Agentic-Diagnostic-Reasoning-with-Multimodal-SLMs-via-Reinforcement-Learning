                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subclavian access for ICD, evaluate for pneumothorax or hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The ICD generator is seen overlying the left chest wall with three leads
 attached, one in the expected location of the right atrium and two in the
 expected location of the right ventricle, one of which is new from prior exam.
 One of the leads has been disconnected from the generator, presumably the one
 being replaced.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.  There is
 stable mild cardiomegaly.  There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New ICD lead in the expected location of the right ventricle with no evidence
 of complication, particularly no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
