                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fever, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy
 ill-defined opacity is noted within the right lower lobe, which could reflect
 an area of developing infection.  Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base
 is also noted, possibly an area of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right lower lobe ill-defined opacity is concerning for an area of
 developing infection.
