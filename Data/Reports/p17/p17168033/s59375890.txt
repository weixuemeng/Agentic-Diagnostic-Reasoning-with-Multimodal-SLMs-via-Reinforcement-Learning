                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with POEMS syndrome and acute respiratory failure. 
 Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates interval improvement in
 aeration.  Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in the interim.  There
 is scattered subsegmental atelectasis.  A rounded opacity in the right mid
 lung is likely loculated pleural fluid.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged, the mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is
 unchanged.
 
 
 The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies 4 cm from the
 level of the carina.  An NG tube is in place, the tip is not seen.  A right
 chest port is unchanged in position, the tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in aeration, and decrease in size of bilateral pleural
 effusions, with remnant loculated pleural effusion in the right mid lung.
