                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stem cell transplant with increasing hypoxia, to assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 that may account for much of the increased prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular
 congestion.  However, there is increased opacification at the bases, more
 prominent on the left, that most likely reflects pleural effusion and
 underlying atelectasis.
 
 Central catheter tip again extends to about the level of the cavoatrial
 junction.
