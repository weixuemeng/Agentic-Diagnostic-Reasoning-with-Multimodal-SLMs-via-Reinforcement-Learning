                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 Examination was obtained solely for placement of a Dobbhoff tube and is
 sufficient for this purpose.  It excludes the portion of the periphery of the
 left hemithorax.
 
 A newly placed Dobbhoff tube terminates within the distal stomach.  Within the
 chest, an asymmetrical pattern of airspace consolidation involving the left
 lung to a greater degree than the right appears slightly improved, and is
 likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion is
 unchanged, and left effusion cannot be assessed due to technical limitations
 of the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Feeding tube terminates in distal stomach.
