                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Febrile neutropenia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung
 volumes, which may account for much of the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.  
 
 Central catheter position is unchanged.
