 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with POEMS syndrome extubated now with new
 hemoptysis.  Evaluate for cause of hemoptysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from ___.  A
 right-sided central line has the distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction,
 unchanged from prior.  There is improvement in the loculated pleural effusion
 in the right mid lung field since the prior study.  However, there is a new
 area of consolidation within the left upper lobe.  There is also some
 increased consolidation within the right perihilar region.  These may
 represent areas of pneumonia.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.
