 WET READ: ___ ___ ___:___ PM
  Perhaps some minimal improvement in consolidative opacity in the right upper
  lobe compared to yesterday.  Otherwise unchanged multifocal pneumonia.
  Apparent increase in size of left pleural effusion may be secondary to supine
  positioning.  ETT no less than 4.7 cm above carina.  OGT and right subclavian
  lines unchanged.  No pneumothorax. -___ ___

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ICU, respiratory distress, questionable intrapulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the right
 central venous access line are unchanged.  The parenchymal opacities on the
 right are constant.  On the left, there is still a small pleural effusion. 
 However, in the left apex, the density of the lung parenchyma has slightly
 increased, likely reflecting decreased ventilation or newly appeared subtle
 parenchymal opacities.
 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
