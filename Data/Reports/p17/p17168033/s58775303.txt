                                 FINAL REPORT
 CXR PORTABLE FILM TAKEN AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Progression of pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse hazy airspace process consistent with pulmonary
 edema.  Small right pleural effusion noted.  Left costophrenic angle has not
 been included on the film.  Right subclavian catheter tip lies in the upper
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax identified.  Prominence of the
 mediastinum/central structures is partly due to magnification and partly due
 to CHF.
