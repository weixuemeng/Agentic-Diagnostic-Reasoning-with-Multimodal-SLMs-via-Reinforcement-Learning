 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Right central venous line tip is at
 the cavoatrial junction.  Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of

 Slight narrowing of the upper trachea is demonstrated that might be related to
