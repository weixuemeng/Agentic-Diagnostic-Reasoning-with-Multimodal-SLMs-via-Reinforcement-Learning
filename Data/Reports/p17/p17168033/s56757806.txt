                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, intubation, evaluation for tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects 4 cm above the carina.  There
 is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The right
 Port-A-Cath is in correct position.
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with areas of atelectasis and unchanged
 perihilar right opacity, likely caused by mild fluid overload.
