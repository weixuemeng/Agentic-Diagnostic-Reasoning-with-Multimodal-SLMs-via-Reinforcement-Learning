 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions are minimally decreased on the right.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  Opacities in the left mid lung are a combination
 of atelectasis and fluid in the fissure.  Right perihilar opacities are also a
 combination of atelectasis and fluid in the fissure.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Cardiomegaly cannot be evaluated.  It is obscured by the parenchymal
 abnormalities.  Central line tip is in the lower SVC.
