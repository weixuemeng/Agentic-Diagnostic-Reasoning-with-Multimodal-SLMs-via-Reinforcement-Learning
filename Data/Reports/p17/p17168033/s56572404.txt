                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 14:45
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with POEMS, alveolar hemorrhage.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 21:01
 and 12:10 p.m.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 14:45 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given
 differences in patient positioning and rotation.  There is diffuse bilateral
 airspace process which when compared to ___ has improved suggesting a
 component of resolving edema superimposed on the alveolar hemorrhage.  There
 is still more consolidative opacity at both bases.  There are likely small
 pleural effusions.  A right subclavian catheter remains in place with its tip
 near the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Aorta seems somewhat
 unfolded and tortuous.
