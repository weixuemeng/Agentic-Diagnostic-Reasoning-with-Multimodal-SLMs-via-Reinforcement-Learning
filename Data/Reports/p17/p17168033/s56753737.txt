                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS and pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly better
 lung volumes.  However, there is still enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with some
 combination of widespread pneumonia and ARDS.  Some element of elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure may be present and there are bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
