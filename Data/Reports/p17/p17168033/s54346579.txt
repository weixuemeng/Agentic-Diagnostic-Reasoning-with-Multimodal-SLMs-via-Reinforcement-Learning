                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 11:48 P.M. ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with acute respiratory distress.  Suspect aspiration
 and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Transient improvement in the diffuse severe consolidative pulmonary
 abnormality which recurred between ___ and ___ have reversed
 slightly, although to some extent the greater opacification in both lungs
 could be due to lower lung volumes.  Nevertheless, this raises possibility of
 superimposition of a component of hydrostatic edema or a developing diffuse
 alveolar damage.  The global nature of the abnormality argues against
 worsening of concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  Heart size is indeterminate.  Feeding tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right subclavian line ends close if
 not beyond the superior cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.  Right PIC line
 can be traced as far as the lower margin of the clavicle.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone.
