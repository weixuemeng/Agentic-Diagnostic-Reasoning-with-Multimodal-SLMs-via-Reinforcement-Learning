                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Confusion, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the subclavian catheter has
 been removed.  Continued low lung volumes.  Opacification at the bases most
 likely reflects either atelectasis or some crowding of pulmonary vessels.  No
 discrete acute pneumonia.
 
 There is a slight impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea. 
 This could reflect an underlying thyroid mass.
