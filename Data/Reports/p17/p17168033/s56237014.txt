                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is interval progression of widespread parenchymal consolidation that
 might represent interval development of ARDS or progression of infectious
 process.  The more peripheral location of the findings makes pulmonary edema
 interval development less likely.  Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely
 present.  The heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged since the prior
 study as well as the position of the ET tube, NG tube, and right subclavian
 line.
