                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube advancement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from seven hours earlier.
 
 There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.5 cm above the carina,
 appropriately sited.  There is a feeding tube whose distal tip and sideport
 are below the gastroesophageal junction.  There is cardiomegaly.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There is also increased
 density within the right mid lung zone, which may represent focal effusion
 versus developing infiltrate.  This is stable.  There are no pneumothoraces. 
 The right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.
