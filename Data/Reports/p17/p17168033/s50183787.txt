                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist and the
 monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Again this could reflect
 diffuse pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS.
