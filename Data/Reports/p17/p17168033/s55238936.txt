 tip is not well seen, but appears to be distal to the GE junction.  There is
 cardiomegaly which is stable.  There is a left retrocardiac opacity and
 bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right.  Area of increased
 density at the right mid lung zone may represent developing infiltrate.  No
