                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Aspiration versus pneumonia.  The patient with POEMS, MDS, fever and
 hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  Similar to somewhat increased opacification of the left lung base
 reflecting parenchymal opacification with a pleural effusion.  Differential
 considerations include scarring or atelectasis, but pneumonia is hard to
 exclude.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  A
 Port-a-Cath terminates at the lower superior vena cava before.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar to increased left basilar opacification, probably
 reflecting pleural effusion and atelectasis, although findings are not
 entirely specific.
