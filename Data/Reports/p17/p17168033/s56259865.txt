 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the low lung volumes.  Widened mediastinum
 is due to engorgement of the vessels.  The main pulmonary arteries are
 enlarged as before.  There are low lung volumes.  Right central catheter tip
 is at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  NG tube tip is out
 of view below the diaphragm.  Multifocal lobar consolidations that are
 bilateral have improved in the left lower lobe, still greater in the right
 lung.  The multifocal consolidations are located in all lobes, better seen in
