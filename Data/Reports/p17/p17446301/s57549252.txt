                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumothorax or pneumonia in a patient status post
 laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication/paraesophageal hernia repair, who now
 presents with back pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  Lung volumes are slightly decreased, with bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is remarkable only for radiodense contrast material
 throughout the colon, likely related to leak check from ___.  A
 small amount of subcutaneous air is also likely related to the recent
 procedure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
 2. Small right pleural effusion and slightly low lung volumes with bibasilar
 atelectasis.
