                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p L VATS mediastinal LN Bx  // check interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there has been resolution
 of a left apical pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.  The cardiac shadow has
 decreased in size.    The left heart border is vague, likely secondary to a
 previously seen prevascular or anterior pleural fluid collection.  Compared
 with prior radiograph, air has been resorbed from the fluid collection, and
 the overall volume of the fluid collection is probably smaller.  There is no
 new consolidation or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval resolution of a left apical pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum
 compared with prior.  The prevascular mediastinal or anterior pleural fluid
 collection is probably decreased in size.
