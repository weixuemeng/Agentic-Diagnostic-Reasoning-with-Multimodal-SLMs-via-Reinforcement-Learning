                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes.  There
 is no pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  The left hilus
 is mildly enlarged but as an isolated finding is unlikely to be clinically
 significant, unless there is good evidence for acute pulmonary embolism.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild vascular enlargement, left hilus, should be evaluated in clinical context
 to consider acute pulmonary embolus, as discussed with Dr ___ ___
 reported a normal D-dimer level, excluding pulmonary embolus.
