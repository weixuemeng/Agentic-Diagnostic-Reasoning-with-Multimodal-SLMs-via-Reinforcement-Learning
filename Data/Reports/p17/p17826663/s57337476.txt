                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Progressive left upper quadrant pain, worse after eating.  Question
 perforated viscus.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  There is a small convexity at the
 expected site of the left atrial appendage, possibly reflecting enlargement of
 the left atrial appendage.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unremarkable, noting only calcification along the aortic arch.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Slight
 scarring is noted at each lung apex.  In addition, projecting over the left
 lung apex and clavicle is a nodular density of about 7 mm in size, possibly a
 lung nodule.  Linear opacities projecting over the left upper lobe suggest
 minor scarring.  The bones are probably demineralized.  There is a mild
 biconcave compression deformity involving an upper thoracic vertebral body.  A
 mid thoracic vertebral body shows mild but probably chronic loss in height. 
 Two lower thoracic vertebral bodies also show minimal compression deformities.
 Mild degenerative changes are noted along the mid thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  No evidence for free air.
 
 3.  Nodular focus projecting over the left lung apex, a possible lung nodule. 
 When clinically appropriate, evaluation with chest CT is recommended.  
 
 4.  Hyperinflation and suspected emphysema.
 
 5.  Suspected bony demineralization and mild compression deformities, likely
 chronic.  
 
 6.  Possible left atrial enlargement.  
 
 A preliminary reading was provided electronically while the patient was still
 in the ER.
