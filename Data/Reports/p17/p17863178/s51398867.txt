 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Lung volumes are low with patchy atelectasis
 noted in the lung bases.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There are mild degenerative changes noted in the
 thoracic spine.  Left subdiaphragmatic lucency likely reflects gas within a
 colonic loop of bowel.

 Low lung volumes with patchy atelectasis in the lung bases.
