                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  There is heterogeneous
 opacification involving the left mid to lower lung suggesting opacities in the
 lingula and left lower lobe.  It is difficult to exclude a small pleural
 effusion on the left side.  There is no pneumothorax. The bones appear
 demineralized.  Mild degenerative changes are noted along the mid through
 lower thoracic spine. Vascular calcifications are extensive.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification and involving left mid to lower lung regions,
 probably due to pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 resolution.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
