                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with abdominal pain, hematemesis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 aortic knob are again demonstrated.  Hilar contours are similar.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Airspace opacities within the left upper lobe
 appear progressed compared to the previous radiograph, with continued
 ill-defined opacities in both lung bases, more pronounced on the left, and not
 substantially changed in the interval.  New ill-defined opacification is also
 seen within the perihilar region in the right upper lobe.  Small left pleural
 effusion is present.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are mild degenerative
 changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right upper lobe ill-defined opacity and worsening left upper lobe
 airspace disease.  Similar appearance of bibasilar ill-defined opacities.
 Findings may reflect superimposed infection or aspiration on a background of
 COP.  Small left pleural effusion.
