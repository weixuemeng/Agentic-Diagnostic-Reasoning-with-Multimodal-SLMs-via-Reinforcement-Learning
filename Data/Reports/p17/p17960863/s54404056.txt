                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Better seen on the lateral view are patchy basilar opacities worrisome for
 pneumonia, probably for the most part in the right lower lobe; more anterior
 opacities are not as striking and may be within either the lingula or right
 middle lobe.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pneumonia.
