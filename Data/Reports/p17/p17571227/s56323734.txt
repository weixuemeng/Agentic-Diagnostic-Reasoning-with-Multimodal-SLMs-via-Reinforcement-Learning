                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Elevated white count, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is increased opacification at the right
 base posteriorly.  Although much of this has a linear quality, consistent with
 bands of atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Remainder of the study is within normal limits and there is evidence of prior
 cervical fusion.
