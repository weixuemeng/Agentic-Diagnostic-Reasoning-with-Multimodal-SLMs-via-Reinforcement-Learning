                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p intubation  // Eval ETT position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is noted terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the level
 of the carina. Low lung volumes results in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures. Streaky airspace opacities at the right lung base likely reflect
 atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary
 edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The patient is status post
 cervical spinal fusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube terminating 4.5 cm above the carina. Right basilar atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
