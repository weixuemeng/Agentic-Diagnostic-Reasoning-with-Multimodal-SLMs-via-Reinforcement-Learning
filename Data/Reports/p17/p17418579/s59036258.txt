                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax 
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison 15:0 and 18:30 today.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a pigtail catheter in the left
 chest.  The pigtail is not fully deployed.  A moderate left apical
 pneumothorax has not changed in size since the preceding study 2 hours ago. 
 It still measures 2.5 cm in greatest width.  There is no consolidation
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged appearance of a left apical pneumothorax despite chest tube
 placement.  Consider placing the patient in the right lateral decubitus
 position to shift of the pleural air closer to the tube.
