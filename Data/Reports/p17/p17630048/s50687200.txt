                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of cough.  Evaluation for pneumonia.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is normal in size with a left ventricular configuration and a
 tortuous aorta.  There is a focal opacity in the left retrocardiac region,
 which obscures the descending thoracic aortic interface.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  There is a mild dextroscoliosis and the bones appear generally
 demineralized.  The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or
 pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left lower lobe opacity which may represent focal/early pneumonia.  Recommend
 followup chest radiographs in ___ weeks to ensure resolution and to exclude a
 lung nodule in this region.
