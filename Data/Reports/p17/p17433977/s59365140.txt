 CHEST, TWO VIEWS No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal
 lymphadenopathy is detected.  No apical scarring or calcified nodules are
 identified. Possible minimal right convex curvature of the thoracic spine
 centered at T10/___. Visualized osseous structures are otherwise grossly
 unremarkable.
