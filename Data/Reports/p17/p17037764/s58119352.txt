                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain status post ERCP for pancreatitis and ileus, shortness
 of breath, please evaluate for etiology of chest pain and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___
 and CT abdomen and pelvis performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a
 nasogastric tube, although the tip is not well seen.  The side port appears to
 be located approximately 2.5 cm below the carina and with tip likely at the GE
 junction.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bilateral hila are engorged. 
 Heart size is top normal.  Faint right lower lung opacification is relatively
 unchanged compared to ___, and likely reflects atelectasis, exaggerated
 by bilateral low lung volumes.  No focal opacifications evident.  No overt
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube tip not well seen, but presumed to be at the GE
 junction as side port is evident in the mid-to-distal esophagus.  Minimal
 pulmonary edema.
