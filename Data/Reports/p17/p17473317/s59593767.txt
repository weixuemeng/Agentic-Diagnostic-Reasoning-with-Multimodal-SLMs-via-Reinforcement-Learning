                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cp radiating to back  // dissection?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Surgical clips are seen projecting over the left lung,
 compatible with patient's known history of breast surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  While there is no evidence of mediastinal
 widening, evaluation for aortic dissection is limited on radiograph.  If
 clinically indicated, CTA would be most appropriate modality.
