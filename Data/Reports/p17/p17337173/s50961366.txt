                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with right upper quadrant pain and LFTs increase
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest from outside hospital ___, chest radiograph
 from outside hospital ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium.  Lung volumes are
 low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette.  Heart size appears
 mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung
 bases, potentially atelectasis.  No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax is seen.  2 stents are noted within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar patchy opacities, potentially atelectasis.
