                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with neuroendocrine tumor mets to liver w/
 biliary obstruction s/p PTBDx2 now tachypneic after 1U FFP during procedure w/
 new hypoxia  // Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial
 junction.  There are markedly low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort.
 Patchy opacities throughout both lung fields may represent atelectasis or
 crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings due to the poor inspiratory
 effort.  I doubt significant pulmonary edema.  No large pneumothoraces are
 seen.
