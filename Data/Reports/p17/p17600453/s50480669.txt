 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small
 pleural he fusion.  The opacification adjacent to the right aspect of the
 mediastinum appears to have decreased.
 Right PICC line again extends to the lower SVC and there is again an
 impression on the lower cervical trachea, suggestive of a right thyroid mass.
