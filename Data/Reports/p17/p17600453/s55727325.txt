 INDICATION:  History: ___F with weakness  // eval for pna
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable semi supine AP radiograph demonstrates abnormal contour
 involving the pulmonary arterial window either enlarged left pulmonary artery
 or adenopathy.  Heart size is upper limits of normal.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is present. 
 There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  Imaged osseous
 structures and upper abdomen are without an acute abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the left pulmonary arterial window may reflect enlarged
 pulmonary artery or alternatively adenopathy.  No focal opacity convincing for
 pneumonia.
