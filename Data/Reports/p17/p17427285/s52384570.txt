                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pleural effusion  // evaluate for
 pneumonia/infiltrate s/p thoracentesis.Can do CXR at ___ Am on ___ thanks
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:   No prior study for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The medial right hemidiaphragm is obscured by a moderate sized right pleural
 effusion.  There is homogeneous opacification of the lung parenchyma below the
 right minor fissure due to right middle and right lower lobe collapse.  There
 is decreased vascularity of the right upper lung when compared to the left
 side.  The right perihilar region also appears more full and this could
 represent  a central mass compressing the right pulmonary vasculature and
 bronchi resulting in hypoperfusion of the right upper lung and collapse of the
 right middle and lower lobes.   The left lung is well-expanded and there is
 increased vascularity of the left lower lung likely secondary to physiologic
 increase in left lung perfusion.  The heart is normal sized.  A left
 Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper right atrium.  There is no
 pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1.  Right middle and right lower lobe collapse could be due to an obstructing
 right hilar mass.  Recommend follow-up chest CT with IV contrast for further
 evaluation.
 2. Persistent moderate size right pleural effusion.
 3. No complications nor pneumothorax status post thoracentesis
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend follow-up chest CT with IV contrast for further
 evaluation of suspected right hilar mass.
