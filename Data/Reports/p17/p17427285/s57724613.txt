                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p thoracenthesis  // r/o PTX
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a right pleural effusion
 has substantially decreased following thoracentesis procedure, with small to
 moderate pleural effusion remaining.  Peripheral opacity in right upper lobe
 is a persistent finding, and areas of atelectasis in the right middle and
 right lower lobes have decreased in extent.  These findings are more fully
 evaluated by a subsequently performed CT, dictated separately.  Post radiation
 changes in the right paramediastinal region are unchanged.
