                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever cough, metastatic cancer, and
 history of pleural effusion.  Evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Port placement images from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left Port-A-Cath tip ends in the right atrium.  The lower half of the right
 hemi thorax is completely opacified with silhouetting of the right
 hemidiaphragm border and the right heart border.  This is consistent with a
 moderate pleural effusion although there is not significant mass effect,
 suggesting a component of significant volume loss as well.  Any concurrent
 pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical situation but cannot be
 assessed in the setting of this moderate pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
 The left lung is essentially clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion with probable significant associated
 atelectasis.  Any concurrent infection is possible in the appropriate clinical
 situation and can not be well assessed in the setting of an effusion.
