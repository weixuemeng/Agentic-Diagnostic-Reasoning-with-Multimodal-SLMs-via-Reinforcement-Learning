                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged.  Mild atherosclerotic
 calcifications are demonstrated at the aortic arch. Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable. Minimal linear atelectasis is noted within the
 right upper lobe.  Patchy opacities in both lower lobes are minimal, and
 likely relate to areas of atelectasis.  The right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view. There is minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle which may be due to trace left pleural fluid. No
 pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 suggests a trace left pleural effusion.
