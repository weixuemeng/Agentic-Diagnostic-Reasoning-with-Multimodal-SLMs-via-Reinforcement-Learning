                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  Markedly suboptimal evaluation technically.  Allowing for this,
 respiratory motion and some suboptimal inspiratory effort, the lungs are
 probably grossly clear and no definitive infiltrate is noted.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No definitive acute findings. 
 
 Unchanged post-traumatic osteolysis and secondary change of the left AC joint.
 Incidentally, the right eighth rib is noted to be fractured as on prior
 radiograph.
