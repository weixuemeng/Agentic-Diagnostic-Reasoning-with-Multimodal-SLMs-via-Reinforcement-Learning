                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST 2 VIEWS ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  On today's frontal view, lower lung volumes are seen. 
 Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis given these lower lung volumes
 and as they are not visualized on the lateral view.  Superiorly, the lungs are
 clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is suggestion of a
 posterior eighth rib fracture, however, superimposed linear vascular markings
 may contribute to this appearance.  Other soft tissue and osseous structures
 are unremarkable.
 
 There are chronic changes identified at the left acromioclavicular joint which
 appears separated with superior subluxation of the lateral clavicle.  There is
 adjacent dystrophic calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible posterior
 right eighth rib fracture vs. overlapping linear parenchymal opacities. 
 Dedicated views can be performed if desired.
