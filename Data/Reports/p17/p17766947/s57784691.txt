  Right lung opacities for which nonurgent dedicated chest CT is suggested to
  further characterize.  Coarse interstitial lung markings suggestive of chronic
  underlying lung disease and probable cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  There are vague opacities projecting over
 the right lung, the larger of the 2 projects over the mid upper lung.  This is
 not well seen on the lateral view which is suboptimal due to motion. 
 Otherwise the lungs are notable for diffuse coarse interstitial markings which
 may represent chronic underlying lung disease.  Cardiac silhouette is likely
 enlarged given limitation of this technique and significant mid thoracic
 dextroscoliosis.  Degenerative changes noted at the right acromioclavicular
 joint.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right lung opacities for which nonurgent dedicated chest CT is suggested to
 further characterize.  Coarse interstitial lung markings suggestive of chronic
 underlying lung disease and probable cardiomegaly.
