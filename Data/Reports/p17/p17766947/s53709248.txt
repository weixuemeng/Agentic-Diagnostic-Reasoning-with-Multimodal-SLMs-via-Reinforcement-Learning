                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough and SOB  // Please eval for pulm edema vs
 pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains scoliotic.Lung volumes are relatively low.  There is
 diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally which may relate to
 chronic lung disease and/ or interstitial edema.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of atelectasis
 and interstitial lung disease/edema, however, consolidation due to infection
 or aspiration not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with
 with prominence of the main pulmonary artery suggesting component of pulmonary
 hypertension..
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to chronic lung disease
 and/or interstitial edema.
 
 Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of
 interstitial lung markings and atelectasis, although focal consolidation due
 to infection or aspiration is not entirely excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
 
 Persistent prominence of the main pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary
 hypertension.
