 outside hospital and told he had pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 3 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior exam.  Persistent prominent
 hilar vascularity is stable.  Diffuse reticular opacities have slightly
 improved since prior study and remain concentrated in the lung bases.  A
 linear band of fibrosis in the lingula is unchanged.  Lungs are otherwise
 without focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.

 Mildly improved diffuse reticular abnormalities without focal findings to
 suggest pneumonia.
