                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with history NSIP, now with worsening dyspnea,
 productive cough and slightly worsened PFTs.  Evaluate for pneumonia or
 worsening NSIP.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild, but widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has worsened since
 ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly has also progressed, so there is a
 possibility of a component of cardiac decompensation,  but there is no pleural
 effusion or vascular plethora in the peripheral lungs. There are no focal
 abnormalities to suggest pneumonia.  Interval enlargement of the hila could be
 explained by worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension, in turn the
 explanation for enlarging heart size.
