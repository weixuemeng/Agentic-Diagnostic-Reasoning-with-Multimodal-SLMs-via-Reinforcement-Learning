                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with history of asthma now with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large body habitus and underpenetration on technique limits evaluation. Within
 this limitation, the cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
 Streaky opacities in the lower lobes on the lateral radiograph most likely
 reflect atelectasis. No significant focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is appreciated. The pulmonary vasculature is essentially within
 normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild lower lobe atelectasis. Please note evaluation is limited due to
 underpenetration.
