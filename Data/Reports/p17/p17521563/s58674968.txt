                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with history of asthma and congestive heart failure
 now presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior radiograph from ___, there is a new left pleural
 effusion and a small right pleural effusion, increasing heart size, and
 increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  More
 confluent opacity at the lung bases could reflect dependent distribution of
 edema but superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings are most compatible with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions. Superimposed infection or aspiration in the lung bases cannot be
 excluded, and followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this
 regard.
