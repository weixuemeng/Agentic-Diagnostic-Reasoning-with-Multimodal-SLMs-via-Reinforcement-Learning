                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with altered mental status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as result of low lung volumes
 appearing borderline enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema.  Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
