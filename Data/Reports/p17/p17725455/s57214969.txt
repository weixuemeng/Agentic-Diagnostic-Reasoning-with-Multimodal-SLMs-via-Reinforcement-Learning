                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dizziness and lethargy.  // ? acute
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta remains
 mildly tortuous.  The hilar contours are within normal limits.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis.  Focal nodular opacity measuring approximately 10 mm projecting
 over the left third rib anteriorly is not clearly localized on the lateral
 view, but appears thickened present on the previous exam projecting over the
 left lung base.  No acute osseous abnormality is clearly noted.  There is mild
 loss of height of an upper lumbar vertebral body, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
 2. Vague 10 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left third rib anteriorly
 was likely present on the previous chest radiograph.  Assessment with
 nonemergent chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
