                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy, reported recent pneumonia at outside facility.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal supine AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Opacity in the left upper lobe is concerning for pneumonia, although
 underlying mass cannot be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 slightly indistinct with increased interstitial markings and Kerly B lines
 suggesting mild pulmonary edema.  The right hilar contour and mild opacity is
 similar to ___.  
 
 A right dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium, unchanged.  An abandoned
 dual-lumen catheter terminates in the lower SVC. A smaller catheter fragment
 projecting over the heart on the frontal view projects over the lung
 parenchyma on the lateral view is likely an embolized catheter fragment in a
 pulmonary vessel, unchanged in position since ___. 
 
 smaller one is embolized catheter fragment in a pulmonary vessel, no change
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Left upper lobe pneumonia superimposed on mild pulmonary edema. Recommend
 follow up radiograph ___ weeks after treatment to evaluate for underlying
 parenchymal lesion.
 2. Embolized catheter fragment within a pulmonary vessel, likely from the
 abandoned dual lumen catheter, is unchanged in position since ___. Per
 the report from that study, a CT was recommended at that time and may have
 been performed at an outside institution.
