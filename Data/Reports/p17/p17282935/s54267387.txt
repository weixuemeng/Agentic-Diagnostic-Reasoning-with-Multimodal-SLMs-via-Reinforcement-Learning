                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left-sided pneumonia, intubated with ESRD.  Evaluate pneumonia and
 fluid status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to prior study there appears to be worsening of the left-sided
 opacification which appears to be within nearly the entire left lung with
 obliteration of the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm.  There is a
 small focus of relative hyperlucency in the left cardiophrenic angle compared
 to the rest of the lung and may represent a small, loculated pneumothorax. 
 The orogastric tube has been removed.  There is otherwise no change compared
 the prior study with persistent pulmonary edema.  A right dual lumen dialysis
 catheter is unchanged in position.  Remnant of a left-sided dialysis catheter
 is unchanged in position with a small piece of the tip broken off and lodged
 in a distal left pulmonary artery, unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Endotracheal tube remains in place in appropriate position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of left lung opacification which may be due to progressive
 pneumonia or worsening edema.  An underlying lung mass cannot be excluded. 
 Relative lucency of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a loculated
 pneumothorax.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 11:58 on ___ at time of initial review.
