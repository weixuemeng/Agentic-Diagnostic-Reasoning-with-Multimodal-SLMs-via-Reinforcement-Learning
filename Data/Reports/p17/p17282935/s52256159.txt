                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with question of flash pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, respectively at 15:38 and 2:05.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates unchanged position of
 right subclavian approach central venous catheter and apparently abandoned
 left approach central line tubing.  The heart is top normal in size.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for rotation.
 Dense consolidation in the left upper lobe is progressively more dense as
 compared to prior exams, most compatible with pneumonia.  A slightly less
 dense consolidation is likely present in the right lower lobe.  Underlying
 lesion in the left upper lung cannot be assessed.  Streaky bibasilar
 subsegmental atelectasis is present.  There is a similar to slightly increased
 degree of central pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Confluent consolidation in the left upper lobe and likely
 additional focus of consolidation in the right lower lobe, suggestive of
 multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend treatment and followup to resolution to
 exclude underlying lesion.
