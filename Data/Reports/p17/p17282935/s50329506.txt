 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large mass-like opacity in the left upper lobe has decreased in
 size and appears slightly more well defined compared to the previous study,
 now measuring about 7.5 cm and previously measuring about 9.5 cm.  Pulmonary
 vascular congestion has worsened and is accompanied by interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Improved aeration at the lung bases, particularly within the left
 retrocardiac region, with residual linear atelectasis remaining.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions have improved.  Indwelling support and monitoring devices
 are unchanged in position.
