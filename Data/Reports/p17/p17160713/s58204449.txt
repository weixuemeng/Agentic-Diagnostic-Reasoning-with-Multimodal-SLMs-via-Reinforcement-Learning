                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  Widespread pleural
 plaques are noted with calcifications.  There is a meniscoid appearance to
 each costophrenic sulcus, which may reflect pleural thickening or very small
 effusions.  Projecting over the central left lung is patchy opacification. 
 For the most part, this is suspected to represent a pleural plaque but a
 superimposed parenchymal opacity in the area is suggested on the lateral view
 without a mass-like appearance and may reflect atelectasis, scarring or even
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left mid lung opacity, which can be largely explained as a
 pleural plaque but a parenchymal opacity in the vicinity is suspected but not
 well characterized, potentially atelectasis or scarring although pneumonia is
 not excluded.
