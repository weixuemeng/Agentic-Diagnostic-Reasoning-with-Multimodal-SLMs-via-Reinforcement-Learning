 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  New left PICC terminates within the mid superior vena cava. 
 Pre-existing right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the
 proximal to mid superior vena cava just above this level.  Stable
 cardiomegaly, but slight improvement in the mid and lower lung interstitial
 pattern which likely represents improving interstitial edema.  Multifocal
 areas of linear atelectasis persist in the lung bases, and small pleural
 effusions are also demonstrated.
