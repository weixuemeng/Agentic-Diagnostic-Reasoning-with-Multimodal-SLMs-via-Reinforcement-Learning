                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Persistent
 elevation of left hemidiaphragm and adjacent small left pleural effusion as
 well as multiple poorly defined peripheral opacities in the left mid and lower
 lungs, likely corresponding to pulmonary infarcts in the setting of known
 diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.  Focal subsegmental atelectasis is present in
 the right mid lung; the right lung is otherwise clear, and there is no
 evidence of right pleural effusion.
