 overload
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing engorgement of
 indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 worsening pulmonary edema.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged in a

 No definite focal consolidation, though in the appropriate clinical setting it
 would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
