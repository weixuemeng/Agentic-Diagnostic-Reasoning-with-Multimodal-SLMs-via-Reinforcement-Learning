 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with foot and rib pain after fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Overall hazy density of the lung bases is
 likely secondary to overlying soft tissue attenuation.  No confluent opacity
 is identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Mild cardiomegaly appears unchanged.  No definite rib
 fracture is visualized.  Thoracic vertebral body heights appear preserved 
 Cervical spinal hardware is new from prior and partially imaged on this
 current examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No definite rib fracture on
 this chest radiographic examination.  Dedicated rib series radiographs are
 recommended if there is ongoing clinical concern for acute rib fracture,
