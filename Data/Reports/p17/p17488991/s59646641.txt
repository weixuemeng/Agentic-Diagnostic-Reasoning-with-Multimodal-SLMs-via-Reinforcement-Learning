                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of partial
 nephrectomy to exclude the possibility of renal cell metastatic involvement of
 the lungs.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___ and multiple prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  5-mm nodular
 opacities in both costophrenic sinuses appear unchanged at least since
 ___ and most likely represent minimal interstitial changes,
 giving their stability are unlikely to reflect metastatic involvement.  No new
 pulmonary nodules, masses, or consolidations have been demonstrated.  There is
 no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
