                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of left-sided hydrothorax,
 right partial nephrectomy for cancer, evaluate for possible recurrence.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  The heart size is
 unchanged and remains normal.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta and
 mediastinal structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs
 of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present.  The lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses remain free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area on
 the frontal view. When comparison is made with the next preceding study, the
 especially mentioned very small (less than 0.5 cm) rounded and well-demarcated
 densities on the left lung base remain completely unchanged.  Thus, they
 appear to represent scar formations after old previous inflammatory process. 
 There is no evidence of any new pulmonary abnormality that raises suspicion
 for secondary deposits in this patient with a history of previously successful
 operated renal cell carcinoma.
