  Moderate amount of subdiaphragmatic free air anticipated after recent
  abdominal surgery.  Compared with preop exam there is new LLL atelectasis with
  probable left sided effusion.  There is also vascular congestion with upper
  redistribution.  Low lung volumes account for appearance of worsening
  cardiomegaly which is due to horizontalization of the heart.

 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fevers, infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patient is
 status post median sternotomy.  In the interval since the prior study, there
 has been development of pneumoperitoneum, anticipated after recent abdominal
 surgery.  Compared with the pre-operative chest radiograph, there is a left
 lower lobe atelectasis with probable left-sided small pleural effusion and
 possible trace right pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion may
 be present with prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.  There is
 left mid lung atelectasis as well.  Small amount of right lateral abdominal
 subcutaneous emphysema is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable given differences in technique and patient's position.
