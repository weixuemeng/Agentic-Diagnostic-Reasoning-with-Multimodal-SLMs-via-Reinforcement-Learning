                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  AMS suspected infection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Left large supraclavicular central
 catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with
 tortuous aorta and tortuous neck vessels.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Retrocardiac opacity has almost resolved consistent with resolving
 atelectasis.  Amount of pleural effusion is difficult to assess, probably
 small.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.  Mild vascular congestion
 is stable.  There are no new lung abnormalities.
