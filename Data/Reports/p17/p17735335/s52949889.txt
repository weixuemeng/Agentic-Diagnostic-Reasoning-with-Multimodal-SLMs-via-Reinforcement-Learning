                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the pulmonary vascular congestion
 has improved.  Central catheter remains in place.  Residual opacification at
 the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with
 layering effusion and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
