                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Acute on chronic delirium.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is markedly enlarged.  A convex contour to the left upper
 cardiac border suggests the likelihood of left atrial appendage enlargement.
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous, probably also somewhat ectatic but
 unchanged.  Nodular opacities are again present including one projecting over
 the left upper lobe measuring about 21 mm in diameter and one projecting over
 the right mid lung of 17 mm in diameter.  These are concerning for lung
 nodules.  There is a background interstitial abnormality, but increased,
 suggesting superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Fissures are thickened, a new finding.  New small pleural
 effusions are suspected.  Several mid thoracic compression deformities appear
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multiple suspicious nodules worrisome for metastatic disease. 
 Increased interstitial abnormality suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Similar ony demineralization and compression fractures, stable.  A chest CT is
 suggested to assess further when clinically indicated.
