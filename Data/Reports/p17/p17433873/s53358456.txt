 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
 
 AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there is substantial improvement in pulmonary edema. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, large, right more than left, appear unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size cannot be
 assessed precisely giving the obscuration of the heart borders by pleural
 effusion.
