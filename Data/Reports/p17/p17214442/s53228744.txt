                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC line is unchanged in position, terminating just beyond the
 superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Evaluation of the lung
 parenchyma is somewhat limited by low lung volumes.  However, new increased
 opacification at both lung bases may be due to subsegmental atelectasis,
 infection or aspiration. Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema
 are new. There are new small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New bibasilar airspace opacities may be due to aspiration, dependent edema, or
 possibly infection.  Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this
 regard.
 Pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
