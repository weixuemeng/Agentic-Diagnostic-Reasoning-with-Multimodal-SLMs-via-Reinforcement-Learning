                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Patchy right
 middle to lower lung opacity best seen on the frontal view with prominence of
 the right hilum is seen.  Given lack of infectious symptoms, findings are
 concerning for right lower lung pulmonary mass with right-sided
 lymphadenopathy.  Pneumonia is also in the differential, although seems less
 likely given clinical scenario.  The left lung is clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  Slight prominence of the AP
 window is nonspecific but lymphadenopathy in that location is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity with prominence of the right hilum
 raises concern for right lower lung mass with right-sided lymphadenopathy
 given lack of infectious symptoms.  Chest CT is pending.
