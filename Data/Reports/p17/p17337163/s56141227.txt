                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lung mass after biopsy.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is no pneumothorax after biopsy.  A rounded
 opacity in the right lower lung is slightly larger than prior and likely
 reflects a small component of hemorrhage after biopsy superimposed on the lung
 nodule.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is mildly enlarged but
 unchanged.
