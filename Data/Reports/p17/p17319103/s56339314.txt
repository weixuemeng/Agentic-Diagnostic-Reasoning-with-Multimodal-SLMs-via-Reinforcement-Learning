                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___ and CT C-spine of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large left superior mediastinal mass displacing trachea to the
 right with associated mild coronal tracheal narrowing is consistent with known
 longstanding left thyroid mass.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size
 and demonstrates left ventricular configuration.  Aorta is tortuous, without
 change.  Coarse linear opacities are present at the left lung base as well as
 minimal linear opacities in the right lower lobe.  No confluent areas of
 consolidation or pleural effusion are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left superior mediastinal mass, consistent with previously described
 thyroid goiter on CT cervical spine study of ___.
 2.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis and/or scarring.
