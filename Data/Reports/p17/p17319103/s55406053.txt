 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are noted. There is confluent opacity in the left lung base
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm with additional patchy region slightly superior
 to the cardiac silhouette. Elsewhere the lungs are clear. The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged but likely exaggerated by low lung volumes. Rightward
 tracheal deviation with increased soft tissue at the upper mediastinum is
 compatible with left-sided thyroid enlargement. No acute osseous abnormalities
 identified. Impression
