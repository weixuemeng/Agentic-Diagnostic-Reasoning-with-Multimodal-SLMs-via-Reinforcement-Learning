                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Nonproductive cough and crackles.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  There are low lung volumes.  There is
 interstitial subpleural abnormality in the mid lung, greater on the left side,
 grossly unchanged from ___.  This is consistent with interstitial lung
 disease.  For further evaluation high-resolution CT can be performed.  There
 is no evidence of pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
