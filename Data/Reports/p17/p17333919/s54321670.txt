 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Lung volumes are decreased.  There is moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There is no new focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Reticular opacities at the periphery of the
 lungs are likely secondary to known fibrosing interstitial lung disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No focal consolidation.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
 3. Reticular opacities in the periphery of the lungs are likely secondary to
 known fibrosing interstitial lung disease.
