 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 6:26 PM
  No pneumothorax.  Near complete consolidation of the right upper lobe as on
  recent CT examination in location of known mass.  Trace right effusion.  Right
  greater than left reticular opacities as on prior CT examination remain
  suspicious for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with RUL mass s/p TBBx  // r.o Ptx      r.o Ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is now homogeneous opacity extending from the preexisting large right
 perihilar mass to the right upper lateral chest wall.  This could be due
 either to atelectasis developing since ___ or new localized pleural
 thickening or fluid.  Whether either change is due to interval transbronchial
 biopsy is difficult to say since there is no radiograph taken immediately
 prior to the biopsy.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Small region of consolidation at the base the right lung is slightly larger
 today.  The generalized interstitial abnormality, some which may be due to
 carcinomatosis is more pronounced today.  In the setting of greater vascular
 caliber, this is probably a component of mild pulmonary edema, although heart
 size is normal, unchanged.
