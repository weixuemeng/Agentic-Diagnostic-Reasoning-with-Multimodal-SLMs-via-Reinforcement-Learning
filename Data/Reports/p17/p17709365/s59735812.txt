                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer complicated by duodenal obstruction with shortness
 of breath and fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  Mild prominence of the right hilum appears unchanged.  As
 seen previously, there are asymmetric interstitial opacities in the right lung
 with peribronchial cuffing and a particularly heavy concentration of these
 about the right hilum, but not significantly changed since the recent prior
 radiographs.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no
 evidence for free air.  Mild rightward convex curvature is noted at the
 thoracolumbar junction.  A stent projects over the right upper quadrant in a
 similar position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the chest.  No evidence of free air.
