                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with pancreatic CA and neutropenia in the
 ED with rigors, chills and dry cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The right
 Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC. Mild opacity in the right mid lung on the
 frontal view, not clearly seen on the lateral view, may represent early or
 developing pneumonia. There is no dense consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are normal. Cerclage wires in the cervical spine are incompletely
 evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle opacity in the right mid lung on the frontal view may
 represent early pneumonia.
