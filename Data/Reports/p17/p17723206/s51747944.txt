                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory asthma, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The lung volumes are at the upper range of normal, but currently no
 signs of overinflation are seen.  The shape of the hemidiaphragms is normal. 
 There is mild leftward scoliosis and a normal size of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Minimal pleural irregularities of symmetrical distribution at both lung apices
 suggest the presence of subtle parenchymal scars.  However, no larger
 opacities potentially suggesting recent pneumonia are seen.  No pleural
 effusions, no other lung parenchymal changes.  The mediastinal and hilar
 structures are normal.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumopericardium.
