                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Marked prominence of main
 pulmonary artery segment is similar to older chest x-ray of ___,
 and corresponds to an enlarged main pulmonary artery on CTA of ___.  New asymmetrically distributed perihilar haziness involving the right
 lung to a greater degree than the left may reflect asymmetrical pulmonary
 edema or a developing perihilar pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
