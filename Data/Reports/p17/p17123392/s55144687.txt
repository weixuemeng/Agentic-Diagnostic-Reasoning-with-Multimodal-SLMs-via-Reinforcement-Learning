                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pulmonary arterial hypertension, restrictive
 lung disease with cough  // edema vs. effusion vs. infectious process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and both hila are
 compatible with the provided history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No
 pulmonary edema is noted.  Patchy opacities are seen in the right lung base. 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Patchy bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Enlargement of the hila bilaterally compatible with the history of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 3. Minimal patchy right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis.  Infection
 is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.
