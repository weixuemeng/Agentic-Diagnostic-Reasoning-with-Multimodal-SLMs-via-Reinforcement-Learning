                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ as well as ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The main pulmonary artery contour is
 again mildly enlarged.  Mild enlargement of each hilum may be accounted for
 also by enlargement of central pulmonary arteries and perhaps mild lymph node
 enlargement, as seen previously, more striking on the right than eft.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  Mild
 degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings similar to baseline including enlarged central pulmonary
 arteries and probably mild persistent prominence of bilateral hilar lymph
 nodes, especially on the right.
