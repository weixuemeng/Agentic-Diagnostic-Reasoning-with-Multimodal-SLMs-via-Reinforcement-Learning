                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and myalgias.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis and chest radiograph from ___.
 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Known right lower lobe pulmonary nodule is not clearly delineated on this
 study.  The lungs are otherwise clear with no evidence of a consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  Prominence of the right hilum remains stable and
 consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.  No acute fractures are identified.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
 2.  Known right lung base nodule is not clearly delineated on this study.  
 
 3.  Prominence of the right pulmonary artery likely reflects underlying
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.
