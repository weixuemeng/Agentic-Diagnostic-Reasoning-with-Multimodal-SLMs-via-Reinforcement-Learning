 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly and widening of the hilar structures, potentially indicative of
 pulmonary hypertension.  There also is mild predominantly interstitial fluid
 overload, as reflected by peribronchial cuffing.  No larger pleural effusions
 are present.  Mild atelectasis at the left lung base.
