                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are also stable with prominence of the main
 pulmonary artery.  Perihilar hazy opacification is once again more pronounced
 on the right similar to what it was on prior study, such as on the ___ study, which likely reflects asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an
 infectious process in the correct clinical setting would also certainly be
 possible.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right perihilar opacities concerning for asymmetric
 pulmonary edema similar to on the prior studies versus infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Again seen enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 and prominence of the main pulmonary artery.
