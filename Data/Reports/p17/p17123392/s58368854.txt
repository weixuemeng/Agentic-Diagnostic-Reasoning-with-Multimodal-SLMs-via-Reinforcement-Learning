                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Abdominal pain, distention.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  No pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is a right infrahilar opacity, which may be due to
 aspiration and/or infection.  Left lung is clear.  Prominence of the right
 hilum is stable.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No evidence of free air is seen
 beneath the diaphragms.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.  Prominence of the right
 hilum likely relates to patient's known pulmonary hypertension.
 2.  Right infrahilar opacity could be due to infection and/or aspiration.
