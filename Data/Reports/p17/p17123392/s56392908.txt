                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea and cough.  Assess acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There is stable
 borderline cardiomegaly.  There is again noted to be prominence of the right
 pulmonary hilum which is unchanged compared with multiple prior exams and is
 thought to reflect patient's known pulmonary hypertension and enlarged
 pulmonary arteries.  Please note, the patient is also known to have hilar
 lymphadenopathy as seen on prior CT chest from ___.  There is similar
 overall appearance of the chest compared with the prior exam with no overt
 signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall stable exam without clear evidence of pneumonia or CHF. 
 Stable prominence of the right pulmonary hilum which has been previously
 attributed to pulmonary arterial enlargement and lymphadenopathy.  Please
 correlate clinically as to the appropriateness of CT chest to further assess.
