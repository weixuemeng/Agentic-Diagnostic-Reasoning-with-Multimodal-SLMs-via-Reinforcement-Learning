                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diastolic congestive heart failure, restrictive lung disease,
 pulmonary hypertension, chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are also stable, with prominence of the main pulmonary artery
 indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Perihilar hazy opacification
 which is more pronounced on the right likely reflects mild asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, similar to that seen on the previous exam.   No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, similar to that seen on the previous exam.
