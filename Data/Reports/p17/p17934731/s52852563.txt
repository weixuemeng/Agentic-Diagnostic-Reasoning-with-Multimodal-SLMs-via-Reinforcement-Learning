                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post laparoscopic adrenalectomy with
 nausea, vomiting.  Question pulmonary edema or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___.  CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates marked levoconvex
 thoracic scoliosis, distorting cardiomediastinal contours.  Allowing for such
 the heart is normal in size.  An air-fluid level projecting over the heart is
 consistent with a large hiatal hernia.  The lungs are clear, without evidence
 of pneumothorax, consolidation, or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process, including pneumonia
 or pulmonary edema as queried.
 2.  Marked thoracic scoliosis and moderate to large hiatal hernia.
