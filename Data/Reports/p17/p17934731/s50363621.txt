                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 New onset left-sided chest pain, history of myocardial infarction.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph ___ chest CT.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Marked rotary levoscoliosis slightly limits assessment.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Mild bronchial wall thickening is noted in the right
 lung base, compatible with bronchiectasis as seen on the prior chest CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
