                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate possible pneumothorax versus bleb.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is better inspiratory
 effort.  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   The cardiac size is at the upper limits of
 normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  A known thyroid goiter is
 causing mild rightward tracheal deviation and upper mediastinal widening,
 unchanged from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically, no visualized pneumothorax.
