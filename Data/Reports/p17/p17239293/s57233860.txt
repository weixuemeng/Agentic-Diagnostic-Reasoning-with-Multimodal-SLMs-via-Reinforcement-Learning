                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post sternoclavicular joint debridement. R/A in PACU.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 External material overlies the area of sternoclavicular joint debridement. 
 The left PICC line is in unchanged position.  There are very low lung volumes.
 Allowing for lung volumes, as well as a lordotic view, technique and position,
 no gross discrete pulmonary abnormality is present.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present.  Low lung volumes, technique and position accentuate
 heart size.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The indication for the study is unclear.  External material is seen overlying
 the sternoclavicular joint debridement site and no gross discrete pulmonary
 abnormalities are present allowing for very limited exam.
