                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right clavicular/superclavicular pain with fevers.  Evaluate
 right clavicle and supraclavicular space.  Also, attention to right effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest, one day prior, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.  No pneumothorax
 is present.  Although a small right pleural effusion was noted on CT one day
 prior, it is not visualized on this radiograph.  The bony structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable radiograph of the chest.  Please refer to chest CT
 and MR which are more sensitive in the evaluation of the bones and soft
 tissues.
