                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with dyspnea, afebrile, good oxygen
 saturation, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated
 ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly, similar configurational appearance
 persists, rather unchanged.  There is a relative prominence of the left
 ventricular contour to the left, but the lateral view also discloses some
 enlargement of the left atrium in posterior direction.  The thoracic aorta is
 moderately widened and elongated.  There exists also an unusual prominence of
 the right atrial contour and the azygos vein contour is moderately distended. 
 The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern,
 but there is no evidence of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema and the
 pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  No evidence of
 local discrete parenchymal infiltrates of inflammatory nature.
 
 The degree of cardiomegaly is rather stable.  Likewise, there is no evidence
 of increased pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion.  No acute infiltrates
 are seen.  If not already performed earlier, an echocardiogram could be of
 diagnostic interest and importance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly, but absence of acute CHF or
 acute pulmonary infiltrates.
