                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is at least moderate to severely enlarged.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures with mild to moderate pulmonary edema present.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
