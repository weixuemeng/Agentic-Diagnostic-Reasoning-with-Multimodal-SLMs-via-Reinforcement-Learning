                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Mild-to-moderately enlarged
 heart size may be exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Central pulmonary
 vasculature is mildly prominent suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion, but no over edema. Increased retrocardiac opacity suggestes lower
 lung atelectasis and given low lung volumes, any element of concurrent
 pneumonia cannot be ruled out.  Upper lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
 abnormality.
