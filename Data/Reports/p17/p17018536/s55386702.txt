                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:41 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a history of sleep apnea, now with altered
 mental status and tachypnea after sedation.
 
 AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are still quite low, but it looks like there is a mild pulmonary
 edema congregated at the lung bases which are substantially atelectatic,
 particularly the left.  I would recommend continued close followup to detect
 any developing pneumonia.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  Poor definition
 of the lumens of central bronchi could be due to retained secretions,
 contributing to atelectasis and potentially pneumonia.  Stomach is at least
 moderately distended with air and fluid and should also be monitored.
