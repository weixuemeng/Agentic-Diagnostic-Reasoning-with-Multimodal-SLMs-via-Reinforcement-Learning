 1.  Right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the proximal

 Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely representing
 atelectasis, although pneumonia and/or aspiration could have this appearance. 
 Heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial
 effusion should also be considered.  Prominent pulmonary arteries consistent
 with known underlying pulmonary artery hypertension, which was recently
 diagnosed on a chest CT dated ___.  Probable layering right effusion
