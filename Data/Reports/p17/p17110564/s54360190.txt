                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue,
 though a trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  Additional left basilar
 opacity could be due to atelectasis/scarring, although underlying
 consolidation due to pneumonia or aspiration is not excluded.  No definite
 focal consolidation is seen on the right.  There is no right pleural effusion.
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and
 tortuous.
