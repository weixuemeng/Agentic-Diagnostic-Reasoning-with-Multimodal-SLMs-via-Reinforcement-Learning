 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the diameter of the
 pulmonary vessels has minimally increased, likely reflecting mild fluid
 overload.  The lateral radiograph manifests the presence of bilateral small
 pleural effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly with normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.  No evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
