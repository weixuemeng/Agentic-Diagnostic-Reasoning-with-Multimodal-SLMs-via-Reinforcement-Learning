 HISTORY:  Generalized weakness.  Assess for infectious source.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 are low in volume with basal opacities which are likely atelectasis.  Mild
 vascular congestion is seen without overt edema.  The heart is top normal in
 size with pleural fluid noted along the major fissure.  There is no
 pneumothorax with small likely bilateral dependent pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with mild vascular congestion and trace pleural
 effusions.
