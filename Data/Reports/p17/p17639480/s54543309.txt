                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with generalized weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is increased in size compared
 to the prior study, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and AP
 technique. Similarly, the superior mediastinum appears widened and again is
 likely due to differences in technique and poor inspiratory volumes. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear. No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes without acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
