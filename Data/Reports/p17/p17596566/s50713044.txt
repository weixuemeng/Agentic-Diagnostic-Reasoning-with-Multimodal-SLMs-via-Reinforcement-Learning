                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for Swan position.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Compared with prior film from ___ at 19:03 pm, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been retracted.  The tip now overlies the expected origin of the right main
 pulmonary artery.  
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Mediastinal drains and
 bilateral chest tubes again noted.  No pneumothorax detected.  Mild vascular
 plethora/interstitial edema is essentially unchanged.
