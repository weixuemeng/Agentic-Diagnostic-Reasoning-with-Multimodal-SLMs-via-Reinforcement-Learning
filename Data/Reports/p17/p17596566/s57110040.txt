                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of intra-aortic balloon pump.  Please evaluate for
 location.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ performed earlier in the day.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. 
 There has been interval retraction of the intra-aortic balloon pump with the
 radiopaque marker now projecting over the proximal descending aorta. 
 Swan-Ganz catheter continues to terminate in the right main pulmonary artery
 and should be pulled back if desired  location is in the main pulmonary
 outflow tract.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are persistent; however,
 there has been interval improvement of the diffuse mild pulmonary edema.  Mild
 bibasilar atelectasis is persistent.  Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm
 with the tip out of view of this film.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval retraction of intra-aortic balloon pump which now terminates in the
 proximal descending aorta.  
 
 Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema.
