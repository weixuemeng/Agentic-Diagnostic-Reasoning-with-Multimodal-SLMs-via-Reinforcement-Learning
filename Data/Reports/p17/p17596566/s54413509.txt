                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG, evaluate for effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OBTAINED SUPINE.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 19:43 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.0 cm above the carina.  Apparent NG
 tube -- tip is partially obscured but it appears to extend beneath diaphragm,
 off the film.  Bilateral chest tubes present.  Probable mediastinal drain.  A
 right Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the main pulmonary artery.  
 
 Sternotomy wires present.  Compared to the prior film, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and mild vascular plethora with bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
 No gross effusion is seen on either side. 
 
 No convincing pneumothorax is identified on this supine film. Slight
 curvilinear lucency along the lateral left hemidiaphragm likely represents
 ___ artifact, but attention to this area on followup films to assess for
 subtle left base pneumothorax is requested.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung findings are grossly unchanged.
 3.   No convincing evidence of pneumothorax identified.  However, attention to
 the left lateral lung base on followup films to assess for subtle left base
 pneumothorax is requested.
