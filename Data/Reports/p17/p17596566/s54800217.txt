 no evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions.  Two hyperlucent
 lines projecting over the right hemithorax were visible on the previous
 radiograph and correspond to skin folds.  The patient remains intubated.  The
 position of the right venous introduction sheath, the left subclavian line,
 the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are constant.  Constant
 alignment of the sternal wires.
