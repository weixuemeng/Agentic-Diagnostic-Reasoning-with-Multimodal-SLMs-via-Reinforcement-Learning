                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease status post V-fib arrest and
 intubated, now with intra-aortic balloon pump.  Please evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___, most recently from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 6.8 cm above the carina.  A
 Swan-Ganz catheter is positioned with the tip in the right main pulmonary
 artery, overall unchanged in position compared to the prior exam.  Enteric
 tube traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. 
 Layering right-sided effusion has improved compared to the prior exam.  Linear
 radiopaque structure seen projecting over the proximal descending thoracic
 aorta is in the expected location and demarcates the intra-aortic balloon pump
 marker.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Overall, lines and tubes appear to be in appropriate position except for a
 right Swan-Ganz catheter, which appears to be in the right main pulmonary
 artery.
 
 2. Appropriate position of the IABP.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at 9
 a.m. on the day of the exam.
