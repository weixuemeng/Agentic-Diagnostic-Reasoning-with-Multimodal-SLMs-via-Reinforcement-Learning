 INDICATION:  Fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  At the right base, there is a linear patchy opacity most consistent
 with atelectasis.  This is not significantly changed from the prior exam. 
 There is no new consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Mild cardiomegaly
 is unchanged.  A rounded calcification is noted in the right upper quadrant
 subcutaneous tissue, possibly a calcified fibroma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
