                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope versus seizure, vertigo.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Given this, there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  The aorta is
 slightly tortuous.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
