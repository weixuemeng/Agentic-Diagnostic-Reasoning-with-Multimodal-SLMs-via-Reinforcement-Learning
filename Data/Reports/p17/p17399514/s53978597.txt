                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal AP portable views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of altered mental
 status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable views of the chest are obtained.  There is severe
 thoracolumbar scoliosis.  Areas of bibasilar patchy opacity are seen, which
 could be due to underlying infection and/or aspiration.  There are also areas
 of scarring/atelectasis in the upper lobes bilaterally.  No prior is available
 for comparison.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Slight
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue,
 although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There are
 degenerative changes at the bilateral shoulder joints, right greater than
 left, not fully evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities could be due to chronic aspiration,
 although underlying infectious process is not excluded.  Bilateral upper lobe
 areas of linear atelectasis/scarring.
