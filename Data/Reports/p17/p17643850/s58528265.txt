 eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung
 volumes.  Atelectatic changes are again seen in the mid zones bilaterally as
 well as at the bases. The area of questioned opacification in the infrahilar
 region on the right is unchanged. Again this could represent merely
 atelectatic changes, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
