                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, fevers, possible pneumonia.  //
 cough, fevers, pod1 from R BKA, concern for infection.      cough, fevers,
 pod1 from R BKA, concern for infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, a dense area of platelike
 atelectasis is again seen in the left mid zone with smaller streaks at the
 base. Areas of atelectasis are also seen on the right.  There is the
 suggestion of an ill-defined area of increased opacification adjacent to the
 descending portion of the right pulmonary artery. Although this could also
 merely represent atelectatic change, in the appropriate clinical setting
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
