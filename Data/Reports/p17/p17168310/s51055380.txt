                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new O2 requirement, evaluate for acute
 pulmonary process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar platelike
 atelectasis.  Linear opacity projecting above the left hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged from prior studies and likely represents chronic scarring.  There is
 no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volunes, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
