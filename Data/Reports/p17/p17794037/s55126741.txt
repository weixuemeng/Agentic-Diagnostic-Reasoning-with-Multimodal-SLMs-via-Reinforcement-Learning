                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness and dizziness. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and clear lungs which are hyperinflated, without focal
 consolidation.  A 4 mm focal area of nodularity is seen in the left lung apex
 and may be inflammatory, although a parenchymal nodule cannot be excluded. The
 bilateral hemidiaphragms are flattened. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. A 4 mm focal area of nodularity in the left lung apex may be inflammatory,
 although a parenchymal nodule cannot be excluded.  Comparison to prior studies
 would be helpful, but if not available, a CT chest or 3 month followup chest
 radiograph can be obtained.
