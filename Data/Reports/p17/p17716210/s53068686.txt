 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter and spinal
 stimulator wires are again demonstrated.  A catheter is also noted projecting
 over the right lung base, unchanged. Multiple clips are again seen in the
 right upper quadrant.  No displaced fractures are identified.

 No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced fractures are seen.  If there
 is continued concern for rib fracture, then a dedicated rib series is
 suggested.
