                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  There is a left
 lower lobe retrocardiac opacity which could represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is also an adjacent linear area of
 opacification in the left lung base and linear opacities in the right lung
 base likely representing atelectasis.  The previously seen spinal stimulator
 is unchanged in position since the prior study.  There is no evidence of
 pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity could represent pneumonia in
 the appropriate clinical setting.  Bibasilar linear atelectasis is also
 present.
