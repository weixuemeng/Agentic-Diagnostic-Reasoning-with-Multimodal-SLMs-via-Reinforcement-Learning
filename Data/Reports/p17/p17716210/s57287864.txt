                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with recent right femoral Hickman replacement
 for chronic TPN, here to evaluate Hickman placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement of a
 Hickman catheter coursing above the diaphragm.  The tip of the line is not
 well visualized due to technique, but appears to project over the atrium.  A
 repeat radiograph with abdominal technique could be considered to confirm this
 finding.  
 
 A gastrostomy catheter is again seen below the diaphragm terminating in the
 left upper quadrant.  A spinal stimulator device is unchanged in appearance. 
 The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, which may be related to poor
 inspiratory effort.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___by phone at
 3:45pm on ___.
