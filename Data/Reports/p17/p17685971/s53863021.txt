 HISTORY:  Patient with asthma, assess for evidence of right or left heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 seen.  There is stable leftward tracheal deviation, unchanged from prior
 study.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 2.  Stable leftward tracheal deviation, likely reflective of right thyroid
 lobe enlargement.
