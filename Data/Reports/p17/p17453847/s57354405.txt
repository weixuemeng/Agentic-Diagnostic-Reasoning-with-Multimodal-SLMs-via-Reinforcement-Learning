 inspiration, and patient position.  Lateral right pleural thickening is re-
 demonstrated.  No large pleural effusion seen.  Moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion with possible mild interstitial edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with possible mild interstitial edema,
 likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.
