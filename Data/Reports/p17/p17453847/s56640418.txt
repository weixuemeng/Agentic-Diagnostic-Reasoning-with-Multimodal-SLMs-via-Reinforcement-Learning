                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a ___-year-old man with shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___,
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs again demonstrate a left chest wall
 pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.  Faint retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, though
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Faint retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, although early
 pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting.
