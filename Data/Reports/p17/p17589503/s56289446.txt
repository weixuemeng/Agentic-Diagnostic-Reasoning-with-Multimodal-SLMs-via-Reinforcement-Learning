                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with SOB   CP  // Eval CHF   COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are unchanged. 
 Mild cardiomegaly with unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  There is no central
 vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema.
 No focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the right lateral
 costophrenic angle is likely due to pleural thickening.  No effusion on the
 left.  Large ossific density inferior to the left humeral head likely reflects
 an intra-articular body.  Multiple old right lateral rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
