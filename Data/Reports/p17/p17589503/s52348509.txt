                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:   ___F with shortness of breath and cough  // evaluation for
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs from ___ through ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged but stable in size from prior examinations.  The aorta
 is markedly tortuous, but overall similar in size and appearance to prior
 exams.  Lung volumes are somewhat low.  There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
 No pneumothorax.  Compared to the prior study, rightward tracheal bowing
 appears increased, most likely due to positioning and degree of inspiration.  
 Large ossific density inferior to the left humerus is again noted.  Right
 seventh rib fracture is re- demonstrated.  There is no pleural effusion.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
