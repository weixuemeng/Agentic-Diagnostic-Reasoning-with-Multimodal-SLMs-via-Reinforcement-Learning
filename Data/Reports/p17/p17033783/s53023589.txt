                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with stroke, intubation.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates 5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube
 terminates in the left upper quadrant.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the
 pulmonary vasculature and cardiac contour.  Accounting for this there is mild
 vascular congestion.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Standard position of endotracheal and enteric tubes.
