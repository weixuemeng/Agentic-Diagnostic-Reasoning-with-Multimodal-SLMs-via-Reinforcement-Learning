 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased secretions  // eval for interval
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study there is increased volume loss in the right lower
 lobe.  The opacity in the right lower lobe is felt to be secondary to volume
 loss although an early infiltrate can't be excluded.  There is pulmonary
 vascular redistribution with some hazy alveolar infiltrates most likely
 secondary to pulmonary edema.  The feeding tube and ET tube are unchanged
