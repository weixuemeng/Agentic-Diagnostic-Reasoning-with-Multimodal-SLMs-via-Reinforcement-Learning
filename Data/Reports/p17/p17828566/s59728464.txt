                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or a pneumothorax. 
 Patchy opacity refers to the left lower lobe, but elsewhere the lungs appear
 clear.  Small anterior osteophytes are noted along the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the left lower lobe.  Differential considerations
 include atelectasis, developing pneumonia or possibly aspiration in the
 appropriate setting.
