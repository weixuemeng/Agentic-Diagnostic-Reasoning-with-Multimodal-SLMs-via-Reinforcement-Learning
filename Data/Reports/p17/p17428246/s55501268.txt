                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:30 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman.  Evaluate PICC line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right PICC line has been withdrawn slightly, now with the tip projecting over
 the head of the right clavicle, now at the origin of the right brachiocephalic
 vein.  Previous interstitial edema, and mediastinal vascular engorgement have
 resolved, but new opacification at the base of the left lung could be due to
 substantial left lower lobe atelectasis, in addition to at least a
 small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.
