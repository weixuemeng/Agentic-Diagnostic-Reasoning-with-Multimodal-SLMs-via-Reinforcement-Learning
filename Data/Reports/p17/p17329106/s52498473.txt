                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and left shoulder blade pain.  Evaluate for
 acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs ___.  Multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since prior
 radiograph, the interstitial prominence is decreased, suggesting improvement
 in pulmonary edema.  Mild persistent interstitial prominence could be due to
 overlying soft tissue or mild residual pulmonary edema.  Linear opacities in
 the right mid lung zone are likely atelectasis.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal and unchanged from prior exams.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with possible mild persistent
 pulmonary edema.
