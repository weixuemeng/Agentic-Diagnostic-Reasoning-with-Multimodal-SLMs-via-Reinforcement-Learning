                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP UPRIGHT:  Patient position is not specified.  The patient is rotated
 rightward, if the patient is also supine, that would explain enlargement of
 the right hilus. Mild volume loss in the right lung and possible asymmetry in
 the extent of peripheral vascularity need to be verified with carefully
 positioned radiographs to see if imaging possible pulmonary embolus is
 indicated.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise normal.  There
 is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Need repeat radiographs to evaluate indirect signs of acute
 pulmonary embolus. Dr ___ was paged at 9:00AM.
