                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough x3 weeks and left picc line.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Lung volumes are slightly low.
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  No
 pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Linear and patchy opacities within the lung
 bases, as well as along the fissure in the right upper lobe, are minimally
 worse in the interval. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however
 the right lung apex is obscured due to the patient's neck and chin projecting
 over this region. Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases as well as right upper lobe linear opacity
 along the fissure, slightly worse in the interval. Findings likely reflect
 atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded. Left PICC tip in
 unchanged position in the upper SVC.
