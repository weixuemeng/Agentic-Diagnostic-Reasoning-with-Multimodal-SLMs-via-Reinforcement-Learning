                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of dyspnea.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph was provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly low.  There is no large focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. 
 Linear opacity in the right midlung is stable from prior radiographs and may
 represent atelectasis or scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 There are no overt signs of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant change since the prior radiograph.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
