                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 AP radiograph was reviewed in comparison to prior study from ___
 done at 11:17 a.m.
 
 The positioning of the patient is suboptimal.  Within those limitations, there
 is no substantial change in the right lower lung and left basal opacities that
 might reflect areas of atelectasis but infectious process cannot be excluded. 
 Repeated radiograph is indicated.
