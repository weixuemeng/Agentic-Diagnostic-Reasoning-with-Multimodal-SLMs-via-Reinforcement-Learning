                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:  The initial report of this radiograph noted a right upper lobe lung
 nodule.  It should have said that this abnormality was new since conventional
 radiographs four days earlier and as such is not concerning for malignancy,
 and instead might have been an infectious nodule.  It is in fact an external
 artifact of the EKG lead fixed to the right upper chest.  No followup
 radiograph is indicated, presuming the patient is not manifesting any clinical
 findings of pulmonary infection.
