                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with overdose // confirmation of ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 00:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip terminating
 approximately 5.8 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube tip appears to be
 within the stomach.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Worsening streaky
 opacities in the lung bases bilaterally most likely reflect increased
 atelectasis, although aspiration remains a concern.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is continued elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Standard positioning of the endotracheal and enteric tubes.  Worsening
 bibasilar streaky opacities which may reflect increased atelectasis or
 aspiration.
