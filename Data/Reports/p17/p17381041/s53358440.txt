                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right lung wedge resection with stable
 postoperative scarring and volume loss.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 Healed left rib fractures are unchanged.  Mild compression deformity in mid
 thoracic spine is also similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest, with no conventional
 radiographic evidence to suggest pulmonary metastases.  CT would be more
 sensitive for detecting small pulmonary nodules.
