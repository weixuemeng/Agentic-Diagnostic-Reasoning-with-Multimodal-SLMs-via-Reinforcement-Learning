                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of COPD, now presenting with
 altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___ and cervical spine CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There are diffuse reticular
 opacities with blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles on the lateral
 view.  Findings are similar compared to chest radiograph from a few days prior
 and similar to multiple prior examinations.  Mild cardiomegaly overall appears
 unchanged.  Though this has previously been described as pulmonary edema, the
 stability over several radiographs, suggests this could be secondary to
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  No definite superimposed confluent
 consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unchanged from prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse reticular opacities with blunting of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles, similar to multiple prior examinations.  Though this
 could reflect pulmonary edema in the appropriate clinical setting, findings
 may reflect underlying chronic interstitial lung disease.
