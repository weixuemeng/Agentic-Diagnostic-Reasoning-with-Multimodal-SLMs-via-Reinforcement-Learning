                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There
 is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles on the lateral view,
 which may be due to hyperinflated lungs and scarring, although trace pleural
 effusions are not excluded.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. 
 The aorta is tortuous/unfolded.  Prominence of the interstitium and pulmonary
 vessels is again seen as seen on the prior study from ___ which may be
 due to mild pulmonary edema.  Left basilar linear opacity more likely reflects
 atelectasis rather than consolidation.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  There is
 severe compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body, grossly stable as
 compared to ___.  Degenerative changes are again seen at the left
 shoulder and acromioclavicular joints and partially imaged at the right
 shoulder joint.
