                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall.  On further review of the medical record, the patient has
 altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 FRONTAL and LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart remains mildly enlarged. 
 There is a tortuous and calcified aorta.  No pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation.  Prominence of the interstitium and central vessels is thought
 to reflect mild pulmonary edema.   Blunting of the costophrenic angles may
 represent small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 Severe degenerative changes of the shoulder and neck are noted.  There is a
 severe compression deformity of a vertebral body within the mid thoracic spine
 which is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
