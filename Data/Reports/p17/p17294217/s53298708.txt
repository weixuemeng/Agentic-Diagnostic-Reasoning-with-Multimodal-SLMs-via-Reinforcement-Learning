                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, with mental status changes.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top
 normal in size.  There is a tortuous aortic knob with calcification.  In the
 lateral view, there is a lenticular opacity in the posterior lung bases,
 likely the left lung base.  There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. 
 There is marked dextroconvex thoracolumbar scoliosis.  There is eventration of
 the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 A severe compression deformity is noted in the mid thoracic spine, of
 uncertain age but likely chronic.  There is no gross malalignment.  The
 osseous structures are diffusely osteoporotic.  There is significant
 shortening of the acromiohumeral distance bilaterally, representing rotator
 cuff injuries.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  A small opacity in the posterior lung base (likely the left lung base),
 non-specific but could represent a small loculated pleural effusion. 
 Differential diagnosis includes focal consolidation, atelectasis, but cannot
 exclude neoplastic process.  Recommend follow-up chest radiograph to ensure
 clearance or otherwise chest CT.
 
 2.  Diffuse osteopenia with a severe mid-thoracic compression deformity,
 likely chronic.
