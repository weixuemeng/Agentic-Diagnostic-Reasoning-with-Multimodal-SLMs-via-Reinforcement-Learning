                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia on prior portable chest radiograph,
 further assessment requested.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Patient
 is slightly rotated to her left in the frontal projection, which limits the
 evaluation.  Though allowing for this, there is no definite evidence for
 pneumonia or CHF.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears normal.  Bony structures are intact.  Again noted is a
 small ossific density adjacent to the left distal clavicle that may reflect an
 old injury.
