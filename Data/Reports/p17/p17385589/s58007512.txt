 atelectasis or pneumonia.  The heart is not enlarged.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and opacity at the left base which may reflect
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Convenitonal AP and lateral radiographs as soon as
 feasible would be helpful to clarify this finding. 
 
 Updated results were telephoned to ___ by ___ at 9:40 am,
