                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, status post extubation, please evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable upright chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the previous examination, the endotracheal tube, nasogastric
 tube, and right internal jugular venous access catheter have been removed. 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Left basilar/retrocardiac opacity is probably
 minimally progressed, and air bronchograms previously seen in this region are
 no longer visualized which may indicate a degree of mucous plugging.  There is
 increased right retrocardiac opacity suggestive of increased atelectasis
 and/or consolidation.  However, no evidence of interstitial edema.  Osseous
 structures appear unchanged.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the soft
 tissues of the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of lines and tubes.  Increased bibasilar
 opacities suggestive of atelectasis and/or consolidation.
