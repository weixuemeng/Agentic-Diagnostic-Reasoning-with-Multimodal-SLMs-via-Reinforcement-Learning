                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypothermia, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left lower lobe moderate atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged with possible
 small pleural effusion.  Right lower lung opacities have increased which could
 be atelectasis or pneumonia.  The patient has a right-sided pectoral with
 pacemaker with three leads, one in atrium and two in right ventricle.  Severe
 cardiac enlargement is stable.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation is unchanged.
 2.  Mild right lower lung opacities have increased and could be compatible
 with atelectasis or pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.
