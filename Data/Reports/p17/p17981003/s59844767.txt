                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia after neck exploration, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette shown to reflect pericardial effusion. 
 There is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure with increasing right
 pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with pleural
 effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  The possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Pacer device remains in place and there is evidence of previous left
 axillary dissection.
 
 Displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left is presumably related
 to recent surgery in the region.
