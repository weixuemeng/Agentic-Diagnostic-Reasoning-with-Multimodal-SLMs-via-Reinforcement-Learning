                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative pneumonia versus heart failure, for OGT position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of an OG tube that extends well into the distal stomach. 
 Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5.1 cm above the carina.
 
 The lung volumes are substantially improved.  This may account for the
 apparent improvement in pulmonary vascularity, which now is essentially within
 radiographic limits of normal.
