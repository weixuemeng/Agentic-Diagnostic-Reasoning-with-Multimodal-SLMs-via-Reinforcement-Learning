                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dCHF here w/ fatigue and vague complaints.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low limiting evaluation. The heart size appears grossly
 stable allowing for slight differences in technique. There is prominence of
 the right pulmonary hilum which is of unclear etiology. Mild ground-glass
 opacity is seen within the lungs which could reflect a component of mild
 edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The mediastinal contour
 appears unchanged. No bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominence of the right pulmonary hilum, possibly due to technique with mild
 diffuse ground-glass opacity in the lungs suggesting pulmonary edema. Consider
 dedicated PA and lateral views to better assess.
