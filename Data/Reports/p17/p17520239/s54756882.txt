  No acute intrathoracic process. Large right hilar mass seen on prior study as
  well as right lung nodule are unchanged in appearance. No evidence of overt
  pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal
  and hilar contours stable. Increased streaky opacity within the left lower
  lung zone is thought reflective of atelectasis.
