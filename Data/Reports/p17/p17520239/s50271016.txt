                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  New metastatic malignancy.  Presenting with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  There is a large right hilar mass since the
 prior study as well as a new nodule in the right lung worrisome for perhaps a
 primary or metastatic focus of malignancy.  Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear.
 There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with malignancy including suspicious right upper lobe
 nodule and marked right-sided perihilar lymphadenopathy.  Chest CT is
 recommended to evaluate further when clinically appropriate.
