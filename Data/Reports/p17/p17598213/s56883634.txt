                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dyspnea, pleural effusion, recent admission to
 ___ w/ PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small, right greater than left.  There is a
 large bleb in the right upper lung.  Irregular opacity in the right mid to
 lower lung is most likely indicative of scarring though in the absence of
 prior imaging studies, other etiologic considerations are difficult to
 exclude.  There is mild left basal atelectasis.  Heart size appears
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contour cannot be assessed.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, small, right greater than left with ill-defined
 opacity in the right lower lung most consistent with scarring though difficult
 to exclude pneumonia.  Large bleb in the right upper lung.
