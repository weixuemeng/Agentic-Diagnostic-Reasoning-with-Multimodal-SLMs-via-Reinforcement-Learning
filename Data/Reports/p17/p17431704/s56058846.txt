                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which is
 likely mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with likely mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild bibasilar
 atelectasis is noted.  There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.  Partially imaged is a left humeral head prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt
 pulmonary edema.
