 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough, fever, hypoxia and tachycardia, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  Lung volumes are
 low which limits evaluation.  Allowing for this, there is no focal
 consolidation or definite signs of effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 appears top normal, though this may be due to portable AP technique.  The
 mediastinal contour is stable.  No bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, negative.
