 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with ___'s and UTI, now with fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest were obtained with the patient
 in the upright position.  These images are extremely limited due to
 underpenetration.  There is no evidence seen of a new pneumonia.  Heart size
 is unchanged and within normal limits.  There is some elongation of the
 thoracic aorta but no local abnormalities.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  A prosthesis is seen in the left humerus.  Soft tissue consistent
 with morbid obesity is identified which limits exam interpretation due to
 underpenetration.  The lateral image shows there is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of a new pneumonia on this extremely limited exam.
