                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and leukocytosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  No strong evidence of pneumonia is identified, though low lung
 volumes limit evaluation of the bases, particularly on the left.  No pleural
 effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged with tortuosity of the aorta and top normal heart
 size.  A previously seen right-sided PICC has been removed.  A left humeral
 prosthesis is partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No strong evidence of pneumonia, though evaluation at the bases,
 particularly on the left is limited due to low lung volumes.  PA and lateral
 radiographs are recommended.
