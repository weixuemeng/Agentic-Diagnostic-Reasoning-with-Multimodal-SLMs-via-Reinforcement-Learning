                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST EXAM OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left subclavian porta catheter remains in standard position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change.  Lungs
 are clear except for a focal linear area of atelectasis at the left lung base.
 Questionable small left pleural effusion manifested by slight blunting of
 lateral left costophrenic sulcus.  Pleural surfaces are otherwise clear.  No
 acute skeletal findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic findings to suggest gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity.
 However, high-resolution chest CT would be more sensitive and may be
 considered for more complete assessment if clinical suspicion for this entity
 persists.
 2.  Focal left lower lobe linear atelectasis and possible small pleural
 effusion.
