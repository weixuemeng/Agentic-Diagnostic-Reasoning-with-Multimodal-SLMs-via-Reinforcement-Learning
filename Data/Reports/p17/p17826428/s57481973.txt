 FINDINGS: 
 
 A patchy opacity in the left lower lobe may reflect atelectasis. The right
 lung appears clear. A PICC terminates in the upper SVC. Cardiac size remains
 normal. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Scoliosis again
 noted.

 Left lower lobe patchy opacity, likely atelectasis but developing pneumonia is
