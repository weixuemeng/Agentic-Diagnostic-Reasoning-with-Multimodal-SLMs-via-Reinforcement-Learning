                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:05 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a poor baseline mental status and new fever
 to 103 Fahrenheit.  Question aspiration or other pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower on the current study which serves to exaggerate
 pulmonary vascular caliber and the abnormal background interstitium of the
 lungs present on prior studies.  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal veins
 may be dilated.  I would recommend repeat conventional radiographs as soon as
 feasible to see if the vascular abnormalities and interstitial edema are
 genuine, and to evaluate the left lung apex, which shows greater opacity
 medially than the right.  All of these findings could be artifacts of low lung
 volume.
