                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with worsening respiratory status, crackles
 throughout on exam
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 09:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph, the left lower lobe opacities have
 perhaps slightly improved suggesting that this is due to atelectasis rather
 than pneumonia. The remainder of the exam remains unchanged with a right-sided
 PICC terminating in the upper SVC. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
 No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis, perhaps slightly improved from prior. No other
 relevant change identified.
