                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with right-sided hemorrhagic basal
 ganglia stroke with intraventricular extension, midline shift, hydrocephalus,
 status post EVD placement, presenting with fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Right PICC
 line tip terminates in lower SVC. An enteric tube projects over the expected
 location of the stomach, tip is not included in this examination. Lung volumes
 remain low. There is interstitial edema, mild in the right hemithorax and more
 prominent on the left, likely asymmetric edema.  There is evidence of cardiac
 decompensation with dilation of azygos vein and pulmonary vessels.  There is
 no definite pneumothorax. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, interval worsening of left perihilar opacity is concerning for pneumonia
 or aspiration. This finding however, may also be related to asymmetric edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Worsening left perihilar opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
 This finding  may also be related to asymmetric edema.  Close monitoring is
 recommended.
 
 2. Evidence of cardiac decompensation with dilation of azygos vein and
 pulmonary vessels.
 
 Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone
