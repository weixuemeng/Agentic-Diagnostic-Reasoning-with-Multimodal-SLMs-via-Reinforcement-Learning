                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation.  History of intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier radiograph from the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable semi-upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient remains intubated.  An orogastric tube passes into the
 stomach and crosses into the right lower quadrant.  It probably terminates in
 the distal antrum.  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a patchy retrocardiac opacity with
 air bronchograms, somewhat improved, and veil-like opacity, potentially a
 small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left basilar opacity and possible effusion, similar to somewhat
 improved.  Pneumonia is difficult to exclude, although the location of opacity
 and circumstances are typical for atelectasis.
