                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position,
 and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for lower
 lung volumes.  Persistent to slightly worsening left retrocardiac opacity,
 which probably represent a combination of atelectasis and adjacent effusion. 
 No definite pneumothorax on the semi-upright study.
