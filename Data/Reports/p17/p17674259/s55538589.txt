                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post PEG.  New opacity of the left upper lobe on the
 previous chest x-ray, status post bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 1:02 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung is
 substantially better expanded.  Nevertheless, left blunting of the
 costophrenic sinus, presumably caused by a left pleural effusion, persists. 
 There also is atelectasis at the left lung bases.  Overall, low lung volumes. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral surgical clips.  Tracheostomy tube in situ.
