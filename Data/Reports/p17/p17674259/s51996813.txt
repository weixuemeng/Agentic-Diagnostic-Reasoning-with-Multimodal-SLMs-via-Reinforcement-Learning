                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of CVA,
 reintubated after recent extubation, assessment of the ET tube placement.
 
 As compared to ___, current AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 ET tube being 5.2 cm above the carina.  The right PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC.  Left retrocardiac opacity appears to be unchanged and
 concern for infection.  There is slight interval improvement of pulmonary
 edema.
