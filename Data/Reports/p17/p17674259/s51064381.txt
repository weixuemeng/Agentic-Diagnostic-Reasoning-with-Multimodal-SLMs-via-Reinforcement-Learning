                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, pneumonia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild fluid overload.  In addition, there is a large left
 retrocardiac opacity that could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia, or a
 combination of both.  No new parenchymal opacities have occurred in the
 interval.  No pneumothorax.
