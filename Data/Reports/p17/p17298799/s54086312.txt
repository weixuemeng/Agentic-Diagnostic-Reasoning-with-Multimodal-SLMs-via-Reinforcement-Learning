                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with cough  // r/o pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, left greater than right, which may
 reflect atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 The cardiac size is difficult to assess secondary to the patient's low lung
 volumes.  Calcifications are seen at the aortic arch.  Incidental note is made
 of an azygos lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than
 right, likely representing atelectasis, although pneumonia and aspiration
 should also be considered.
