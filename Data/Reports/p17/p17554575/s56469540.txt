                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizure yesterday. Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Tortuous and calcified aorta is again
 seen. Large hiatal hernia is also again noted, limiting evaluation of the
 medial lower lobes on the PA view and of the basal lower lobes on the lateral
 view.  Linear atelectasis is again seen in the right lower lobe adjacent to
 the hernia. No definite new pulmonary consolidation is identified. The lungs
 remain hyperinflated. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusion. The bones are demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable appearance of the chest without evidence for acute cardiopulmonary
 abnormalities. The large hiatal hernia limits evaluation of the lower lobes,
 as detailed above.
