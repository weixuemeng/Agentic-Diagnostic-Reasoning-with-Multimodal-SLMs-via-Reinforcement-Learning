                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, GERD, dyspnea, weakness, question
 infection or fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperlucent with widened AP diameter of the chest, suggesting underlying COPD.
 There is a large retrocardiac opacity which is slightly increased in size
 compared with the prior study and likely represents a large hiatal hernia. 
 There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  No signs of CHF. 
 Heart size appears stable.  Mediastinal contour reflects an unfolded thoracic
 aorta.  Bony structures are intact though demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia or CHF.  Large hiatal hernia.  COPD.
