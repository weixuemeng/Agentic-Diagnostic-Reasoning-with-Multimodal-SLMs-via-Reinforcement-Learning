 year old man with cough and bloody diarrhea. r/o pna.
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Lungs are clear except for a poorly
 defined 1 cm opacity in the right suprahilar region.  No pleural effusion.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1 cm right suprahilar opacity could potentially represent a very early focus
 of pneumonia in the setting of clinical suspicion for infection.  Standard PA
 and lateral chest radiograph would be helpful for confirmation and and further
 characterization when the patient's condition permits.  .
