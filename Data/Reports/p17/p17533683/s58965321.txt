                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia versus CHF.  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There are increased
 interstitial markings seen in the lungs bilaterally predominantly in a
 peripheral distribution.  On the lateral view, is more dense opacity overlying
 the spine inferiorly.  Superiorly the lungs are clear of confluent
 consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Median sternotomy
 wires and mediastinal clips are identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs with
 somewhat of a peripheral distribution.  While this could be due to edema,
 there is possibility of underlying chronic interstitial process.  More dense
 opacity projecting over the spine on the lateral view could represent
 infection or effusion.
