                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with Pneumothorax  // OG tube placement      OG
 tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the orogastric tube extends
 to the upper stomach.  The side-port is probably at or just above the
 esophagogastric junction and should be pushed forward at least 5 cm for more
 optimal positioning.
 Otherwise little change.
