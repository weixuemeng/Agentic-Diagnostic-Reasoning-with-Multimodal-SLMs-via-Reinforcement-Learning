                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:27 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with possible cardiogenic shock.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Vascular clips denote left hilar surgery.  Mediastinum is shifted entirely
 into the left hemithorax and the volume of aerated lung on the left is very
 small, smaller than I would expect if patient has had just a lower lobectomy. 
 Although I do not know the baseline appearance of the patient's chest
 radiograph, I suspect there is new collapse of the postoperative left lung. 
 Interstitial edema is seen in the hyperexpanded right lung.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Right subclavian line ends in the brachiocephalic vein.  There
 is no appreciable right pleural effusion, although there may be a small
 amount.
