                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with copd, lung ca s/p pneumonectomy  // please
 evaluate ETT placement after tube was pushed in
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph, there has been no interval change
 substantial left lung volume loss and associative leftward mediastinal shift. 
 The right lung is fairly hyperexpanded and crosses the thoracic midline. 
 Unchanged atelectatic changes in the right lung.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is not well assessed due to the significant mediastinal shift. 
 There is likely a small right pleural effusion.  The ET tube now terminates
 approximately 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube terminates within the
 stomach.  The left PICC line likely terminates in the cavoatrial junction
 however it is difficult to assess considering the degree of mediastinal shift.
 Stable mild thoracic scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.  Otherwise unchanged study.
