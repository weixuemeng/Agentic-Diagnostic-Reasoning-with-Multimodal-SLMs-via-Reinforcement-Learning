 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 a right pigtail catheter with apparent drainage of a large amount fluid from
 the right pleural space.  There may be a tiny apical pneumothorax.
 Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  There is now hazy opacification
 of the left hemithorax with obscuration hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 substantial layering pleural effusion on this side.
