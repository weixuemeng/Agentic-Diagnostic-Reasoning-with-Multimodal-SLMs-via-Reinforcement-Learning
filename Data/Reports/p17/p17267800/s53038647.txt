 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph from earlier today, a left internal jugular
 vascular sheath has been placed, terminating at the junction of the left
 internal jugular and left brachiocephalic veins.  A tiny left apical
 pneumothorax has apparently decreased in size since the recent radiograph.  No
 other relevant change.
