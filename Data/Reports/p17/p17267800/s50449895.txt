  1. Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 day earlier, there has been
  interval removal of the left-sided pigtail catheter.  Right-sided pigtail
  catheter, right PICC and enteric tube are unchanged.
  2. Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis.  No new
  consolidation.  Known left pleural effusion has decreased.  No pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p AVR/CABG p/w acute cholecystitis, gallstone panc, duo
 ulcer c/b UGI bleed s/p GDA/SPDA/IPDA embo c/b post duo perf, duo divertic
 bleed s/p exlap and repair  // post L pigtail d/c
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, right pigtail pleural
 catheter has changed slightly in position, and a small right apical
 pneumothorax is newly visible.  Interval removal of the left pleural catheter,
 with apparent decrease in size of left pleural effusion, difficult to compare
 due to positional differences between the exams.  No definite left
 pneumothorax.
