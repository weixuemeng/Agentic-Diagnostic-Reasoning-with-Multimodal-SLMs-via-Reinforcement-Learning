                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with congestion, fevers, low O2 sat  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Increased opacity in the right
 lower lung seen on the frontal view is not definitely seen on the lateral
 view, may represent atelectasis, however may represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity in the right lower lung is seen on the frontal view only,
 and may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 Repeat with deeper inspiration may be helpful for further assessment.
