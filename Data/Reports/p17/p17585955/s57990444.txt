                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM:
 
 This addendum completes the report from ___.
 
 The right lower lobe nodule, described on the examination from ___ is
 completely unchanged, compared to digitized outside hospital films from ___ and ___.  There is no growth or change in morphology of the
 nodule.  The density of the nodule suggests calcification.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with fever.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 There is a 7 mm well demarcated, partially calcified density, likely in the
 right middle lobe, and likely representative of a fibrous nodule. Lungs are
 otherwise clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  Visualized osseous structures are grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No findings suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 2.  7 mm well demarcated fibrous nodule in the right lung. In the abscence of
 prior studies, 3 month follow up is recommended to ascertain stability, at
 which time CT may be considered.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via telephone
 on ___ at 5:12 p.m., at time of discovery.
