                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ARDS and shock, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___, five hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of
 right and left parenchymal opacifications consistent with worsening fulminant
 multifocal pneumonia along with worsening pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 enlarged and is unchanged from the prior study.  The right internal jugular
 line remains in the upper SVC and the endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5
 cm above the level of the carina.  An NG tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm and out of view.  There has been interval removal of an esophageal
 temperature probe.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Worsening, severe, acute  pneumonia and concurrent pulmonary
 edema.
