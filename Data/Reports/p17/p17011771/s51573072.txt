 Additionally, small left pleural effusion is likely new and layering.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  There is, however, new crescentic lucency
 projecting under the right hemidiaphragm concerning for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 2. New crescentic lucency underneath the right hemidiaphragm discerning for
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 3. Malpositioned endotracheal tube with tip now at the carina.
 
 4. Worsening bilateral pulmonary opacities, left greater in the right which
 could reflect worsening pulmonary edema and/or aspiration.  Small left pleural
