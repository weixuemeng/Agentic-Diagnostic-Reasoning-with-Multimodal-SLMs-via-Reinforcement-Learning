 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:13 PM
  Significant worsening of bilateral lung opacities since the prior study done
  at noon and are worrisome for multifocal infection. Also asymmetric left upper
  lung volume loss, possibly due to superimposed atelectasis or loculated left
  pleural effusion. ETT 3.5 cm above carina (initial image shows ETT in the
  right main stem bronchus). R IJ CVL tip in the mid SVC. NG tube courses
  through the stomach and out of view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post ex lap.  Intubated with right CVL.
 Assessment for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiographs of the chest demonstrate worsening bilateral
 parenchymal opacifications since the prior study, which are worrisome for
 multifocal fulminant pneumonia.  There is also a component of pulmonary edema.
 The endotracheal tube is seen in the right mainstem bronchus, and subsequent
 image shows re-positioning of the endotracheal tube which is now 3.5 cm above
 the carina.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in standard
 position with distal tip in the mid SVC.  An NG tube is seen coursing through
 the stomach and out of view.  There is also an esophageal temperature probe
 present.  The heart is enlarged.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Significant worsening in bilateral parenchymal opacifications
 concerning for fulminant multifocal pneumonia.  Bilateral pulmonary edema is
 also present.
 
 The above findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 8 p.m.
