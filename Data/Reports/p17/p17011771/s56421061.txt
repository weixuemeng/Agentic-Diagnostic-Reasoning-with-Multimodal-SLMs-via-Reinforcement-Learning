                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Abdominal distention.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable upright AP chest radiograph is limited by low
 lung volumes which accentuates the pulmonary vasculature.  Right basilar
 opacity is likely due to atelectasis. Crowding of pulmonary vasculature is
 noted.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. 
 Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.  There is gaseous
 distention of colon and/or stomach in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes. Probable right basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Gaseous distention of stomach and / or large bowel in the left upper
 quadrant. Consider CT for further assessment. No free intraperitoneal air.
