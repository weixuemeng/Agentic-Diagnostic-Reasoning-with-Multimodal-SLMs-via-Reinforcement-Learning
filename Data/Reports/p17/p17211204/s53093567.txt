                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope with low-grade temperature, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 consolidation in the right upper lobe localizing to the posterior segment on
 the lateral view.  Findings are compatible with pneumonia.  In addition, there
 are subtle peripheral nodules predominantly seen in the right upper lung. 
 Recommend followup to resolution to ensure complete resolution with treatment.
 No pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 appear grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Consolidation in the right upper lobe posterior segment is most
 concerning for pneumonia.  Additional areas of nodularity in the right lung
 could also represent foci of infection and followup to resolution is advised
 to ensure complete resolution of these findings.
