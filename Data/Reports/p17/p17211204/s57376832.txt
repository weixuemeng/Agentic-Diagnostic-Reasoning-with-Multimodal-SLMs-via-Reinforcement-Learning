                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup right upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  Right upper lobe
 consolidation is unchanged.  Other nodular opacities in the right upper lobe
 at the periphery and ill-defined opacities in the left upper lobe are also
 stable.  There are no new lung abnormalities.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  Mild degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe consolidation, likely pneumonia.  Followup in
 six weeks is recommended after treatment to assess evolution.
