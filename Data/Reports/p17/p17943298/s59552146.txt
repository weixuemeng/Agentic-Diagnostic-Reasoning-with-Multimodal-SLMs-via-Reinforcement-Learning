 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Failure to thrive, cough, large amount of phlegm,

 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Per the
 radiology technologist, patient was unable to completely listen to commands
 and co-operate.  Given this, there is bibasilar atelectasis.  Patchy left base
 opacity may relate to atelectasis, although consolidations and developing
 infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis.
