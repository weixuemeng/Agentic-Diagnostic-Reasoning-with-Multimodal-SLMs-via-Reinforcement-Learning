 INDICATION:  Two months of productive cough in a patient with Down's syndrome.

 corresponds to an opacity overlying the heart on the lateral view.  The lungs
 are otherwise clear and the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion and the pulmonary vascularity is
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right middle lobe pneumonia.
 
 NOTE:  Findings were entered into the critical results reporting database
 after a phone call to the supplied number and page of the covering clinician
 went unanswered.
