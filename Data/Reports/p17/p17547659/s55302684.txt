                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pain and pop in chest, question fracture or pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lungs are clear
 and hyperinflated without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 
 Given the hyperinflation and slight coarsening of reticular markings in the
 lungs, the likelihood of underlying emphysema is raised.  A lucency along the
 medial right upper lung could reflect a large bulla.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. 
 Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Emphysema with prominent bulla in the right upper lung.  No signs
 of fracture or pneumothorax.
