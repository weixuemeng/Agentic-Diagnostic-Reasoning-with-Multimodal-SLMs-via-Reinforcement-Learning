                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD and aspiration PNA with ongoing
 tachypnea and bronchospasm  // interval change; volume status     interval
 change; volume status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are low lung
 volumes.  Probably little change in the degree of vascular congestion. 
 Increasing opacification in the left infrahilar region is consistent with the
 clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.  The right lung is essentially
 clear.
