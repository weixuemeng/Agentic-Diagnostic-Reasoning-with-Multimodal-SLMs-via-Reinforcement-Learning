 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar platelike subsegmental atelectasis is seen.  There is slight
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to atelectasis but
 trace pleural effusion is not excluded.  No definite focal consolidation is
 seen.  The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive
 pulmonary disease.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.

 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be
 due to atelectasis versus a trace pleural effusion.  No definite focal
 consolidation.
