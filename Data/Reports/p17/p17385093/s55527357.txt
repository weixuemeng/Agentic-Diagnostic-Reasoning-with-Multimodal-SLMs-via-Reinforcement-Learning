                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with diarrhea, abdominal pain and distention,
 rebound  // r/o free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are relatively hyperinflated.  Linear left base atelectasis/scarring
 is seen.  There is also a relative linear opacity projecting over the lateral
 right upper lung which may be due to scarring, however, this could be further
 assessed on dedicated chest CT.  There is no pleural effusion.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  No
 evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.
