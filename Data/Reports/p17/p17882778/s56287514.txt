                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with concern for aspiration PNA.  // Please
 assess for evidence of PNA.      Please assess for evidence of PNA.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with dual-channel pacer device in good
 position.  Engorgement of poorly defined pulmonary vessels is consistent with
 pulmonary edema. There is more coalescent opacification at the right base.
 Although this could represent merely asymmetric pulmonary edema, in view of
 the clinical history the possibility of aspiration pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered. Indeed, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia on the
 left could also be possible.
