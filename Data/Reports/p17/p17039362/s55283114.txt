                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___ WITH COMPARISON RADIOGRAPH OF
 EARLIER THE SAME DAY
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  New patchy
 opacities have developed in the right perihilar and left retrocardiac regions,
 with otherwise clear lungs, and no evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 No sternal or parasternal abnormality detected but positioning is subotpimal
 on lateral view with arms overlying the sternal region.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapid development of multifocal patchy opacities, which could be
 due to multifocal aspiration, and less likely asymmetrical edema or a rapidly
 developing infection.  
 
 No sternal or parasternal abnormality detected on this limited study but
 dedicated sternal radiographs or CT would be much more sensitive.
