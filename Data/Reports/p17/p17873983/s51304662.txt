                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Chain sutures are demonstrated within the left upper lobe with
 architectural distortion and linear opacities reflective of scarring from
 prior surgery.  Linear opacity within the left lung base likely reflects
 atelectasis, and overall there is volume loss within the left hemithorax. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The right lung
 is clear.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is
 demonstrated.  Left rib cage deformity is compatible with prior surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Postsurgical changes in the left upper lobe and chest wall.  Small left
 pleural effusion.  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
