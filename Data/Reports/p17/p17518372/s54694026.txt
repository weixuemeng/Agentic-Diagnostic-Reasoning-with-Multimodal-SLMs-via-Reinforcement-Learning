                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous median sternotomy.  The heart
 is mildly enlarged, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities are present in both retrocardiac regions, right greater than left. 
 No pleural effusion or acute skeletal finding.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy bibasilar opacities, which may reflect patchy atelectasis,
 aspiration, or early infectious pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
