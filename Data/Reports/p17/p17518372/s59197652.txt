                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low lung
 volumes results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged, allowing for differences in lung volumes.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema is seen. The right hilum is slightly
 dense, which may be due to lung volumes. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. 
 2. Dense right hilum may be due to low lung volumes. Recommend repeat
 conventional PA and lateral radiographs for further evaluation once acute
 issues have resolved.
