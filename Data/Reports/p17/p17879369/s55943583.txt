 COMPARISON:  CT ___, CT abdomen ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Mild atelectasis at the left lung base
 with left hemidiaphragmatic elevation as seen on the prior CT may be due to
 gaseous distention of bowel. There is no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  A nodule in the right mid lung is better seen on
 the prior CT.  Calcified granulomas are noted in the left mid lung.   Cardiac
 silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.
