                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar
 contours are similar.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without
 overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacities are noted in the left lung base could
 reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild
 degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.  Multiple remote left-sided
 rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left basilar patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
