                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  First time seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes accentuated by bronchovascular markings.  However, given
 this, there is prominence and indistinctness of the hila bilaterally
 suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement at least.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  No definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extremely low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  Prominent and indistinct hila could in part relate to low lung
 volumes, although underlying pulmonary vascular congestion/edema may be
 present.  If patient able, suggest repeat with better inspiration.
