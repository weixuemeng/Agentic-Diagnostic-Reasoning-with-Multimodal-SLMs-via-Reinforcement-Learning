                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cirrhosis, altered mental status, cough and
 crackles on exam, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright semi-portable views of the chest were obtained. Heart is
 normal in size and cardiomediastinal contour is stable.    Increased bilateral
 opacities likely relate to accentuated pulmonary vasculature due to low lung
 volumes.  There is no focal consolidation. There is central venous
 engorgement, but no pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, accentuating pulmonary vascular markings; no
 pulmonary edema or consolidation.
