                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.
 
 The lung volumes are low which has resulted in vascular crowding and apparent
 prominence of the hilar vasculature.  There are no overt signs of pulmonary
 edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal but unchanged from the recent CT. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
