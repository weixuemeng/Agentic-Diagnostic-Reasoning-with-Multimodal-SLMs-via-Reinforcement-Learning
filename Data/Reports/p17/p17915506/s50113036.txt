                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with right lower lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.
 After chest tube removal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax after chest tube removal. 
 The remainder of the right lung remains well aerated.  Since the prior
 examination there is opacification demonstrated within the left lower lobe. 
 There is a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no evidence of left
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate right hydropneumothorax after chest tube removal; status post
 right lower lobectomy.
 2.  New patchy opacification within the left lower lobe may be due to acute
 aspiration or atelectasis. Recommend short-term interval followup to exclude
 development of pneumonia if infectious symptoms are present.
