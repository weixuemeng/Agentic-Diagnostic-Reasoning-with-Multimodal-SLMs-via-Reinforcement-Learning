 FINDINGS:  Worsening consolidative opacity in the right infrahilar region may
 potentially represent an evolving aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical setting.  Slight improvement in patchy and linear opacity at the left
 lung base.  Small pleural effusions are unchanged.  Left clavicular and left
 rib fractures are again demonstrated.
