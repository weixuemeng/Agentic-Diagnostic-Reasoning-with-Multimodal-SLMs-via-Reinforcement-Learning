                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with declining mental
 status and concern for worsening pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 There is interval development of pulmonary edema.  There is also progression
 of the right mid and lower lung consolidation that might be concerning for
 aspiration/atelectasis.  Tubes and lines are in unchanged position.  Bilateral
 effusion is most likely present.
