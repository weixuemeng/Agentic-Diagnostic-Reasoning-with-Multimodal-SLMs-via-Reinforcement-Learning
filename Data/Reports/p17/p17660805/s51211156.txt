 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Even allowing for low lung volumes, cardiac silhouette has probably
 slightly increased in size since the prior study, and is accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  New patchy and linear bibasilar opacities may
 reflect atelectasis or aspiration.  Note is also made of small pleural
 effusions.  Left rib fractures and left clavicular fracture are also
 demonstrated and have been more fully characterized on recent CT.
