                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New OG-tube. Evaluate placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 02:48.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, an orogastric tube has been placed. The tip is in the
 stomach. An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5.8 cm from the
 carina.  Unchanged retrocardiac and left basilar opacities are most consistent
 with atelectasis. The lung volumes are low. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is due to prominent mediastinal fat.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New orogastric tube with the tip in the stomach. Otherwise no change.
