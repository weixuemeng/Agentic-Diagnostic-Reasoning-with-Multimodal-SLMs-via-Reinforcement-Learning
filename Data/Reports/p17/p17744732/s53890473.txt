                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New intracranial hemorrhage, status post intubation. Evaluate
 endotracheal tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 00:35.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is present with the tip 6 cm from the carina.  The lung
 volumes are low. The left costophrenic angle is not included in the field of
 view.  A large dense retrocardiac opacity is most likely atelectasis. The
 lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The apparent
 widening of the mediastinum is due to prominent mediastinal fat.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Satisfactory positioning of the endotracheal tube, 6 cm from the carina.
 2.  Dense retrocardiac opacity, which is most likely atelectasis.
