                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pneumonia in ___.  Has there been
 complete resolution?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Chest radiographs in ___ reported to show pneumonia are not available at
 this location.  I see no indication of pneumonia.  A 2-cm long tubular opacity
 projecting over the right cardiophrenic sulcus could be a vessel seen
 partially on end.  I do not see a corresponding abnormality on the lateral
 view, but in order to exclude the possibility of an impacted bronchus, I would
 recommend shallow oblique views at maximal inspiration.
 
 Lungs are otherwise essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette augmented
 by fat deposition, has not changed since ___.  There is no evidence
 of central adenopathy or pleural abnormality.
