                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with L IPH with hypoxic respiratory failure ___
 HCAP  // interval change
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to ___, right-sided PICC at the cavoatrial junction.
 Weighted feeding tube with the tip in the body of the stomach.  Increasing
 left basal opacity and moderate left effusion.  Minimal subsegmental
 atelectasis in the right lung base.  Possible new nodular opacity with central
 cavitation in the right lower lobe.  No pneumothorax.  The cardiac mediastinal
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing left retrocardiac opacity and moderate left effusion.
 
 Possible new nodular opacity with central cavitation in the right lower lobe,
 probably due to superimposed vascular structures and costal cartilage
 mimicking a nodule.  Suggest initial follow-up with repeat radiograph to
 reassess this area.
