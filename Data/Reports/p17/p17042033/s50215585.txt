                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p subclvian stent and left upper extremity
 fasciotomy  // eval for infiltrates in patient with leukocytosis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.2 cm above the carina.  NG tube is
 present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying stomach.  Are right subclavian PICC
 line is present, tip overlying cavoatrial junction.
 
 Compared to ___, there is new opacity at the right lung base, not
 fully characterized on a single AP view.  The appearance the presence of
 atelectasis at the right lung base, possibly with an associated layering small
 right pleural effusion.  The possibility of underlying consolidation would be
 difficult to exclude.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for
 further assessment.  The left lung remains grossly clear, without focal
 infiltrate or effusion.  The upper and mid right lung is also grossly clear. 
 Surgical clips again noted at the level of the left hemidiaphragm.  The
 patient's ununited mid left clavicle fracture is noted.  In addition, a new
 stent drain now overlies the expected course of the subclavian vessel.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New opacity right lung base--?   Atelectasis and/or and a small amount of
 layering pleural fluid.  The possibility of underlying consolidation cannot be
 entirely excluded.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help for
 further assessment.
 2. PICC line tip at cavoatrial junction.
 3. New stent  (or less likely drain) seen in the region of the previously
 identified subclavian pseudoaneurysm.
