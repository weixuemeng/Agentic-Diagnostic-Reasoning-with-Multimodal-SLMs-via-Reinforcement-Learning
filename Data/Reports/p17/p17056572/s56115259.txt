 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD in respiratory distress  // Evaluate
 for pulmonary edema      Evaluate for pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is stable or slightly improved
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  The hemidiaphragms are more sharply
 seen.  This could be a manifestation of improved pleural effusion, or merely
 reflect a more upright position of the patient.  Little change in the left mid
 zone opacity, which again could reflect a combination of dependent edema and
 atelectasis, though aspiration and infection should be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
