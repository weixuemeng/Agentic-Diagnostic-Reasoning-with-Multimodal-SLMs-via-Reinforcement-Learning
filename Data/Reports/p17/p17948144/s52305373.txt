 AP and lateral chest radiographs. Moderate interstitial edema has developed.
 Additionally there is a 3.0 cm right perihilar opacity in the expected
 location of the right pulmonary artery or a hilar lymph node. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is mildly enlarged.

 Further evaluation with CT-Chest is recommended.
