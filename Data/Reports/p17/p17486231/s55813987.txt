                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient being evaluated before
 CABG.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are reviewed demonstrating mild cardiomegaly and
 prominence of the main pulmonary artery that might potentially reflect
 pulmonary hypertension.  Bibasal opacities are noted and might reflect
 infectious process.  On the other hand, it might be part of the interstitial
 engorgement seen in the perihilar areas that might reflect interstitial
 pulmonary edema, clinical correlation is advised.
