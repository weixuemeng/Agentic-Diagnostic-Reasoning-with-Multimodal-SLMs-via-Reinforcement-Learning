                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed 2.5 hours prior.
 
 Single portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was reviewed in comparison
 to the prior.  A new endotracheal tube's tip ends 6.5 cm above the carina. 
 The PICC line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  The lung
 volumes have increased and there is minimal improvement in vascular
 congestion, which is probably due to the intubation.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  Soft tissues and bones are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New endotracheal tube with tip ending 6.5 cm above the carina. 
 Slight improvement in pulmonary edema is probably due to recent intubation.
