                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 HISTORY:  Recent pelvic fracture and shoulder dislocation after motor vehicle
 collision.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The heart is normal in
 size.  Patchy calcifications are noted along the aortic arch.  There is also
 mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  A mildly bulging contour along the
 lower left mediastinum suggests hiatal hernia.  The right hemidiaphragm is
 moderately elevated.  Streaky overlying opacities at each lung base suggest
 minor atelectasis.  The upper mediastinum has mildly widened appearance,
 although this is probably within normal limits for the technique applied.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Apparent mediastinal
 widening, although probably within normal limits for technique.  Suspected
 hiatal hernia.  Correlation with outside imaging is recommended.  CT should be
 considered if prior radiographs are not available to show stability of this
 appearance and if the chest was not recently imaged following trauma using CT.
