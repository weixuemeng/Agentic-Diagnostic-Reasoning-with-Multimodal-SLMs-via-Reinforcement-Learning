                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Five days status post surgery with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Left lower lobe opacity and to a lesser extent lingular
 opacity seen, which could be due to atelectasis, although findings are
 concerning for consolidation due to pneumonia.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen, although a trace left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal,
 likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Left lower lobe and to a lesser extent
 lingular opacities raise concern for underlying pneumonia with possibly
 associated atelectasis.  No right pleural effusion.  Difficult to exclude
 trace left pleural effusion.
