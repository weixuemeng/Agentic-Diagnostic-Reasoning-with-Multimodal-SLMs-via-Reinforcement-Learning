                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with recurrent aspiration admitted for pneumonia.
 // Eval for worsening infiltrate.      Eval for worsening infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe bilateral pneumonia is symmetric enough, with an apparent perihilar
 increase, to raise question of pulmonary edema, but I think the abnormality is
 due to infection, since heart size is normal and there is no mediastinal
 vascular engorgement.  Pleural effusions are small, incidental.
 
 Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
 expected courses.
