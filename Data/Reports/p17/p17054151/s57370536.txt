                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again
 terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac,
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  A widespread interstitial
 abnormality has resolved.  However, there is an increase in retrocardiac
 opacification in the left lower lobe.  Particularly given the lack of
 generalized evidence for pulmonary edema and the focal nature of the opacity,
 pneumonia seems a likely etiology.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings concerning for pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
