                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hypertension and fever
 after intravenous fluid administration with persistent oxygen requirement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  The right internal jugular line has
 been discontinued.  There is interval development of vascular engorgement most
 likely consistent with pulmonary edema.  There is more focal right upper lobe
 opacity, most likely part of the edema, but focal consolidation cannot be
 excluded due to pneumonia.  Bilateral pleural effusions have increased.  Left
 lower lobe opacity has increased , most likely represents part of the edema,
 but infectious process is a possibility.  Re-assessment of the patient after
 diuresis is required.
