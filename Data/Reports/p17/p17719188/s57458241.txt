 Endotracheal tube appears to have its tip approximately 2.8 cm above the
 carinal.  Left subclavian central line is unchanged in position.  A feeding
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There
 is worsening perihilar and parenchymal airspace opacities, left greater than
 right, which most likely reflect moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  An
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  Clinical correlation is recommended. 
 No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
