 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:36 AM
  
  
  
  As compared to the examination from the same date bilateral alveolar opacities
  are increased throughout the right lung and possibly mildly decreased in the
  left midlung.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  An endotracheal
  tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea.  Enteric tube courses below the level
  of the diaphragm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M Afib on coumadin w/ h/o TIA now w/ Large L fronto-temporal
 IPH  // eval for change; dobhoff tube placement      eval for change; dobhoff
 tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:24
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 18:02 is submitted. 
 The right costophrenic angle and lateral chest wall are not included.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip
 in the distal SVC.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 3.7 cm above
 the carina.  There are fluctuating asymmetric parenchymal opacities, now right
 greater than left, favoring pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen,
 although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi
 supine technique.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
