                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M Afib on coumading w/ h/o TIA now w/ Large L fronto-temporal
 IPH  // post bronch      post bronch
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following bronchoscopy
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 opacifications persist though there may be some improvement since the prior
 study.  Again, this most likely represents multifocal pneumonia with some
 element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
