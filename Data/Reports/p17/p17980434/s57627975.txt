                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size appears similar, at least mild to moderately enlarged.  Aortic knob
 remains calcified.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema appears slightly
 improved compared to previous exam.  A moderate size left pleural effusion may
 be slightly increased in the interval.  Trace right pleural effusion is
 relatively similar.  Left basilar consolidative opacity persists with air
 bronchograms, which may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slight interval improvement in mild interstitial pulmonary edema with moderate
 size left and small right pleural effusions.  The left pleural effusion may be
 slightly increased in the interval.  Persistent left basilar consolidative
 opacity, possibly atelectasis but pneumonia is not excluded.
