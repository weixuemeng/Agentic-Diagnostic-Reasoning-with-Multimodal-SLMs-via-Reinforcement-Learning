                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a persistent small-to-moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion with patchy associated opacity probably due to
 atelectasis.  A trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded on the right.  Mild
 interstitial prominence suggests slight fluid overload including ___ B-type
 lines along the right costophrenic sulcus.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bones
 appear demineralized.  There is no definite evidence of injury.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion and persistent
 pleural effusion, but no definite evidence for injury.
