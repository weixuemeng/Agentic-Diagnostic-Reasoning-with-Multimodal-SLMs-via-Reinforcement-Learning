                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  On the upright images from the current study, there are moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. 
 Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with essentially
 normal pulmonary vasculature.  This raises the possibility of pericardial
 effusion or cardiomyopathy.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though supervening consolidation could
 be difficult to detect in the appropriate clinical setting.
