                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  Compared to
 the prior radiograph, there has now been interval worsening of interstitial
 opacities consistent with progressive pulmonary edema.  More dense parenchyma
 in the right lower lung may be more confluent edema; however, pneumonia cannot
 be excluded.  The heart remains enlarged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening pulmonary edema, particularly in the right lower lobe.
