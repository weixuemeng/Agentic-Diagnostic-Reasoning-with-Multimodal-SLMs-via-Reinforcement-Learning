                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of renal failure on hemodialysis, now with cough and
 shortness of breath.  Concern for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate moderate cardiomegaly
 and small bilateral pleural effusions.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
 distended and there is no interstitial edema.  Retrocardiac opacities likely
 represent bibasilar atelectasis.  However, an underlying pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions could represent
 volume overload in the proper clinical setting.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacities most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.
