                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a consolidation involving majority right lung.  This is
 likely due to a combination of consolidation and atelectasis.  Small masses
 within the consolidation cannot be excluded.  Plate-like atelectasis is noted
 at the left base.  There is a mild interstitial abnormality in the left lung,
 of uncertain significance.  The mediastinum is wide with several lobulations. 
 The heart size is normal.  There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right lung consolidation and atelectasis.  Small masses within this
 consolidation cannot be excluded.  Evaluation with a CT is recommended.
 2.  Enlarged lobulated mediastinum, possibly due to lymphadenopathy or an
 underlying mass.  Again, further evaluation with a CT of the chest is
 recommended.
