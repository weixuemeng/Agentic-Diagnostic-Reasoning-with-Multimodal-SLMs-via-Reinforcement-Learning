                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:15 A.M. ON ___
 
 Pneumonia, sepsis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild edema in the left lung has worsened and new consolidation at the base
 could be developing pneumonia although dependent edema and atelectasis would
 explain the change.  Major progression in the chest is in the right hemithorax
 where a large relatively homogeneous opacity has grown and developed
 relatively sharp margins with the normal lung.  There has also been a
 substantial increase in the severity of consolidation in the lower lung. 
 Suspect there are three processes, worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema and
 loculated (probably fissural) pleural effusion, and concurrent pneumonia in
 the right mid and/or lower lung zone.  Though the heart is not grossly
 enlarged it is bigger today and so is caliber of mediastinal veins.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.
 
 In this case I think chest CT scanning would be extremely helpful to localize
 possible purulent pleural collections as well as determining the likelihood of
 concurrent pneumonia and edema, if that is in doubt.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings and recommendations by telephone.
