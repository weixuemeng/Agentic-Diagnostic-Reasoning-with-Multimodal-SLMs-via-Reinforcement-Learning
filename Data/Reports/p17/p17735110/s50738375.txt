                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with severe bilateral pneumonia/ARDS, to
 evaluate endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 4 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube ends
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Right internal jugular central venous
 catheter ends in the cavoatrial junction.  A nasogastric tube courses through
 the stomach and out of view.  Heterogeneous areas of parenchymal
 consolidations in both lungs are unchanged. Previously described right mid
 lung lucency is less well visualized in the current study.  Mild improvement
 of the superimposed mild edema.  A small right pleural effusion is likely
 present.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip 4 cm above the carina.
 2.  Multifocal consolidations, appear similar.  Mild improvement in the
 pulmonary edema.
