                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with bradycardia and hypotension  // eval for pneumonia, CHF
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are low limiting
 assessment.  Subtle perihilar opacities likely represent bronchovascular
 crowding though difficult to exclude a component of mild congestion.  No
 definite signs of pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size appears
 within normal limits.  The mediastinal contour is normal.  The bony structures
 are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perihilar opacity and bronchovascular crowding though difficult to exclude a
