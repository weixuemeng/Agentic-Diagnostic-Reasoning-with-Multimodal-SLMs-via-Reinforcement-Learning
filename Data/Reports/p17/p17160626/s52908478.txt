                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with dyspnea, cough, and history of coronary
 artery disease.  Suspect pneumonia or CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion is new.  Cardiac silhouette is
 partially obscured by pacer device, exaggerated on the frontal projection, but
 the lateral view shows there has been at least a modest increase in heart
 size.  Opacification in the left lower lobe at the lung base medially could be
 atelectasis alone.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads
 are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
