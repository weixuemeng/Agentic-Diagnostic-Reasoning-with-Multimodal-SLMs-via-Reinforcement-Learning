                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post laparoscopic hysterectomy with fever and
 shortness of breath.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
 Bibasilar opacities are most likely atelectases, but pneumonia cannot be
 totally excluded.  There is pneumoperitoneum, expected after surgery.  There
 is a nodular opacity in the right mid lung.  This could be superimposition of
 normal structures, but when pleural effusions and atelectases resolve, this
 should be reevaluated to exclude a lung nodule.
