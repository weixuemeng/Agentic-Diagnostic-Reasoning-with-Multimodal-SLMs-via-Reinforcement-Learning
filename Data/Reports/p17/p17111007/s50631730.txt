 morning
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___.
 
 Left lung is clear.  Small nodular opacity projects over the anterior aspect
 right fourth rib.  This could be the margin of the small region of atelectasis
 or pneumonia.  If possible I would repeat frontal chest radiographs, in the
 radiology Department if possible, at full inspiration to see if it persists
 before assuming that it is clinically significant.  Small right pleural
 effusion may be present.
 
 Heart size top-normal.  No pneumothorax.
