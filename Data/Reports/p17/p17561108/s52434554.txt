                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, status post two cycles of
 anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, status post recent aortic valve
 replacement.  Hospitalized recently with pneumonia.  Complaining of worsening
 shortness of breath with activity, O2 saturations at ___%.  Please assess
 for changes compared to ___ chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recently
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Midline sternotomy wires are intact.  A prosthetic cardiac valve is
 again noted.  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the upper SVC.  Linear opacities at
 the right lung base likely represent atelectasis or scarring from prior
 thoracic surgery.  The previously identified subtle opacity in the RUL is no
 longer seen.  There are no new air space consolidations to suggest infection.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.  An old rib fracture of
 the left seventh rib and partial resection of the right fifth rib is again
 noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidations to suggest infection.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at
 12:00 p.m. on ___.
