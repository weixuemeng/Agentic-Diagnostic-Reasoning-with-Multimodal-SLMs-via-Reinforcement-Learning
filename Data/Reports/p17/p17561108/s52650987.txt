                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Large loculated right pleural effusion appears similar to the
 recent study with dominant 7.5 cm loculated component laterally in the right
 mid-to-lower hemithorax.  Adjacent area of contiguous pleural fluid extending
 to the right mediastinal contour has slightly improved, however. 
 Circumferential right pleural opacity which likely represents a combination of
 pleural thickening and fluid is otherwise unchanged.  Volume loss persists in
 the right hemithorax.  Heart remains enlarged and there is persistent
 mediastinal widening on the right.  Left lung is grossly clear, and there is
 no evidence of left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight decrease in large right loculated pleural effusion,
 possibly due to hemothorax given provided clinical history.
