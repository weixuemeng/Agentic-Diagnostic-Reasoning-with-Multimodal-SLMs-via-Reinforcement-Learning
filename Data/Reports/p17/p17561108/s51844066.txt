                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of lymphoma who developed
 pneumonitis s/p chemotherapy, who presents for evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___,
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been an interval increase in the right pulmonary vascular
 congestion and pulmonary edema.  There has been a slight increase in opacity
 over the right lower lobe compared to the prior exam.  The left lung is clear.
 There is a background of chronic interstitial abnormality.  There are no
 significant pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged compared to multiple prior
 exams dating back to ___.  The hilar and mediastinal contours
 are otherwise unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires are stable, and patient is
 s/p AVR.  Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint is chronic.  There is a
 right-sided Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval increase in the right lower lobe opacification compared to the
 prior exam. This could be secondary to progression of pneumonitis, or if the
 patient is clinically presenting with cough/fever, could be secondary to an
 infectious etiology.
 
 2. Slight interval increase in right-sided pulmonary edema and pulmonary
 vascular congestion compared to the prior study.
