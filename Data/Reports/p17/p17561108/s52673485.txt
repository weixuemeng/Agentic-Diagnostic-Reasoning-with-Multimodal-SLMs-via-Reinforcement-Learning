 Portable upright chest on ___ at 21:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.  There are
 stable postoperative changes in right hemithorax with overall reduction in the
 volume of the right lung and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Left lung
 remains somewhat hyperexpanded.  The subtle reticulonodular interstitial
 process involving both upper lobes, previously described on prior study of
 ___ is still present and could reflect drug-related pneumonitis or an
 acute atypical infectious process.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No
 evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stably enlarged status post median sternotomy.  There is an old left seventh
 posterolateral rib fracture.  A right-sided rib resection is also seen.  No
 acute bony abnormality.
