                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent lung biopsy now with increased shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, 2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.  CT
 chest ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to ___, there is stable right-sided volume loss and
 pleural thickening.  There has been interval improvement previously seen
 scattered right-sided reticular opacities.  Blunting of the right
 cardiophrenic angle is likely due to pleural thickening over pleural effusion
 given lack of presence of fluid seen in the lung bases compared to CT
 examination from ___.  The left lung is clear.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and AVR with stable cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours.  A right infusion port is unchanged in position with the tip
 terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable right-sided volume loss and pleural thickening.
 
 Interval improvement in scattered right-sided ground glass and reticular
 opacities which are nonspecific; however, given the appearance on recent CT
 examination, they could be representative of improving asymmetrical drug
 toxicity or atypical infection.
