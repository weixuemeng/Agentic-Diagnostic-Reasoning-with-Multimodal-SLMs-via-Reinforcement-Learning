                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion has substantially increased in size, with a
 large loculated component laterally in the right mid-to-lower hemithorax,
 measuring about 7.2 x 7.5 cm in diameter.  Circumferential pleural opacity
 probably reflects a combination of pleural fluid and pleural thickening based
 on review of prior CT scan.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Persistent
 volume loss in the right hemithorax.  Left lung is slightly overexpanded but
 grossly clear except for an incompletely marginated nodular opacity at the
 left base which probably reflects a nipple shadow and less likely a discrete
 pulmonary nodule.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarging right pleural effusion with 7.5 cm diameter loculated
 component laterally.  Given history of bloody pleural fluid, this probably
 reflects a hemothorax.
