                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with chemo-related pulmonary toxicity and recent
 VATS and postoperative hematoma.  Question change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate stable right
 port with tip in the upper SVC and intact median sternotomy wires.  Prominent
 cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  The right lung volume remains low with similar
 configuration of entrapped/loculated fluid in the right lung.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.  The left lung is
 clear.  Increased soft tissue density in the right chest wall is unchanged,
 consistent with known hematoma.  Cholelithiasis is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change of loculated right pleural
 effusion.
