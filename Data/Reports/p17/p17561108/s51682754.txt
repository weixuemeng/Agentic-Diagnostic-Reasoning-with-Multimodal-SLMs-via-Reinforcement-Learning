                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Patient with lymphoma in remission, prior chemotherapy-induced
 pneumonitis, now with fever and malaise for one  week.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  A right chest wall port
 is noted with the catheter in the upper-to-mid portion of the SVC. Again noted
 are chronic right pleural and parenchymal scarring with volume loss. 
 Right-sided rib resection is also again seen.  Compared to the prior
 radiograph, there are subtle new multifocal, reticulonodular opacities in both
 upper lobes.  There is also a subtle new focal opacity in the left lower lobe.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New upper-lobe predominant reticular and nodular pattern, which could
 represent an atypical or opportunistic pneumonia and less likely an
 asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema.
