                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the central catheter remains
 unchanged.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 widening of the mediastinum in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. 
 Prominence of interstitial markings again reflects mild edema superimposed on
 chronic interstitial changes seen on prior CT scan.
 
 No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
