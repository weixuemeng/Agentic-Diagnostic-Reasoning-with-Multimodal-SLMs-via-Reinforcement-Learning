                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of chronic heart failure and pneumonitis, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a zone of apicolateral
 pleural thickening appears denser and thicker than before.  In addition, there
 is increased thickening at the level of the minor fissure and blunting of the
 right costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a pleural effusion. 
 Associated with these changes is an area of atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.
 
 The left lung is grossly unchanged.  Unchanged signs of minimal left apical
 thickening.  Known old left rib fracture.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  The alignment of the sternal wires is
 constant.  Constant position of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
 
 Although no visible parenchymal abnormality is present, the thickening of the
 pleura, associated with a small pleural effusion is concerning and should be
 reevaluated in light of the clinical history.
 
 At the time of dictation and observation, 11:56 a.m., on the ___, the referring physician, ___. ___, was paged for notification.
