                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Tachycardia and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Right
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the proximal SVC, stable.  There is
 slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, raising concern for a trace
 right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Patchy right upper lobe
 opacity adjacent to the port may relate to external artifact, although an
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Patient is status post median sternotomy. 
 Partial right fifth rib resection and old fracture of the posterior left
 seventh rib again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a small
 pleural effusion.  If patient able, PA and lateral views would be helpful for
 further evaluation.
 2.  Subtle patchy, right upper hemithorax opacity adjacent to the port, may
 represent consolidation, infection vs. relate to external artifact.
