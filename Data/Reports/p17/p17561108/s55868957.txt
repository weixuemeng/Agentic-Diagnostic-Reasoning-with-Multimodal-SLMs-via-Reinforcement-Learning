                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Right-sided
 Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the very upper SVC.  Right lung
 volume remains low and there is a similar configuration to the
 entrapped/loculated fluid in the right lung.  The left lung is clear.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is subtle possible
 increased opacity at the left lung base, which may relate to overlying soft
 tissue, although  an early/developing consolidation is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance to the right hemithorax.  Equivocal subtle
 patchy opacity at the left lower lung, which could be due to atelectasis;
 however, developing consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
