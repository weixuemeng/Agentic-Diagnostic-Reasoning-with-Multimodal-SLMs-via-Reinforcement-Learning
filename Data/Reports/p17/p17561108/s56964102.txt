                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  DAH.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum and diffuse bilateral parenchymal
 opacities, worse in the right lung, are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  If
 any, there is a small right effusion.  Opacities in the lungs are likely mild
 edema superimposed on chronic interstitial changes as seen in prior CT.
 
 Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the mid-SVC.
