 AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with aortic valve repair.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since the previous exam, the patient has been extubated.  The nasogastric
 tube, the Swan-Ganz and the mediastinal catheter have also been removed.  The
 pneumopericardium has regressed.  There is probably a small left-sided apical
 pneumothorax that is less than 3 mm.  Small bilateral pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  Stable enlarged mediastinal and cardiac contours.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 The tubes have been removed.  There is a minimal left apical pneumothorax.
