                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with CHF and AFib, presenting with pneumonia status post
 treatment, and with bilateral pleural effusions.  Assess pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single semi-erect portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to ___, there appears to be an increase in the
 right pleural effusion with fluid in the minor and possibly major fissure;
 however, this may be related to change in positioning. No definitive sign of
 loculated effusion. No pneumothorax.  Bilateral  pulmonary edema with enlarged
 heart appears unchanged.  Mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  Prosthetic
 heart valve again seen in correct position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Possible increase in size of right pleural effusion, however may be
 positional. No definitive evidence of loculation, however this is difficult to
 exclude on plain frontal radiograph. A lateral view would be helpful if the
 condition of the patient permits. A right lateral decubitus radiograph could
 demonstrate the extent of free pleural fluid. Nevertheless, to definitely
 determine whether there is a loculated fluid collection, CT would be
 necessary, especially since the appearance could be compared with the study of
 1 week previously.
 
 2. Pulmonary edema appears unchanged. 
 
 Results were conveyed via telephone to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 ___ on ___ at 11:30 a.m. within 10 minutes of results.
