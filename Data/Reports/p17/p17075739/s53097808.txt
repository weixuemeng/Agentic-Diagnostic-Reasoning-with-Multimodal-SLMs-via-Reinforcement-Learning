                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New endotracheal tube, OG tube, confirm placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest provided.  The NG tube
 descends along the thoracic midline, though the tip is not imaged.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip 2.7 cm above the carina.  A layering
 right pleural effusion likely accounts for increased veil-like opacity in the
 right lung.  Lower lobe opacities may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or
 possibly pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tip of OG tube not included in field of view.  Endotracheal tube
 positioned appropriately.  Otherwise, no change allowing for differences in
 technique.
