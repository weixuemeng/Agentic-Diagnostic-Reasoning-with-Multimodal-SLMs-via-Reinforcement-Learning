                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history ___ ___ bowel obstruction,
 status post SBR, AVR, on Coumadin, CHF, DM, paranoid schizophrenia,
 transferred from nursing home with confusion/agitation and abdominal
 distention with unclear read of pneumothorax on chest x-ray earlier on ___. 
 Deep sulcus sign on the left on previous abdominal film.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study obtained 15 hours earlier during the same day. 
 On the present examination, the pulmonary congestive pattern has decreased;
 however, hazy densities over the bases are consistent with sizable bilateral
 pleural effusions layering in the posterior compartments of the pleural space.
 The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating 3 cm
 above the carina.  Marked cardiac enlargement as before and unchanged position
 of previously described metallic prosthesis of porcine type.  On the present
 image, there is no evidence of any area in the apical or upper pleural spaces
 which rules out any pneumothorax as the patient is examined in semi-upright
 position.  The on previous examination suspected apical areas of linear
 densities in the presence of much more marked congestion are again noted and
 can be explained by skin folds as the patient was in close to flat supine
 position.
 
 Previous CT of ___ and abdominal films of ___ are also reviewed. 
 The present chest examination rules out complicating pneumothorax.  Patient's
 massive pleural effusion persists.
