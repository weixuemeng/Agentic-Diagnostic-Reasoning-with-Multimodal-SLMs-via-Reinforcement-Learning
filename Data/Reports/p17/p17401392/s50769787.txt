                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Spontaneous pneumothorax with pigtail.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and midline.  There is a large right
 pneumothorax.  A pigtail is present in the right mid chest.  There is mild
 atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear.  There
 is probably a small right effusion.
