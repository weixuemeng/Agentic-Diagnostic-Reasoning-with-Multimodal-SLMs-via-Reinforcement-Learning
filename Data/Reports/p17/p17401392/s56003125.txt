 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after right thoracotomy and bilobectomy and
 decortication.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___.
 
 Previous edema in the post-pleurectomy right lung continues to improve.  Small
 right basal pleural effusion, probably unchanged.  Nodulation at the lateral
 aspect of the right lung is present at the site of previous pigtail pleural
 drainage.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.  There may be a very
 small residual of pleural air at the right lung apex, smaller today than on
 the earlier post-operative studies.  Left PIC line ends low in the SVC.
