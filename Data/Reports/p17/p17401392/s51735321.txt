                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post lung decortication.  Assess/followup
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Two new right chest tubes have been placed.  There is a residual small right
 pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are midline.  There is mild vascular congestion. 
 Opacities in the right mid chest could represent small hematomas.  There is
 probably a small right effusion.
