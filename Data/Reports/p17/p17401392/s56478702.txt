                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax, empyema, and chest tube to suction.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right pleural catheter whose pigtail appears stretched or partly
 uncoiled appears unchanged, although it is very likely still within the right
 pleural space.  The left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded.  However,
 aside from streaky minor atelectasis at the left lung base, the visualized
 left lung appears clear.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on the
 right.  There is no evidence for persistent pneumothorax on this examination. 
 A vague opacity along the right lateral chest wall appears similar allowing
 for differences in technique and probably reflects atelectasis or perhaps
 trace loculated fluid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No significant change in position
 of right pleural catheter.
