                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP placement  //
 IABP placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier today
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  There has been interval placement of an
 intra-aortic balloon pump for which the exact location is difficult to
 ascertain as the aortic arch is not clearly visualized.  It however likely
 projects 5.7 cm from the presumed top of the arch.
 
 Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  The size the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited examination determine the exact location of the intra-aortic balloon
 pump.  The top of the aortic arch is difficult to ascertain on this radiograph
 but the IABP is roughly 5.7 cm from the presumed top of the arch.  A repeat
 radiograph could be helpful.
