 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypoxia.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  There is a dense left basilar opacity
 silhouetting the hemidiaphragm.  Elsewhere the lungs are essentially clear. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette has not definitely changed but is obscured at
 its left margin due to the left basilar opacity.  Diffuse sclerotic metastases
 seen throughout the visualized osseous structures most notably at the right
 proximal humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left basilar opacity suggestive of an effusion with underlying
 atelectasis.  Infection also possible.  
 
 2.  Diffuse sclerotic metastases.
