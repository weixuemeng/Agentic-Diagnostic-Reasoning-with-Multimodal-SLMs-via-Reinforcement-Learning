                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up thoracentesis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___, at 8:16 a.m.
 
 Again seen are the three left-sided chest tubes. The uppermost chest tube is
 slightly different in configuration, though this may also be due to
 differences in patient positioning.  
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly lower.  Compared with earlier today, there is
 possible minimal increased lucency in the left upper zone, ? new faint focal
 patchy opacity in the right upper zone, and minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again
 seen is extensive opacification of the left lung with sparing of the uppermost
 left lung.  Extensive sclerotic metastases are again noted -- these make it
 difficult to conclusively evalutae the possible right upper zone opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:   Overall, the appearance is predominantly similar to the prior
 film. Subtle interval changes may be present, detailed above.  No pneumothorax
 is identified.
