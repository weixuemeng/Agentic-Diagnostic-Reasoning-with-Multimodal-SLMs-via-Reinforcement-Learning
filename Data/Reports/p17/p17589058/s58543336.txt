                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest on the same day, CT torso of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung
 volumes.  Right costophrenic angle is blunted, suggestive of small pleural
 effusion.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Hilar and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart is moderately enlarged. 
 Pacemaker leads project over right atrium and right ventricle.  A large
 destructive lesion involving the left shoulder is noted, which is slightly
 progressed since prior.  Left scapula is not visualized. A soft tissue density
 projecting the anterior right fifth rib is new since prior and concerning for
 a new lytic metastatic lesion. Associated soft tissue mass is better seen on
 CTA chest of the same date.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Prominent air-filled loop of large bowel is seen in the
 left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Vascular congestion.
 2.  A large destructive soft tissue lesion involving the left shoulder joint
 has increased since prior.  Right rib lesion is better assessed on CTA chest
 of the same date, is new since prior and is concerning for an additional
 metastatic focus.
