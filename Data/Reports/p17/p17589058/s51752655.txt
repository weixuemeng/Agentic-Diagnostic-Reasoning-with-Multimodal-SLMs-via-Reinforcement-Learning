                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired.  There is
 redemonstration of a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and
 right ventricular leads, not significantly changed.  There is new
 consolidation at the left lung base, representing some combination of
 atelectasis and/or infection as well as a small left pleural effusion. 
 Streaky right lower lung opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis.  There
 may be a small layering pleural effusion on the right.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  The heart is mildly enlarged, slightly increased compared to the prior
 study.  There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings consistent with left lower lung atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
 
 2.  New small left pleural effusion and possible small right layering pleural
 effusion.
 
 3.  Increased mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
