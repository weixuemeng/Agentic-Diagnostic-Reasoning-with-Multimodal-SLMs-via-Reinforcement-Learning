 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:37 PM
  1. Again noted is right lung lesion measuring 2.3 x 2.5 cm better delineated
  on Chest CT of ___.
  2. Small right pleural effusion is noted.
  3. Opacification at the left lung base with silhouetting of the cardiac border
  and diaphragm is concerning for lung collapse with superimposed infection.
  small associated pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
  4.  Large destructive left shoulder lesion erodes the left scapula and the
  acromion and coracoid processes.
  5. Leftward deviated trachea similar in appearance to the prior exam.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hyponatremia in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the
 scapula.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to multiple
 prior studies.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged in appearance.  Right lung
 lesion projecting over the right hilus level is better appreciated on the CT
 torso from ___.  Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely
 present, small to moderate.  Left lower lobe opacity is demonstrated, most
 likely representing area of atelectasis due to a combination of low lung
 volumes and enlarged heart, but infectious process or pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded.  Large destructive left shoulder lesion involving the scapula,
 acromion and coracoid process, better appreciated on the cross-sectional
 studies.  Leftward deviation of the trachea might be related to slightly
 asymmetric position of the neck during the study and appears to be more
 pronounced than on the prior study.  Alternatively, cervical/thoracic inlet
 mass would be another possibility.
