 ONE PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Comparison with the previous study done ___.  There is increased
 density at the left lung base with obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm
 consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation as before.  There is
 continued evidence for small pleural effusions bilaterally as well. 
 Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains
 in place.  Allowing for differences in technique, there is no definite
 interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change.
