                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown
 primary.  Has had left lower lobe collapse on prior imaging with productive
 cough.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The heart is top normal
 size.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  Ill-defined opacity overlying the
 medial right lung corresponds to the mass seen on prior CT torso.  There is
 increased aeration of the left lung, which may be due to improved inspiratory
 effort.  No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.  Deviation of the
 trachea may be positional and is similar to prior.  Wires of a left chest wall
 pacer terminate in stable position.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of left lung, which may be due better
 inspiratory effort.  Ill-defined opacity overlying the medial right lung
 corresponds to the mass seen on prior CT torso.
