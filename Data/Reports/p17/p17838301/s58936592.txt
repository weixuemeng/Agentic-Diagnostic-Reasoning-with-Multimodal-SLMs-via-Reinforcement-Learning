 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Lethargy.  Question pneumonia.  Patient also presents with shortness
 of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.  A band-like
 opacity projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or
 scarring.  More generally, there is mild increased opacification with
 indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 without definite focal opacities.  Calcified pleural plaques are suspected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
