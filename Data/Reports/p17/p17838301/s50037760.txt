                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status and history of
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung apices. 
 Stable linear opacification in the left mid lung likely represents atelectasis
 or scarring.  Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are again seen.  No new
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is
 detected. Cardiomegaly persists.  The aorta is tortuous with calcification.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without radiographic evidence for acute
 change.
