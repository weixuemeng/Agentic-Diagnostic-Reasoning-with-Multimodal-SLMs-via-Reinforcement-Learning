                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient's overlying chin obscures the medial bilateral upper lobes.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Prominence of the pulmonary arteries is
 partially imaged and again seen.  Evidence of diaphragmatic/pleural plaques is
 seen bilaterally suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 The patient's chin overlies the bilateral medial upper lobes, obscuring the
 view.  Given this, the cardiac silhouette is persistently enlarged.  There is
 again prominence of the pulmonary arteries.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
 appears improved.
