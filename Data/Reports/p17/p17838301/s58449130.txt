                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 5:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with AMS, concern for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 18:26.
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 5:32 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly,
 although a pericardial effusion should also be considered.  There is
 prominence of the perihilar vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema on the
 current study.  Calcified diaphragmatic plaques are seen suggestive of prior
 asbestos exposure.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
