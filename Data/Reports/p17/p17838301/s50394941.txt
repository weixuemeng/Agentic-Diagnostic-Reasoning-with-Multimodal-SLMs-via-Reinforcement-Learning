 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, is unchanged since the prior study.  Patchy
 consolidation of the right upper lobe along the mediastinal border is seen. 
 Pleural effusions, if any, are small.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are
 present.  Moderate pulmonary edema is noted. The gastric tube courses through
 the stomach, and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina, and could be withdrawn a few cm for
 optimal positioning.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema. Right upper lobe paramediastinal consolidation,
 which may represent acute infection or asymmetric edema.
