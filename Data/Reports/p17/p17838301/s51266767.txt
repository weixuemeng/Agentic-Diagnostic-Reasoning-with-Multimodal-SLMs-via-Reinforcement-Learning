                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lung volumes are low. 
 Calcified pleural plaques are present.  There is no definite pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Band-like opacity in the left mid lung suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring.  Pulmonary vessels are somewhat engorged centrally
 suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension if not frank pulmonary edema.  There
 is a confluent right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Focal right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
 
 2.  Mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous
 hypertension, but not frank pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 
 4.  Calcified pleural plaques.
