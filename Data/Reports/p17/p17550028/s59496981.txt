                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man p/w seizure and GIB, found to have blood/mucus
 clot collapses Left lung, s/p bronch, now with hgb drop and hypotension  //
 Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric tube courses into the stomach.  Right PICC line terminates in the
 upper right atrium.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter is likely
 at the confluence of the internal jugular and right subclavian veins.
 
 There are multifocal predominantly perihilar opacities, left greater than
 right.  There is significant volume loss of the left lower lobe with elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm overall similar to the study of ___ at
 21:12.  A background of interstitial thickening may reflect mild pulmonary
 edema and is unchanged.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multifocal opacities, left greater than right, could reflect multifocal
 pneumonia, however given the clinical history pulmonary hemorrhage should also
 be considered.  These changes are better assessed on same-day CT of the torso.
 2. Background of mild pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly.
 3. Persistent collapse of the left lower lobe.
