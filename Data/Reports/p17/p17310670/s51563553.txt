                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement with
 mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema and layering bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Heart size is difficult to assess due to these findings; however,
 heart size is likely normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pacer leads
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild-to-moderate interstitial
 edema with layering bilateral pleural effusions.  Assessment for concurrent
 pneumonia is difficult and repeat imaging after diuresis would likely be
 helpful.
