                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY WITH DECUBITUS VIEW, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  chest x-rays of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright and left lateral decubitus views of the chest demonstrate
 moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions which appear to layer.  The right
 effusion is slightly larger than the left.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  Persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement accompanied
 by moderate perihilar edema.  Additionally, a more confluent lobulated opacity
 is contiguous with the right hilum and difficult to evaluate in the setting of
 adjacent pleural effusion and pulmonary edema, but raises the concern for
 possible juxtahilar mass.  Attention to this region on short-term followup
 radiographs after treatment of pulmonary edema would be helpful to assess for
 resolution.  If persistent, contrast-enhanced CT would be suggested to exclude
 a neoplastic process.
