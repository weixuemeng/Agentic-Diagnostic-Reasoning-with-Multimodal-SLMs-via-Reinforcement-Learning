                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M s/p mvc, hit chest on steering wheel  // CXR: Please
 evaluate for rib fracturesCT: Please evaluate for intracranial bleeding
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 2 lead left-sided pacer device is seen, unchanged in position. There is a
 small to moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Left
 basilar opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation is not excluded. Left basilar opacity is grossly
 stable to possibly minimally increased as compared the prior study. Prominence
 and indistinctness of the hila suggest vascular engorgement. Right base
 airspace opacity is increased as compared to the prior study, which may relate
 to fluid overload, however, underlying infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, or
 aspiration is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable. Mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body is grossly
 stable compared to the prior study. No obvious rib fracture there is seen,
 however, dedicated rib series or CT is more sensitive.

 Central vascular engorgement.
