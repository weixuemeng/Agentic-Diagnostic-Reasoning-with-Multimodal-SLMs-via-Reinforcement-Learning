 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral
 chest wall and neck soft tissues.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.  There are
 small bilateral effusions with associated patchy airspace disease at both
 bases, left greater than right, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis,
 although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Left
 shoulder replacement is again partially visualized.
