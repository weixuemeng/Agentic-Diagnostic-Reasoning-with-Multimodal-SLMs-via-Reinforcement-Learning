 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle with some associated airspace
 opacity which may reflect a combination of pleural fluid and patchy lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Improved aeration at the right lung base.  No pulmonary edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is
 calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
