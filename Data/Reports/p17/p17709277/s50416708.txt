                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Stab wound.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT of the torso from ___, obtained immediately after
 the radiograph was performed.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The small right pneumothorax and right pleural effusion which were
 characterized on the CT of the torso are not well visualized on this limited
 supine view.  There is moderate emphysema.  There is no consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Subcutaneous
 gas is noted in the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pneumothorax and right pleural effusion are not
 definitely identified on this exam, and better characterized on the subsequent
 CT of the torso.
