                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD with sputum output, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged.  No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
