                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with worsening shortness of breath. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is
 within normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormalities identified. 
 Thoracic aorta moderately widened and elongated as before with extensive
 calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic pulmonary
 parenchymal abnormalities are seen, and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no cardiac enlargement or pulmonary
 congestion.  No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates.  Stable appearance of
 somewhat low- positioned and flattened diaphragms, which could suggest the
 possibility of COPD, but again acute processes cannot be identified.
