 INDICATION:  Cough and productive sputum after chemotherapy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___, CT
 torso.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Aortic knob is calcified.  There appears to
 be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Additionally, ill-defined airspace
 opacities are noted in both lung bases, concerning for infection or
 aspiration.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is compatible
 with small pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel
 degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for infection or aspiration, as seen
 on the prior CT torso.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are new, with likely
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
