                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with lymphoblastic lymphoma.  Please evaluate for

 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph and ___ CT of the
 torso.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The mild pulmonary edema on the last radiograph has mostly resolved
 as has a left lower lobe pneumonia.  Residual band of opacities in the left
 lower lobe likely correlates to a band of atelectasis, also demonstrated on
 the recent CT of the torso.  Left pleural effusion has decreased in size.
 Right lung is essentially clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
 contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Resolving left lower lobe pneumonia
 2) Previously mild pulmonary edema has improved.
