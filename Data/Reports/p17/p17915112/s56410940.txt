                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, cough, and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There
 is re-demonstration of a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and
 right ventricular leads, not significantly changed in position.  New patchy
 left mid to lower lung opacities likely project over both the left upper and
 lower lobes on the lateral radiograph.  The right lung is clear.  A rounded
 retrocardiac opacity is redemonstrated, most consistent with a small hiatal
 hernia.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal. 
 There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.  Anterior wedging of
 a lower thoracic vertebral body is new compared to the prior study from ___.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings concerning for left mid to lower lung pneumonia, likely involving
 both portions of the upper and lower lobes.  Recommend follow-up to
 resolution.
 
 2.  Compression deformity involving a lower thoracic vertebral body, new
 compared to the prior study from ___, but otherwise age indeterminate.
 
 3.  Unchanged small hiatal hernia.
