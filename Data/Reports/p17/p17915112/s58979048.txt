                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent PNA and CP.  // Eval for acute
 cardio/pulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Dual lead left pacemaker device appears intact and unchanged in position.
 
 Opacity projecting over the right mid hemi thorax is new.  Another opacity
 projects over the region of the left lower mid hemi thorax.  Retrocardiac
 opacity obscures part of the left heart border.  These findings could be seen
 with an infectious process such as multifocal pneumonia.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Anterior wedging of a lower thoracic
 vertebral body is unchanged.  Large to moderate hiatal hernia is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Multifocal pneumonia.  Follow-up radiograph after treatment to ensure
 resolution.  If there is no complete resolution, a dedicated chest CT is
 recommended to exclude underlying lesion.
 
 2.  Large hiatal hernia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up radiograph after treatment to ensure resolution.
 If there is no complete resolution, a dedicated chest CT is recommended to
 exclude underlying lesion.
