 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of right chest tube, a small-to-moderate right
 apical pneumothorax has developed.  This has subsequently been followed on
 separately dictated chest radiograph performed after this time.  Endotracheal
 tube has been removed.  Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly withdrawn, now
 terminating in right ventricular outflow tract.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable except for resolution of pneumomediastinum.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema has slightly worsened, and note is also made of increased
 right pleural effusion with adjacent worsening atelectasis in the right mid
 and lower lung regions.  Left basilar atelectasis has also slightly worsened
 and is accompanied by a small left pleural effusion.
