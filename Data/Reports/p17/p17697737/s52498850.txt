                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with lung mass.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 13:54 at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Large
 rounded opacity is seen projecting over the posterior right lower hemithorax. 
 Difficult to definitively discern whether this mass-like opacity is
 pleural-based or parenchymal.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. 
 There is mild prominence of the right hilum, not well evaluated, but
 underlying lymphadenopathy is likely present.
