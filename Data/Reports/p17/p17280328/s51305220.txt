                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected swallowed foreign body.
 
 The dedicated upper chest radiograph including the upper medial portion of the
 chest demonstrates a radiopaque arrow-like object approximately 6 mm in
 diameter projecting at the level of upper esophagus and might represent the
 presumably swallowed object.  The NG tube is in place.
