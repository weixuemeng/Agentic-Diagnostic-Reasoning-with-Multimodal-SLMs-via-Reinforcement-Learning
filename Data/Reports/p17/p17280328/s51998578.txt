 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric antrum.  The heart is normal in
 size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There
 is mild volume loss at the left lung base with elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and streaky lingular opacity associated with volume loss. 
 Elsewhere, however, the lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with left basilar atelectasis; otherwise unremarkable
 study.
