                                 FINAL REPORT
 Evaluation of the patient after NG tube placement.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube has been removed and replaced by the NG tube that terminates
 at the stomach.  The current study includes the image of mid and lower portion
 of the chest.  Within the imaged portion, there is no evidence of previously
 seen radiopaque foreign body as well as it is not seen in the upper abdomen. 
 It potentially can remain in the not included in the field of view superior
 portion of the esophagus.
