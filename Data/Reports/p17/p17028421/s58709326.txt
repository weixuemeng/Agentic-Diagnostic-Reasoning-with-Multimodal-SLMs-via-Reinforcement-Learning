                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left lower
 lobe opacity is worrisome for consolidation due to pneumonia.  There is minor
 right basilar atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion is seen, although a
 trace left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given differences in
 technique and low lung volumes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings worrisome for left lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
