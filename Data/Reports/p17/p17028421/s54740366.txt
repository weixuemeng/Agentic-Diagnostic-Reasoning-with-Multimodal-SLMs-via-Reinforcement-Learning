                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with sarcoidosis,
 tracheobronchomalacia with four days of productive cough, low-grade fever,
 anorexia and malaise.  Abnormal lung sounds on the left.  Evaluate for
 infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  On previous examination identified residual
 densities on the right base have now cleared up completely and the right
 hemithorax does not show any pulmonary abnormalities with the exception of a
 mild thickening of the minor fissure.  On the left side on the other hand the
 lower lobe area demonstrates now a diffuse haze with crowded vascular
 structures and perivascular densities consistent with an inflammatory process.
 Comparison with the previous study shows clearly that this process has
 developed during the last two months.  No other significant new abnormalities
 are seen.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion and no pneumothorax in
 the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New left lower lobe parenchymal densities matching the clinical
 findings of abnormal findings on the left base and consistent with new
 pneumonic process.  It is recommended to perform followup chest examinations.
