                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with acute diverticulitis and mild hypoxia.  //
 Please eval for e/o pneumonia vs. atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits,
 and lungs and pleural surfaces are clear except for a questionable 1.3 cm
 nodular opacity at the left apex and a small linear focus of scar or
 atelectasis at the right lung base.  Scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Questionable left apical nodule, very likely due to superimposition of normal
 structures on this rotated radiograph.  Initial further evaluation with PA,
 lateral and apical lordotic views of the chest would be helpful to exclude the
 possibility of a true pulmonary nodule this region.
