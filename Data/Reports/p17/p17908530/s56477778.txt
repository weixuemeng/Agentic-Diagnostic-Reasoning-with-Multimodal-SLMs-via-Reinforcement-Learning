                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fatigue and leukocytosis  // eval for pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___ chest x-rays and chest CT
 from ___. .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted. There are persistent increased interstitial
 opacities throughout the lungs. Findings are slightly more prominent when
 compared to the exam with similar inspiratory effort from ___.
 Increased opacity in the costophrenic angles posteriorly is compatible with
 atelectasis and possible small effusions. Compression deformities in the lower
 thoracic and upper lumbar spine are as seen on prior scout film from recent CT
 scan.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs. This may be in part due
 to chronic underlying process, however superimposed component of edema is
 suspected.
 Atelectasis and probable small effusions, infection not entirely excluded.
