                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia, amiodarone toxicity, continued O2
 requirement, prev had pulm edema // interval change, AM ROUNDS ___ IS
 FINE, THANKS!
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to the prior CXR of ___, there has been slight interval
 improvement in appearance of interstitial opacities, which likely reflects
 both better ventilation and improving interstitial edema. There is bibasilar
 atelectasis. Left pleural effusion seen on the prior radiograph appears to
 have resolved.  Left lung base opacity described on the prior study is not
 well demonstrated on today's study due to overlying pacemaker. The ventricular
 lead of the pacemaker is stable in position. However, the right atrial lead is
 currently in the right atrial appendage, previously in the right atrium proper
 ___ ___. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Less prominent interstitial markings, which reflects improved ventilation
 and resolving interstitial edema.
 2. Right atrial lead of pacemaker has slightly changed its position since
 ___, currently within the atrial appendage.
