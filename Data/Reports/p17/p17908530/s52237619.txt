                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with increased o2 requirement  // eval for pulm
 edema
 
 COMPARISON:  None avail
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is accompanied by a tortuous thoracic aorta and pulmonary
 vascular congestion. Permanent pacemaker is present with leads overlying
 expected locations of right atrium and right ventricle. Combined alveolar and
 interstitial opacities may reflect acute pulmonary edema, but followup
 radiographs after diuresis are strongly suggested to exclude a more chronic
 interstitial process. At that time, a more confluent area opacity in the left
 retrocardiac region may also be better evaluated.
