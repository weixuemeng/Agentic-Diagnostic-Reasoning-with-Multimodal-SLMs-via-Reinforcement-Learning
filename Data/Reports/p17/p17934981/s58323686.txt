                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with temperature of 102 degrees, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar, and no pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the
 diaphragms. Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral
 view appears chronic, and could reflect pleural thickening.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation
 is identified. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung hyperinflation suggestive of COPD with bibasilar atelectasis or scarring.
