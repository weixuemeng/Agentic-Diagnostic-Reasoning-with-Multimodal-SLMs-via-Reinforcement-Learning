                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study.  Heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous, and the mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear similar.  There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no frank pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Extensive degenerative changes are
 noted involving left glenohumeral joint.  Patient is status post right
 shoulder prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreased lung volumes with patchy opacities within the lung bases, possibly
 atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 
 Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
