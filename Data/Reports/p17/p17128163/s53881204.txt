                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma.  Left chest and abdominal pain after being struck by car
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart size is top normal.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes and supine AP
 technique.  There is upper zone vascular redistribution which may be
 attributable to supine positioning without overt pulmonary edema.  Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.  Mildly displaced
 fractures of the left lateral sixth and seventh ribs are noted.  Degenerative
 spurring is seen involving the right acromioclavicular joint.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  Mildly displaced left sixth and
 seventh rib fractures.
