 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___, most recently 17:22.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube has been repositioned, in standard placement.  Slight increase in the
 extent of opacification in the right lung is probably due to a decrease in
 moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right still greater than left, rather
 than much change in severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation due to pneumonia
 and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 Other lines and tubes in stable, standard positions.  No pneumothorax.
