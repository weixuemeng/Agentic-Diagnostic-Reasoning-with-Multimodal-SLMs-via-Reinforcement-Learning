 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress and intubated now s/p
 OGT placement.  // confirm OGT placement     confirm OGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___, most recently 14:52, and
 chest CT ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 With the chin down, tip of the new endotracheal tube less than a cm from the
 carina is 2.5 cm below appropriate positioning.  Esophageal drainage tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  New left internal jugular line ends
 in the low SVC.  Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads
 continuous from the left pectoral generator.
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved or cleared, but there is still very
 severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation, worst throughout the right lung but
 in the left lower lobe as well.  This is pneumonia and/or pulmonary
 hemorrhage.
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, has increased
 since ___, probablya reflection of previous transient heart failure.
