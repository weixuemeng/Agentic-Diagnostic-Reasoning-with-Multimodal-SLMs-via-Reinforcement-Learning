 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia and hemoptysis transferred here.
 // confirm ETT placement and left IJ placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  Left IJ
 central line is present --___ tip partially obscured, but likely overlying the
 mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is extensive somewhat patchy opacification of the right lung, with air
 bronchograms.  There is a vascular plethora in the left lung.There is
 increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Probable small right-greater-than-left effusions.   
 Biapical pleural scarring is present.
 
 A left-sided dual lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right

 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  Left IJ central line tip

 2. Extensive opacification of the right lung, with air bronchograms.  The
 differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, as CHF is also seen the left
