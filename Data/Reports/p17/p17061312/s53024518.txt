                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting after recent liver surgery.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Preoperative radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low, limiting assessment of the lung bases,
 although streaky left basilar atelectasis is suspected.  Elsewhere, the lungs
 appear clear.  There are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The
 stomach is mild-to-moderately distended with an air-fluid level. 
 Characterization of dilated bowel is better depicted on abdominal radiographs
 that cover the whole abdomen and pelvis from the same day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
