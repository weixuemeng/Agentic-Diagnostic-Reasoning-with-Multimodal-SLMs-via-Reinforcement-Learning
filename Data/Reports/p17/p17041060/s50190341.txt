                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post Whipple, removal of PICC line, question if IJ tip still
 in place.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the
 diaphragm, overlying the stomach.  Additional tubing is seen across the upper
 abdomen, extending beyond the right edge of the film.  A right IJ line is
 present, tip over proximal SVC.  Additional linear density extending from the
 right lung apex inferiorly over the mediastinum is noted, ? epidural catheter.
 
 
 The previously seen right subclavian PICC line is no longer visualized. 
 Within the limits of plain film radiography, no retained radiopacity to
 suggest a retained portion of the PICC line is identified.  
 
 There is patchy opacity at both lung bases, likely atelectasis in light of low
 inspiratory volumes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential
 diagnosis could include infectious infiltrates.
 
 No pneumothorax detected. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) Lines and tubes as described.  No radiopaque foreign body to suggest
 retained catheter fragment is detected.  Please see comment above.  
 
 2) Patchy opacity at both lung bases.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 the differential diagnosis could include infectious infiltrates, but there are
 also low lung volumes, that would account for atelectasis.
