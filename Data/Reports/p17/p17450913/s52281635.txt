                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain with prior history of pulmonary embolism.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present, which limits assessment of the lung bases.  As
 noted previously, bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are noted left more so
 than on the right.  These findings may reflect atelectasis but infection,
 aspiration, or even infarction cannot be completely excluded.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable,
 and the cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities, left more so than right.  Findings are
 nonspecific but could reflect infection, atelectasis, aspiration, or possibly
 infarction.
