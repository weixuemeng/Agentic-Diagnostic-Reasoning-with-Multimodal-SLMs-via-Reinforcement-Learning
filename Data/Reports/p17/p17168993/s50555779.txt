                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Lethargy, low O2 sat, question infectious process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 Rotated positioning.  Compared with ___, allowing for technical
 differences, there has been improvement in the vascular and CHF findings. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is aneurysmal dilatation
 of the aortic arch, measuring up to 6.1 cm on the lateral view.  There is
 increased density in the left lower lobe which may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and changes in opacity related to the vascular findings.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Please see detailed report of chest CTA from ___ describing extensive
 vascular abnormalities, right lung apex spiculated nodule and upper
 mediastinal lymph node.  
 2. No CHF or effusion is identified.  Doubt infectious consolidation.  Please
 see comment above.
