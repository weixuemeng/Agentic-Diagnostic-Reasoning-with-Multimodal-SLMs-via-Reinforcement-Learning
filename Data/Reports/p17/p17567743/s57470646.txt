  1.  Streaky opacities at lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis although
  developing infection in the left lung base cannot be completely excluded. 
  
  2.  No displaced rib fractures noted, although if there is continued clinical
  concern for a displaced rib fracture then a dedicated rib series is
  recommended.  
  
  3.  ___ millimeter nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lung field
  and left anterior 1st rib.  Shallow oblique views can be obtained for further
  assessment to determine if these are nodules within the lungs.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea after fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Streaky opacities in the lung bases may
 reflect atelectasis although developing infection particularly in the left
 lung base cannot be completely excluded.  Vague ___ millimeter nodular opacity 
 projects over the left anterior 1st rib.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is present.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.  No definite displaced rib
 fractures noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
