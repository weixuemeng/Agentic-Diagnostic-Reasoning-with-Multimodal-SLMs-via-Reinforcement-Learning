                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Short of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  Midline sternotomy wires
 are noted.  A PICC line again noted entering the left arm with tip residing in
 the region of the superior vena cava.  The previously noted left apical
 pneumothorax is not clearly visualized and may have resolved in the interval. 
 There is marked cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is noted which could in part reflect an underpenetrated technique,
 though the possibility of effusion and consolidation is difficult to exclude. 
 Bony structures appear grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly with retrocardiac opacity which could in part
 reflect an underpenetrated technique, though consolidation and effusion cannot
 be excluded on the basis of this exam.  Interval resolution of left apical
 pneumothorax.  Mild interstitial edema noted.  Consider dedicated PA and
 lateral views to further assess.
