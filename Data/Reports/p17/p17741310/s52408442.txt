                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG and aortic valve
 replacement.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  The replaced aortic valve is in the
 expected position.  CABG sutures and coronary artery stents are noted.  The
 interstitial changes consistent most likely with chronic interstitial lung
 disease are redemonstrated, unchanged with no evidence of newly developed
 process.  Lateral view demonstrates compression fractures at the different
 level of the thorax, chronicity unclear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
 
 There is small left apical pneumothorax, unchanged since the prior study.
