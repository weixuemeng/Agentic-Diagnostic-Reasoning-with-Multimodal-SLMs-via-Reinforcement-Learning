                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of lymphoma on chemo and is now
 neutropenic with cough. Please r/o PNA.  // ___ year old woman with hx of
 lymphoma on chemo and is now neutropenic with cough. Please r/o PNA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to most recent chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged, slightly decreased in size compared to the prior
 chest radiograph, allowing for differences in technique.  The lungs are
 well-expanded.  Mild streaky opacities in the left lower lobe likely reflect
 atelectasis. The right lung is clear. A dual lumen, accessed right chest wall
 Port-A-Cath is in place, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild cardiomegaly. Mild streaky left lower lobe opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis but short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude an
 early focus of pneumonia. If clinical suspicion for infection persists.
