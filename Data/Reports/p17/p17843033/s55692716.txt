                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 3:58
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with shortness of breath and CHF, question
 volume status, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 15:52.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest, ___ at 3:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Heart remains enlarged.  Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  There is calcification and unfolding
 of the aorta, consistent with atherosclerosis.  Layering bilateral effusions
 with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely consistent with compressive
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Persistent prominence of
 the right perihilar vasculature suggests an element of congestion.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
