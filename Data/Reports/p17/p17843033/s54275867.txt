                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypotension, line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 9:23.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier this morning,
 there has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with
 its tip terminating at the mid to lower SVC.  There is no definite
 pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube terminates 8 cm above the carina.  Enteric
 tube is in unchanged position.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and
 small left pleural effusion persist. Left lower lobe opacity could reflect
 atelectasis, however, a superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid-to lower SVC. No
 definite pneumothorax.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube terminates 8 cm above the carina, well above the
 clavicles. Repositioning is recommended.
