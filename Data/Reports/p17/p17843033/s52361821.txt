                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with hypoxia.  Study requested for evaluation of
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is substantial worsening of a large right pleural effusion. 
 Persistent right basal opacity could be related to atelectasis or early
 developing pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion, if any. No
 pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  The azygos vein is dilated and
 there is pulmonary vascular congestion.  Note is made of a cardiac
 calcification overlying the heart on the right. If additional information is
 needed regarding cardiac chambers or cardiac calcifications, conventional
 radiography would be recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Substantial worsening of large right pleural effusion and persistent right
 basal consolidation which could represent atelectasis or early developing
 pneumonia.  Close clinical followup is recommended.
 
 2. Increased intravascular volume.
