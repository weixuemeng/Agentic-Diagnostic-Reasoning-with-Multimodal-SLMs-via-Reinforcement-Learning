                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ET tube and OGT placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm above the carina.  An
 enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and its tip terminates in the gastric
 fundus.  Moderate-to- severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is not visualized, likely related to the presence of a moderate
 to large pleural effusion.  Small left-sided pleural effusion is present. Left
 lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis, however, a superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded. There is no definite pneumothorax.  There is no
 overt pulmonary edema. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube terminates 7.6 cm above the carina, repositioning is recommended. 
 Enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus.
 
 2.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left-sided pleural
 effusion. 
 
 3.  Left lower lobe opacity may represent atelectasis, cannot rule out
 superimposed infection.
