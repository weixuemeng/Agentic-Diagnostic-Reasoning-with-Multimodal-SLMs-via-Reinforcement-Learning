                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with bacteremia, CHF exacerbation, subglottic
 tracheal stricture.  Evaluate fluid status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: A pleural pigtail catheter terminates at the right lung base. There
 is significant improvement of the moderate to large right pleural effusion.
 There is asymmetric edema of the left lung.  Air bronchograms and dense
 consolidation of the left lung base is likely reflective of volume loss. There
 is no large pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Significant improvement of moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.
 
 2.  Asymmetric left-sided pulmonary edema with dense consolidation of the left
 lower lobe, likely related to volume loss.
