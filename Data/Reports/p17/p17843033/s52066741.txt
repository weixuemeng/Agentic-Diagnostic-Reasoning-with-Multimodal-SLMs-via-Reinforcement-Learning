                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with hypoxic respiratory failure,
 re-evaluate ETT after adjustment.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study
 obtained five hours earlier during the same day.  The ETT terminates in the
 trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  Apparently, it has been
 adjusted.  Unchanged position of previously described right internal jugular
 approach central venous line.  No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical
 areas.  Marked cardiac enlargement including prominence of left atrial
 contours persist.  Pulmonary congestive pattern as before with perivascular
 haze.  Supine position with layering pleural effusion  posterior compartments
 of pleural space may account for increasing diffuse haze in the lung fields. 
 No evidence of new discrete local parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable ETT position following adjustment.  Persistent
 marked cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion, bilateral pleural effusions in
 this patient in supine position.
