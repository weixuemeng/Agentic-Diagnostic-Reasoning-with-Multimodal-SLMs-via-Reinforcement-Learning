                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory distress  // ett placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea.
 
 There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, particularly involving the
 right upper lobe and right infrahilar region.  No pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax identified.  A mild peripheral interstitial prominence may
 reflect an element of pulmonary interstitial edema.  The size of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Airspace opacities particularly involving the right upper lobe and right
 infrahilar region are suspicious for multifocal pneumonia and aspiration. 
 Mild underlying pulmonary interstitial edema.
