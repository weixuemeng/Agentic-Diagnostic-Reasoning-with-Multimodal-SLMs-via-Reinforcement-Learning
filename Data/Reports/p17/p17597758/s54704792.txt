                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with history of malignancy, unclear as to specific
 subtype.
 
 STUDY:  AP semi-upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is enlarged, slightly increased from prior exam. 
 Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are compatible with prior chest
 surgery.  The lungs are clear of lobar consolidation, and there is no
 radiographic evidence of large pulmonary metastases.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or for large pulmonary
 metastases; chest CT would be more sensitive in detecting small pulmonary
 nodules.
