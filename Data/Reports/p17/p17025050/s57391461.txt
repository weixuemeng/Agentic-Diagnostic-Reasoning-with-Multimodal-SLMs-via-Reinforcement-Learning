                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low.  As compared to the prior examination, there
 is slightly increased conspicuity of the interstitial lung markings which may
 be consistent with interstitial edema.  Linear opacities at the right base are
 unchanged and likely represent atelectasis or scarring.  There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Dense opacity at the left base is new and
 obscures the left hemidiaphragm.  This could be due to atelectasis and
 effusion; however, the presence of a consolidation or pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  The bones are diffusely demineralized.  There are remote bilateral
 rib fractures and compression deformities of thoracic vertebra.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild congesiton, pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
 Please refer to subsequent CTA chest for further details.
