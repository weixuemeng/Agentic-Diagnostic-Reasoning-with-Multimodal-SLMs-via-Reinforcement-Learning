 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with head cbleed w shift and ETT pls assess
 placement and head forp interval bleed  // History: ___F with head cbleed w
 shift and ETT pls assess placement and head forp interval bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 15:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.8 cm above the level of the
 carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for more optimal
 positioning. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm into the left abdomen,
 inferior aspect not included on the image. Left base opacity with shift of the
 mediastinum to the left suggests left lower lobe collapse with possible
 underlying pleural effusion or consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is
 top-normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina, recommend withdrawal by
 approximately 2 cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 Left base opacity with leftward shift of the mediastinum suggest left lower
 lobe collapse, underlying pleural effusion or consolidation not excluded.
