                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with lung cancer, PICC line maintained at home,
 no blood return this a.m., confirm correct PICC line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a malpositioned right PICC line which enters the right internal
 jugular vein and projects off the superior edge of the radiograph. 
 Postsurgical changes are noted in the right hemi thorax from prior
 pneumonectomy, similar appearance to prior radiographs.  New since prior
 radiographs is diffuse interstitial prominence involving the left long,
 possibly related to bronchial wall thickening.  There is no left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Malpositioned right PICC line enters the right IJ and requires
 repositioning.
 2. Postsurgical appearance of the right hemi thorax status post pneumonectomy,
 similar to priors.
 3. New diffuse left lung interstitial abnormality could reflect bronchial wall
 thickening and small airways disease or atypical infection in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
