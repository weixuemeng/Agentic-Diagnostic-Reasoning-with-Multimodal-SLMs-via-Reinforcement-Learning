                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with RUL cavitary lesion
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Again seen, is a cavitary lesion
 within the right upper lobe with surrounding op opacity likely reflective of
 right upper lobe collapse.  Subtle band like opacity in the right lower lung
 is new from prior and may represent an area of developing consolidation.  Left
 lung remains essentially clear.  No large effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax. 
 Heart size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe cavity again noted with wispy opacity in the right lower lung
 concerning for developing focus of pneumonia.
