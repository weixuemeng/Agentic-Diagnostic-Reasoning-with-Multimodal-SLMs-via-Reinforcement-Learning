                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with seizure, needs infectious workup
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post right pneumonectomy with air and fluid noted in the
 right hemi thorax, similar to that seen on the prior examination.  Heart size
 is difficult to assess given the postsurgical changes in the right hemi
 thorax.  Mediastinal contour is similar.  Streaky opacity in the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded and
 appears similar compared to the previous chest radiograph.  No left lung
 consolidation is seen.  There is no left-sided pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  A clip is seen within the right lateral chest wall along with
 adjacent subcutaneous emphysema.  The right PICC appears to been withdrawn,
 now terminating in the region the right axilla.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection
 is not completely excluded.  Status post right pneumonectomy with unchanged
 postoperative appearance of the right hemi thorax.  Right PICC appears
 withdrawn now terminating in the region of the right axilla.
