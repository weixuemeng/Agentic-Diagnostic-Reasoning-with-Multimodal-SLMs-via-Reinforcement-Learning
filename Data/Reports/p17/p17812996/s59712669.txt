                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness and unstable gait.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased
 retrosternal clear space with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings
 towards the apices compatible with emphysema.  Blunting of the costophrenic
 angles posteriorly could suggest scarring versus trace pleural effusions. 
 Lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Emphysema.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly could suggest
 scarring versus small bilateral pleural effusions.  No radiographic evidence
 for pneumonia.
