                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is a left lower lobe consolidation compatible
 with pneumonia.  There is also vague right basilar opacity, difficult to
 localize on the lateral, but potentially within the lower lobe.  Superiorly,
 the lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Osseous and
 soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe pneumonia.  Additional right basilar opacity
 could be due to additional focus of infection versus atelectasis.
