                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with submassive PE, s/p bilateral
 catheter-directed tPA lysis with ECOS  // evaluate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. New patchy right basilar opacity
 probably reflects atelectasis although aspiration and early focus of pneumonia
 may produce a similar radiographic appearance.
