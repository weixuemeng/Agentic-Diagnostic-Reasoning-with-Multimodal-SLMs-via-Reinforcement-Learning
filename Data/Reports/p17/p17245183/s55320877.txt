                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision.  Evaluate for fracture or contusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Lungs are hypoinflated, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature, with mild
 bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation is present.  Pleural surfaces
 are clear without effusion or pneumothorax. Medial lung apices are obscured by
 the patient's chin projecting over this region. No distracted rib fracture is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No distracted rib fracture, though dedicated rib
 series may be helpful if there is focal concern.
