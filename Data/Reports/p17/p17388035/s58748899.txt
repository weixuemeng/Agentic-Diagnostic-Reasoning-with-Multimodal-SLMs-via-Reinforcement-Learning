                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SLE and pleuritic chest pain  // Eval for
 pleural effusion vs. pna      Eval for pleural effusion vs. pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No previous images.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is
 no vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle is seen on the frontal view, though there is no evidence of
 posterior opacification on the lateral projection.  This suggests pleural
 thickening rather than effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
