                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pancreatic cancer
 after chest tube removal.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 After removal of the Port-A-Cath, there is an overall unchanged appearance of
 partially loculated left pleural effusion.  Patient continues to be in
 pulmonary edema.  Nodularity projecting over the lungs corresponds to known
 pulmonary metastasis as well as pleural metastasis.
