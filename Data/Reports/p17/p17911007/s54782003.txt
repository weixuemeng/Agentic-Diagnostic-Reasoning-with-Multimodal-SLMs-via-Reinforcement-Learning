                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer, now with worsening shortness of
 breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the right atrium.  There is
 rightward shift of mediastinal structures due to the presence of a large left
 pleural effusion, which is significantly increased in size compared to the
 previous CT.  Left basilar opacification is likely due to compressive
 atelectasis.  Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the
 large pleural effusion.  Numerous nodular opacities within the right lung base
 are compatible with known metastatic disease.  Hyperinflation of the lungs
 with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is
 compatible with underlying emphysema.  No pneumothorax is present.  Blunting
 of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left pleural effusion, significantly increased in size compared to the
 previous exam.  Innumerable nodules within the right lung base compatible with
 metastatic disease.  Emphysema.  Trace right pleural effusion.
