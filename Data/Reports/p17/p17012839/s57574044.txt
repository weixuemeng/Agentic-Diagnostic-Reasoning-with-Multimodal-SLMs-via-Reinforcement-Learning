                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF and metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the dual-channel pacemaker
 device is again seen with unchanged leads.  Cardiac silhouette remains at the
 upper limits of normal in size.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure and there is blunting of the
 costophrenic angles bilaterally.  The area of opacification at the right base
 laterally is again seen, which could represent a parenchymal nodule extending
 into the region of the minor fissure.
 
 The sclerotic metastases in the lower thoracic region seen on CT are not
 definitely appreciated on this study.
