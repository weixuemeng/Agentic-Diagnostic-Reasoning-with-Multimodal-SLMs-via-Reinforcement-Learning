                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, rule out acute process.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray from ___.  Targeted review of CTA
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Suspect background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  There is moderate
 cardiomegaly, with splaying of the carina.  There is upper zone redistribution
 and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  Some Kerley B lines are
 noted. There is hilar prominence, right > left.  There are small bilateral
 effusions.  The possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude at the bases.  
 
 Prominence of the interstitial markings and presence of effusions are new
 compared with the ___ radiograph and the cardiac silhouette is also more
 pronounced. Right hilum is more prominent cmpared with ___. 
 
 Advanced degenerative changes of the spine, with mild wedging of the
 presumptive T12 vertebral body, is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiomegaly, slightly worse compared with ___.
 
 2.  Interstitial edema, Kerley B lines and small effusions, consistent with
 CHF, which appears new compared with a ___ CTA. Given the limited degree
 of upper zone redistribution, the differential includes other causes of
 increased institial markings, but given the relatively rapid onset and
 presence of small effusions, CHF is most likely.   
 
 3.  Interval increase in right hilar prominence. This may be related to the
 CHF findings.  However, follow-up radiographs to confirm return to ___
 baseline is recommended. 
 
 4.  In the appropriate clinical setting, underlying infectious infiltrate
 would be difficult to exclude.
