                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral view shows a 13mm nodular opacity projecting over the
 heart just above the diaphragm, which may explain the slight increase in size
 of the lingular opacity obscuring the cardiac apex on the frontal view.  This
 would be an unusually small pneumonia, though possible.  If it does not
 resolve in four weeks, it needs to be investigated with a CT scan. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged with right
 atrial enlargement as before with otherwise normal hilar and mediastinal
 contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New nodule, could be lung infection.  Suggest follow up CXR in 4
 weeks.
