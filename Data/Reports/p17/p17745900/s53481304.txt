                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure, presenting status
 post fall, with right perihilar "infiltrate" on outside hospital chest
 radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest are provided.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is noted.  There is minimal peribronchial cuffing with trace
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are likely
 small bilateral pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.  Numerous
 surgical clips are noted throughout the mediastinum and upper abdomen. 
 Scattered pleural calcifications are present, left greater than right.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and trace interstitial pulmonary edema
 along with cardiomegaly, suggests mild decompensated congestive heart failure.
 
 2. Given the extensive chronic findings, CT should be considered if there is
 further clinical concern for pneumonia.
