                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o hx of prostate Ca s/p brachytherapy followed for
 surveillance annually, HLD, HTN c subaceous cyst abscess s/p I+D presenting
 with FUO on vancomycin  // eval for pneumonia vs atelectasis     eval for
 pneumonia vs atelectasis
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing prominence of
 the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent
 with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion.  Areas of more coalescent
 opacification are present at the bases, especially on the right.  Although
 this could merely represent atelectasis and small effusions, in the
 appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the retrocardiac region, especially on the right.
