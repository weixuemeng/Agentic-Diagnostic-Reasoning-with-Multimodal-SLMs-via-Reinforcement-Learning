 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Clearing pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing known
 pneumonia on the right has improved.  However, remnant opacities are still
 seen, notably on the lateral radiograph.  There is no evidence of
 complications such as abscess or pleural effusion.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  No
 mediastinal abnormalities.
