                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, dyspnea and leg swelling.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with severe cardiomegaly. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Lungs are well-expanded.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is slightly worsened compared to the prior study.  A more
 confluent opacity at the right lung base may indicate developing pneumonia in
 the correct clinical setting.  A left pectoral single lead pacemaker is
 present with tip terminating in the right ventricle as expected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New right lower lobe opacity concerning for developing pneumonia in the
 correct clinical setting.
 2. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly worse than the prior study.
