                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 There is little change from prior study.  There is no new parenchymal opacity
 to suggest pneumonia, and there is no vascular congestion or pulmonary edema
 to suggest congestive failure.  A left pectoral pacer is in unchanged
 position, with a single transsubclavian lead extending to the right ventricle.
 There is no pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is
 unchanged, moderately enlarged.  There is stable calcification and unfolding
 of the thoracic aorta.  Moderate thoracic spondylosis is unchanged.  No acute
 compression deformities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of congestive hear
 failure as clinically questioned.
