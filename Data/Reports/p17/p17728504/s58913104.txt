                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right middle lobe pneumonia per ___ chest x-ray.  The patient is clinically improved, but with new onset
 pedal edema.  Assess for interval change.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Uniform opacification of at least the
 medial subsegment of the right middle lobe is unchanged since the ___ study.  The absence of air bronchograms is sometimes a feature of
 bronchial obstruction.  A small right pleural effusion is stable.  The left
 lung remains clear.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Left-sided pacemaker
 with single lead ending in the right ventricle is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Overall, little change since the ___ study. No pulmonary
 edema with stable cardiomegaly. 
 
 2. Stable appearance of right middle lobe opacification. If symptoms and
 radiographic abnormality do not improve within two weeks, further evaluation
 with contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended to exclude bronchial
 obstruction.
