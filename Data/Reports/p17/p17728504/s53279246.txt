                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with paroxysmal AFib, normal chest exam and O2 sats
 with dyspnea, assess for acute process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs are well expanded and clear
 mild right middle lobe bronchiectasis and minimal right middle lobe opacity
 which most likely reflects changes due to recurrent infection or atelectasis
 in the right middle lobe.  While moderate cardiomegaly with mitral annular
 calcification persists with satisfactory positioned single-lead pacemaker
 device, there is no finding of acute congestive failure.
