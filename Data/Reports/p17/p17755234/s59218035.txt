                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARF, query flash edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral confluent opacities, predominantly in the perihilar and
 lower lungs are persisting.  In addition, since yestarday, few ill-defined
 opacities in the right upper lobe, are new.  Though this radiographic
 appearance can be seen in pulmonary edema, which is the clinical question,
 Given the density of these opacities, especially in the right lower lobe, a
 concurrent second pathology, like pulmonary hemorrhage, however, cannot be
 ruled out.  Pleural effusions bilaterally are least minimal.  Right internal
 jugular dual-lumen catheter sheath tip is at mid SVC.  Heart is normal size
 and mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
