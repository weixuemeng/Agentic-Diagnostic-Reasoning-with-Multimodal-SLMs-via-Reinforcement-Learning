                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate bilateral
 perihilar opacities, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  This is coupled
 with pulmonary vascular engorgement in the upper lobes as well as blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle, consistent with small pleural effusion.  However,
 the heart and mediastinum are not enlarged.  Aside from bibasilar atelectasis,
 the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, small left pleural effusion, and pulmonary
 vascular redistribution.  Because the heart and mediastinum are not widened,
 non-cardiac causes of pulmonary edema should be explored.  The patient could
 be empirically treated via diuresis, but if the clinical picture is not in
 agreement, CT of the chest may be obtained for further characterization.
