                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with four right lower rib  fractures
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 12:21
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is
 normal.  Fractures of the right fifth through eighth lateral ribs are
 re-demonstrated, but better assessed on the previous rib series radiographs. 
 There is minimal right lateral pleural thickening adjacent to the site of the
 rib fractures. Vague opacity within the right lateral lung base may reflect an
 area of contusion. No pneumothorax, focal consolidation or pleural effusion is
 clearly evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Re- demonstration of right fifth through eighth lateral rib fractures with
 adjacent right lateral pleural thickening. No pneumothorax seen. Vague opacity
 in the lateral aspect of the right lung base adjacent to the rib fractures may
 reflect a contusion.
