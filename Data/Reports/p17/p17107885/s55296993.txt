                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with chest pain, headache and head strike.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Slight increased attenuation projecting over bilateral lung
 bases is similar to prior examination and corresponds to soft tissue folds on
 the lateral view.  Lungs are clear.  Pleural surfaces are clear without
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No overt traumatic abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  No overt traumatic
 findings.  Dedicated rib series may be helpful if there is focality on
 physical exam.
