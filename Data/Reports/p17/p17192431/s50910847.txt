                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with metastatic carcinoma, bowel
 obstruction, now with diffuse rhonchi and auscultation bench.  Evaluate for
 possible infiltrates.  New mild pulmonary edema versus aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed and direct comparison
 with the next preceding similar study obtained one day earlier.  Heart size,
 thoracic aorta and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The same holds for
 the position of the left-sided PICC line and an NG tube that reaches below the
 diaphragm.  The NG tube ever has been withdrawn by about 10 cm and points now
 into the mid portion of the stomach.  Distended large bowels as before.  No
 new parenchymal densities are identified.  The lateral pleural sinuses appear
 free; however, the diffuse haze on the lung bases can be well explained
 bilateral pleural effusions layering in the posterior portion of the pleural
 spaces as the patient is in semi-erect position.  The next previous available
 PA and lateral chest examination confirmed pleural effusions on the lateral
 view was obtained on ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings in comparison with the next preceding
 portable examination one day earlier.
