                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with worsening hypoxia after cardiopulmonary
 arrest due to opiate overdose.  Evaluate for pneumonitis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.  There are dense bilateral
 perihilar and right lower lung opacities along with more diffuse nodular
 opacities, more constraint in the upper lungs bilaterally.  The left lung base
 is relatively spared.  Increased lucency at the right lung base is suspicious
 for pneumothorax.  There is no pleural effusion.  The stomach is distended. 
 No displaced fracture is identified.  The heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The opacities described above likely represent pneumonitis secondary to
 aspiration, however, the more widespread distribution suggests a concurrent
 process such as pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Lucency above the right hemidiaphragm is suspicious for pneumothorax
 (however this was not seen on subsequent chest CT.
 
 3.  No fracture is identified.
