                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new endotracheal tube placement.  Evaluate
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier the same date, taken approximately
 40 minutes previously.  A new endotracheal tube has been placed and terminates
 appropriately 4.8 cm above the carina.  In the short interval since the prior
 study, the pulmonary opacities are largely unchanged, but there is a
 suggestion that there has been further consolidation of left lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
 2.  Interval increase in the opacities seen in the left lung in the short
 ___-minute intervals since the prior study, suggesting acutely worsening
 pulmonary edema.
