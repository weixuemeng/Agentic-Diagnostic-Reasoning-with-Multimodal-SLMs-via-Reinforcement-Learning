                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is dense
 consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe abutting the
 minor fissure, compatible with pneumonia.  In addition, there is vague opacity
 obscuring the left heart border projecting anteriorly in the left lower lung
 suggestive of pneumonia also within the lingula.  There appears to be a small
 right pleural effusion.  Heart size is difficult to assess.  Mediastinal
 contour is also somewhat obscured.  Bony structures appear intact.  Partially
 imaged IVC filter in the upper abdomen is noted as well as clips in the right
 upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend followup to resolution to
 exclude underlying lesion.
