                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  MS exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Subtle
 opacity along the left heart border is stable as compared to the prior study
 and may represent atelectasis/scarring or fat pad.  No focal consolidation is
 seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  Old fracture deformity
 of the posterior right eighth rib is again seen, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
