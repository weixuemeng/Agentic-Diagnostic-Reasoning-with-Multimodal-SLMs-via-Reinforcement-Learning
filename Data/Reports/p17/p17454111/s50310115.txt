                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of diabetes
 mellitus, hypertension, COPD and prior MI with acute dyspnea.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Since the prior study, there has been interval resolution of pulmonary edema. 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable.  Chronic interstitial
 changes laterally are most likely consistent with interstitial lung disease. 
 No pleural effusion is seen.  Hyperinflation is noted.  No pneumothorax is
 present.
