                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung
 base may reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are demonstrated.  Remote bilateral rib fractures are again
 noted.  Mild degenerative changes are seen in the imaged thoracic spine as
 well as within both acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
