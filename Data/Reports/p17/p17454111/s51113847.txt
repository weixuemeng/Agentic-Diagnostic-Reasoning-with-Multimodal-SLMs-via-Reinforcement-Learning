                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Short of breath, question retrocardiac opacity.  
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS INCLUDING A LATERAL VIEW, DONE AS A SUPPLEMENT TO A FRONTAL
 VIEW FROM ___ AT 6:40 A.M.  
 
 Of note, on the frontal view, there has been interval increase in the degree
 of opacity at the right base.  Allowing for differences in positioning,
 findings at the left base are probably similar.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, with a suggestion of increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
 There are small bilateral pleural effusions posteriorly.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Upper zone re-distribution and vascular congestion, which appears to have
 progressed slightly since this morning.  
 
 2.  Right greater than left opacities at both bases.  This may represent
 atelectasis, with vascular engorgement.  However, the possibility of early
 pneumonic infiltrates cannot be entirely excluded.  Small posterior bilateral
 effusions noted.
