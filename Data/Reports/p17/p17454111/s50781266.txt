                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  There is probable background hyperinflation suggestive
 of COPD.  There is mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration. 
 The aorta is calcified and unfolded.  There is upper zone redistribution. 
 There are streaky opacities at left greater than right base.  No frank
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.   Previously identified old
 healed rib fractures are less well demonstrated on the current exam due to
 slight differences in positioning.
 
 Compared to ___ and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt
 significant interval change.
  
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Probable COPD.  Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, but no overt
 CHF.
 
 2.  Streaky opacities at left greater than right bases, similar to ___. 
 No frank consolidation identified.  If there is high concern for a focal
 infiltrate, then a lateral view may help to more completely assess the lower
 lobes.
