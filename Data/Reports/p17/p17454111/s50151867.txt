                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new onset CO2 retention and edema //
 pneumonia, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  AP and lateral chest radiographs ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Asymmetric pulmonary vascular engorgement in the right lung with minimal
 vascular engorgement in the left lung which may be asymmetric pulmonary edema
 or gravitational edema and less likely superimposed pneumonia, correlate
 clinically.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Cardiac size appears slightly
 enlarged compared to previous with widening of the mediastinal contours, but
 this may be related to positioning.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric pulmonary vascular engorgement on the right which suggest
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or gravitational edema from positioning, and may
 represent superimposed pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions
