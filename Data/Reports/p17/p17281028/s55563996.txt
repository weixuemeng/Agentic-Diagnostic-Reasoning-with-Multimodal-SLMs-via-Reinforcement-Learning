                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with shortness of
 breath, hypoxia, SIADH.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device
 with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette remains normal.  Lung volumes are lower, resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, but right base
 opacity is increased.  No large pneumothorax identified.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged retrocardiac opacity.  Increased right base opacity.
