                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  New onset of dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and PET-CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a dual lead pacemaker/ICD device in place. Cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear unchanged. There are new small pleural effusions and a
 diffuse mild new interstitial abnormality suggesting mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema. Opacities at the left lung base appear increased but were
 present before and may be due to waxing and waning chronic atelectasis; active
 infectious process is not excluded, however.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest new mild interstitial pulmonary edema including small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Persistent, somewhat increased left lower lobe
 opacification, probably consistent with waxing and waning atelectasis although
 a superimposed infectious process is hard to entirely exclude.
