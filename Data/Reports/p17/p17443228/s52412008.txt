 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:54 PM
  2 AP images of the chest show an endotracheal tube initially within the right
  mainstem bronchus and an essentially at the level above the carina. Recommend
  pulling back the endotracheal tube approximately 2-3 cm for appropriate
  positioning.
  
  Lung volumes are low without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
  pneumothorax.
  
  
  Findings communicated to Dr. ___ ___ via telephone at 19:51 on ___ immediately upon discovery by Dr. ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with variceal bleed s/p intubation  // Assess for ETT
 placement      Assess for ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ at 08:08.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The second of two views of the chest shows the ET tube still at the carina,
 3.5 cm below optimal placement.
 
 Lung volumes are lower and mild pulmonary edema is new.  Consolidation in the
 left lower lobe is probably a combination of edema and atelectasis, but needs
 to be followed to exclude aspiration pneumonia, particularly given the history
 of hematemesis.
 
 What is most striking is the severe acute distension of mediastinal veins,
 most prominently the azygos, in the right tracheobronchial angle.  The azygos
 was already mildly dilated earlier in the day, but not in ___, so it is not a
 congenital finding. Therefore causes of acute azygos distention should be
 reviewed clinically, including cirrhosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, inferior vena
 cava thrombosis, right heart failure, and less likely because of pulmonary
 edema, cardiac tamponade due to pericardial effusion.
