                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with suspected atelectasis
 versus consolidation seen on the prior radiograph.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained on ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly with prominence of the left ventricle is redemonstrated. 
 Mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  There is linear opacity at the left
 lung base most likely reflecting atelectasis  . The rest of the lungs are
 essentially clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
