 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The lungs are

 Dedicated PA and lateral views to be helpful for further evaluation.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains top normal to mildly enlarged.  The patient is
 status post median sternotomy and CABG.  There is slight blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, which could be due to pleural thickening or a trace
 effusion.  Degenerative changes at the right acromioclavicular joint are
 noted.

 aspiration.  PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.
 2.  Chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
