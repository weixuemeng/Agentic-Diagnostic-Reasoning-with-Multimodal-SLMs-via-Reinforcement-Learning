                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M pedestrian struck with left open tib/fib fracture, now s/p
 left tibial IMN and I D with possible left lower lobe infiltrate seen on spine
 films.  // eval left lower lobe infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Multifocal linear opacities in the mid and lower lungs are
 suggestive of atelectasis. A patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region
 has slightly improved since recent thoracic spine radiograph of earlier the
 same date and may reflect atelectasis or spinal aspiration.  Possible small
 pleural effusions are evident on the lateral view.
