                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with gallstone pancreatitis status post
 embolization of the splenic pseudoaneurysm with respiratory failure status
 post left chest tube removal, question pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted and compared to
 prior study of ___ at 8:34.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the left pleural catheter with no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  There is increasing linear opacity at the left base most likely
 reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  In addition, there are likely small
 effusions, right greater than left.  Patchy opacity at the right base likely
 reflects compressive atelectasis.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  A feeding
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 
 Embolization coil is seen projecting over the left upper quadrant in this
 patient status post embolization of a splenic pseudoaneurysm.  Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation
 between the studies.
