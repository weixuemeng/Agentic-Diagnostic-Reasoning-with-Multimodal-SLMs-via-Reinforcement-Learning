 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion, questionable pneumothorax, evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was
 inserted into the right pleural space.  The right pleural effusion is
 completely drained.  There is no evidence for the presence of a right
 pneumothorax.  On the left, the pleural effusion persists in unchanged manner.

 heart is unchanged in size.  Unchanged are the other monitoring and support
 devices.
