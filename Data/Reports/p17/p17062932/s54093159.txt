 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:58 PM
  Dobbhoff tube ends within the stomach, unchanged.  Right PICC ends near the
  superior cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  Ovoid lucency projecting over the
  medial right lung base is thought to correspond to a tongue of aerated right
  lower lobe parenchyma, as seen on the recent CT from ___.  There
  is no pneumothorax.  A moderate right pleural effusion is not significantly
  changed.  Moderate right and mild left lower lung atelectasis is unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:40 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Pseudoaneurysm.  Recent Dobbhoff placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There is no pneumothorax.  A moderate right pleural effusion has
 changed in distribution, probably larger as well.  Extent of right lower lobe
 atelectasis is hard to assess, could be considerable.  Left upper lung is
 clear.  Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung has been
 present since ___, presumably atelectasis but raising question of
 chronic aspiration.  Heart is normal size.  Feeding tube with a wire stylet in
 place ends in the upper stomach.  Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Small
 left pleural effusion may be present.  No pneumothorax.
