                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No priors radiographs for comparison.  Comparison is made to CT abdomen of
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Bibasilar
 patchy and linear opacities are present as well as small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Oral contrast is present within diverticula in the imaged portion
 of the upper abdomen, likely related to recent contrast CT scan.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities favor atelectasis, but aspiration is
 an additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
