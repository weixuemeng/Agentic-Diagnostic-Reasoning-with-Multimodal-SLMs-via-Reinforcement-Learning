                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with fever and leukocytosis.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.

 metallic nipple piercings overlie the inferior aspect of the lungs on the
 frontal view, obscuring detail behind them.  Nevertheless, the lungs are
 clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
