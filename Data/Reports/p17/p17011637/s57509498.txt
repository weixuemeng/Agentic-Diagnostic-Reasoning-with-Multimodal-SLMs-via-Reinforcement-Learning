                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, likely exaggerated
 by AP technique.  The mediastinal contours demonstrate a prominent right upper
 contour and a lack of a left-sided aortic knob, suggestive of a right-sided
 aorta, confirmed on localizer images from ___ spinal MR.  ___ hilar
 contours are within normal limits. The lung volumes are low with bibasilar
 opacities, most compatible with atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Probable bibasilar atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical
 setting, pneumonia must be considered.
 2. Right-sided aortic arch.
