                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain, asthma exacerbation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with the superior mediastinum slightly widened likely
 due to reduced lung volumes.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There is
 minimal subsegmental atelectasis in left lung base.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Amorphous calcification
 adjacent to the greater tuberosities bilaterally may reflect calcific
 tendinopathy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
