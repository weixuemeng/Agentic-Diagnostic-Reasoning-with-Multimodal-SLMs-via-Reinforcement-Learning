                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate unchanged mild cardiomegaly
 and upper zone vascular redistribution, without frank edema. Lungs are
 moderately well aerated.  A left retrocardiac opacity could represent an early
 pneumonia or sequela of aspiration. No pleural or pericardial effusion is
 identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left retrocardiac opacity could represent an early pneumonia or sequela of
 aspiration. Short-term followup chest radiograph to document resolution is
 recommended.
