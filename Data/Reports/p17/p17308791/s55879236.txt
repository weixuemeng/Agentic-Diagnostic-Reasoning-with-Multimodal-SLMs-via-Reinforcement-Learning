                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F s/p fall now with syncopal episode and dens
 fracture.  // eval for CHF versus PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There may be slight upper retraction of the
 hila likely due to chronic changes at the right greater than left lung apices.
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.
 Surgical clips are noted overlying the right lateral lower hemithorax. 
 Multiple left-sided chronic appearing rib deformities are seen which suggest
 prior fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 COPD without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly.
