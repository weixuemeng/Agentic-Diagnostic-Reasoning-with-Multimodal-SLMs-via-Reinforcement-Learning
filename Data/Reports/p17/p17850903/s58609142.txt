                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Weakness, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  There are clips
 again noted in the left upper quadrant.  There has been interval development
 of a small right pleural effusion with increasing ground-glass opacity at the
 right lower lung which could indicate pneumonia.  There is mild blunting of
 the left CP angle which is stable and may represent a chronic small effusion
 or pleural thickening.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear stable. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
 Subtle opacity at the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.
