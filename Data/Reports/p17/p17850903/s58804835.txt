                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness on interferon.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The lungs are clear of consolidation or large effusion. 
 There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as on prior with less clear
 delineation of posterior costophrenic angle, potentially related to a small
 effusion versus atelectasis/scarring.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within
 normal limits.  Osseous structures again notable for post-thoracotomy changes
 on the left.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of confluent consolidation.  New mild blunting of the
 left posterior costophrenic angle, potentially due to scarring/atelectasis
 versus trace effusion.
