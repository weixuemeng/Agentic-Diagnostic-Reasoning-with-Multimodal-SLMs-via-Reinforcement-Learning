                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe COPD now with worsening cough. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Multiple endobronchial valves project over the right lung.  The right upper
 lobe is not collapsing. Severe emphysema is present.  Peribronchial cuffing in
 the bilateral lower lobes and bilateral basilar opacities right greater than
 left, are consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.  No significant pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The heart size is normal.  There are
 aortic knob calcifications.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Peribronchial cuffing and, right greater than left, basilar opacities are
 consistent with pneumonia or aspiration in the correct clinical setting. 
 Follow-up radiograph in 4 weeks is recommended to document resolution.
