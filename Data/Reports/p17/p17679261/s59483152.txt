                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with altered mental status  // ?pna, fluid
 status      ?pna, fluid status
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 04:22
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 01:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is increasing consolidation in the
 retrocardiac region which is likely associated with a layering effusion. 
 Although these findings could represent compressive atelectasis of the left
 lower low, pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered in the correct
 clinical setting.  Patchy opacity at the right base is stable favoring
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
