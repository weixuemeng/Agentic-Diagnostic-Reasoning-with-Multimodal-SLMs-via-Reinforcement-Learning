                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p dual chamber PPM implant  // check for lead
 position and pnx
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest x-ray
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest x-rays dating from ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a dual lead permanent pacemaker is seen with pacemaker
 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle without evidence of
 mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.  A right PICC line is in the catheter
 tip projecting over the right atrium.  There is stable right lower lobe volume
 loss secondary to atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
 mild interstitial edema.  The cardiac silhouette moderately enlarged and
 stable from previous studies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Placement transvenous pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium
 and right ventricle.
 2. Right PICC line with catheter tip terminating in the right atrium.
 3. Stable right lower lobe volume loss secondary to atelectasis and small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 4. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
