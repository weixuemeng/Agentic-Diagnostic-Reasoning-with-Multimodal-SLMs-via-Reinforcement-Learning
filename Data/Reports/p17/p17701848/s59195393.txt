                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is unremarkable.  Bilateral perihilar
 interstitial opacities are most likely consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 Underlying infectious process might be obscured, in particular in the right
 lower lung.  Evaluation of the patient after diuresis is recommended.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot
 be excluded.
