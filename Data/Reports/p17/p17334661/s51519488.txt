                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Confusion, evaluation for right lung base, elevated white blood
 cell count.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal blunting of the left and right costophrenic sinus persists. 
 On the previous radiograph, this blunting had no morphological correlate on
 the lateral chest x-ray.  The lung volumes are low.  Minimal atelectasis at
 both lung bases.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  The feeding tube and the right PICC line are
 normal in appearance.
