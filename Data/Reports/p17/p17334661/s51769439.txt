                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
  Likely pancreatic cancer, recently discharged after PTC placement complicated
 by aspiration and ARDS.  Now presenting with nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided PICC tip terminates in the proximal right atrium.  The right
 internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed.  The heart size is
 normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in
 size compared to the previous exam.  There is improved aeration of the lung
 bases with minimal residual atelectasis.  No new areas of focal consolidation
 are demonstrated.  There is no pneumothorax.  Percutaneous transhepatic
 biliary catheter is partially imaged.  There are mild degenerative changes in
 the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in aeration of the lung bases with residual atelectasis,
 and decreasing small bilateral pleural effusions.
