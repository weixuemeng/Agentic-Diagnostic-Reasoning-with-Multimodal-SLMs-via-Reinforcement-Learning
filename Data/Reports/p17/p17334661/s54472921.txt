                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following
 recent bronchoscopy procedure.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved.  Left lower lobe
 atelectasis has slightly improved, but there is worsening atelectasis at the
 right lung base adjacent to a small-to-moderate pleural effusion.  Small left
 pleural effusion is similar to the prior study.  Note is made of marked
 gastric distention within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
