                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right upper lobe endobronchial lesion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable including some tortuosity of the aorta. 
 As compared to the prior study, there is substantial improvement in the right
 upper lobe consolidation with still present opacities in the apical aspect of
 the lobe.  The suspected at least partial obstruction of the right upper lobe
 bronchus is better depicted on the prior CT and chest radiograph.  Left lung
 is essentially clear and there is no pleural effusion demonstrated.  For
 precise details, please review the CT torso from ___ and
 corresponding report.
