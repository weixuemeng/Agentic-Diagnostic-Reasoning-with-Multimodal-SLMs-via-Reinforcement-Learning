                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post right upper lobe lobectomy, 2 chest tubes in place. 
 Question pneumothorax, worsening opacities.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right chest tubes remain in position.  An epidural catheter is unchanged.  The
 right apical pneumothorax is minimally bigger since yesterday with no evidence
 of tension.  Interstitial opacities worse on the right than the left, likely
 asymmetric pulmonary edema not significantly changed from yesterday. 
 Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis or consolidation. No change in
 subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right apical pneumothorax is minimally larger since yesterday.
 
 2. Right-greater-than-left interstitial opacities, likely asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, are unchanged from yesterday.
 
 3. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, could represent atelectasis
 or consolidation, gradually worsening over the last 3 days.
