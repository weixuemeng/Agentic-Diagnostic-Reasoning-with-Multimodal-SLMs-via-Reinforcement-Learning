                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating between ___ and ___ as well as a chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heterogeneous consolidation in the right upper lobe has partially improved
 since the prior CT, but there remains considerable consolidation present at
 the right apex and centrally in the juxtahilar region.  Additionally, there is
 a persistent unusual tubular opacity projecting from the right hilar region
 which could represent an impacted airway.  Lungs remain hyperexpanded and
 hyperlucent consistent with previously documented emphysema on prior CT. 
 Heart size is normal, and aorta is mildly tortuous.  No pleural effusions or
 acute skeletal abnormalities were detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Incomplete clearing of right upper lobe pneumonia, for which CT evaluation is
 recommended, particularly given the presence of right upper lobe segmental
 bronchial obstruction on prior CT of ___.  If bronchial obstruction
 is persistent or progressive on repeat CT, bronchoscopy would be recommended
 to exclude airway malignancy as a potential cause of this nonresolving right
 upper lobe pneumonia.
 
 Findings entered into radiology communications dashboard on ___.
