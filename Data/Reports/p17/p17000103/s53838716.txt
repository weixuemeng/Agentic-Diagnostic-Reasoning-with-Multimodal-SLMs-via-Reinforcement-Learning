                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumonia and known
 severe COPD.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 There is substantial improvement in still present consolidations in the left
 upper lung.  There is also improvement with still present opacity in right
 upper lung, with a substantially more extensive involvement of the lobe as
 compared to the left.  Lucencies are noted bilaterally may potentially reflect
 cavitations versus bulla.  There are no new consolidations.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 Findings might reflect gradual slow resolution of the pneumonia in the
 presence of emphysema.  Alternatively, especially given the presence of
 continuous symptoms, not resolving infection cannot be excluded and wheezing
 the upper lobe predisposition, mycobacterial tuberculosis infection, either
 typical or atypical, cannot be entirely excluded.  Further assessment with
 chest CT is recommended.
 
 Findings communicated via e-mail to Dr ___
