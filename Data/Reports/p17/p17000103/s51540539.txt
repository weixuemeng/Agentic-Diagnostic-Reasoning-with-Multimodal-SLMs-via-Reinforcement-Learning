                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CT COPD, low-grade temperature and increased sputum and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are unchanged signs of marked overinflation.
 
 Newly appeared are relatively extensive parenchymal opacities in the right
 upper lobe and in the left upper lobe.  Additional opacities are seen at the
 bases of the right upper lobe.
 
 In the appropriate clinical context, the findings are consistent with
 multifocal pneumonia.  At the time of observation and dictation, 11:41 a.m.,
 on ___, the referring physician, ___. ___ was paged for notification
 and the findings were subsequently discussed over the telephone.
 
 No reactive pleural effusions.  No cardiomegaly, no hilar or mediastinal
 changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia in a patient with massive overinflation,
 likely caused by COPD.  Resolution after therapy should be documented by chest
 radiography in 8 to 10 weeks, to confirm the absence of other parenchymal
 abnormalities.
