                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with s/p cardiac surgery- reintubated, evaluate
 for endotracheal tube position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors with direct comparison made to study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina in
 appropriate position. Remaining support and monitoring devices including
 bilateral chest tubes, right IJ central venous catheter are in unchanged
 positions. The tip of the nasogastric tube courses out of the field of view of
 this study.
 
 There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly as well as mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. Previously seen layering right pleural effusion has largely
 cleared but this appearance could also be due to upright positioning of
 patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina in
 appropriate position.
 
 2.  Likely interval improvement in right pleural effusion, though this could
 also be explained by upright patient positioning. Persistent moderate
 cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion.
