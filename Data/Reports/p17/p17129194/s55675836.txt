                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with failure to wean  // interval chnage     
 interval chnage
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, there is increasing opacification at the
 right base suggesting layering pleural effusion and atelectasis.  There is
 also a less prominent opacification at the left base consistent with pleural
 fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Monitoring and support devices
 show little change except for proximal migration of the Dopp off to so that
 the opaque tip appears to straddles the esophagogastric junction.
