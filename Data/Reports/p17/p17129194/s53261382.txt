                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right chest tube removal. Recent CABG.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP semi-upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is somewhat lower than before, now terminating only about
 1 cm above the carina. A right-sided chest tube has been removed. There is
 streaky associated density suggesting atelectasis but no evidence of
 pneumothorax. Otherwise, there has been no significant change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube somewhat lower than before; it may be appropriate to
 retract somewhat since it now lies about 1 cm above the carina.
 
 2.  Areas of atelectasis but no pneumothorax following interval removal of
 right-sided chest tube.
