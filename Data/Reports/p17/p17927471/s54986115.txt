                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with new diagnosis of scleroderma and
 shortness of breath.  Evaluate for possible interstitial fibrosis.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. 
 The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormalities identified.  Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic
 parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral and posterior pleural
 sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax in the apical area on frontal view.
 
 The pa frontal and lateral views do not demonstrate changes that are
 suspicious for interstitial fibrosis.  Should assessment of early
 manifestations be essential, it is recommended to perform a high-resolution
 chest CT which is known to be more sensitive for such evaluation.  Our records
 do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison with
 today's examination.
