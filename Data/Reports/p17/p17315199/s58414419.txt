 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, tachycardia, assess for pneumonia or
 CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided.  The heart is
 markedly enlarged.  There is mild pulmonary edema with opacity in the lower
 lungs, left greater than right, which could indicate effusion, though
 consolidation is also a concern.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Massive cardiomegaly.  Consider echocardiogram to exclude
 pericardial effusion.  Small effusions, mild edema and possible consolidation
 at the left lung base.
