 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p fall down 5 stairs. Intubated for
 combativeness  // assess ETT placement
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 Impression ends at the level of the diaphragm an would need to be it a
 advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.  The comparison
 chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Rotation explains only some of the apparent
 rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, but I
 see no appreciable atelectasis.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is no pleural
 effusion.  Angulation of the ribs may be due to nondisplaced fractures of the
 right and left nineth ribs.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 Conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or
 characterization of chest cage trauma Any focal findings should be clearly
 marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
