                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 within normal limits.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Streaky
 opacities at the left lung base suggests minor atelectasis. A oval nodular
 opacity projecting over the left upper lung is of uncertain significance. 
 There is a moderate hiatal hernia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Possible pulmonary nodule in the left upper lung.  When clinically
 appropriate evaluation with repeat PA and bilateral oblique views is
 recommended to see whether the opacity may persist or perhaps represent an
 artifact, versus consideration of chest CT.
 
 2.  Suspected minor left basilar atelectasis.
 
 3.  Moderate hiatal hernia.
