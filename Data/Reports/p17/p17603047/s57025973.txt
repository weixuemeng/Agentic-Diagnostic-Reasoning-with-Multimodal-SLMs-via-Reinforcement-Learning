                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The hyperinflated lungs are clear.  The
 hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is a small calcified
 granuloma in the left upper lobe, stable from the prior study.  Bilateral
 apical pleural scarring is also unchanged.  There is atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aortic arch as well as stable tortuosity.  There is no
 gross rib deformity.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  No acute rib fracture is seen; however, this study is not optimal for the
 detection of subtle nondisplaced rib fractures.  If there is continued
 clinical concern, a dedicated rib series is recommended.
 3.  Findings suggestive of COPD.
