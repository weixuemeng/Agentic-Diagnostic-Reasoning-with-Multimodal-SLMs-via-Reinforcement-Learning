                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, assess for CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate vague
 reticular opacity at the left lung base, which could represent atelectasis or
 scarring, though the possibility of a very early pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  The right lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is difficult to
 assess, but appears within normal limits in size.  Mediastinal contour is
 normal.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague linear opacity at the left lung base, partially obscuring
 left heart border, could represent scarring/atelectasis, though pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  Please correlate clinically.
