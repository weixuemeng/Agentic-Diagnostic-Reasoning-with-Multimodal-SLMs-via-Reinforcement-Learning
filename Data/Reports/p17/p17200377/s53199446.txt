                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with one episode of posttussive vomiting.  // Please
 evaluate for evidence of aspiration/pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low lung volumes. Left mid to lower lung and right basilar
 atelectasis is seen. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggesting a small pleural effusion. Right pleural effusion appears to have
 decreased since interval although this may in part relate to differences in
 patient positioning. A trace left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude
 although no large left pleural effusion is seen. No evidence of pneumothorax
 is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Old right-sided
 rib fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small-moderate pleural effusion appears possibly slightly decreased in the
 size since the prior study, although this may relate to differences in patient
 positioning.
 
 Areas of bilateral atelectasis/scarring.
