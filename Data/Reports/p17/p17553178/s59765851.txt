                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with persistent cough and fever,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
 abnormality is identified.  Thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but
 no local contour abnormalities are identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not congested.  No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are
 present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Somewhat low
 positioned and flattened diaphragms suggestive of COPD; however, acute
 infiltrates cannot be identified.  There is no pneumothorax in the apical
 area.  Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for
 comparison.
