                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p  CABG  // eval for pleural effusions     
 eval for pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Bilateral asymmetric alveolar and
 interstitial opacities may be slightly improved.  Again there consistent with
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, possibly with superimposed infectious pneumonia or
 aspiration.  The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen.  This could
 represent improvement in pleural effusion, or merely be a manifestation of a
 more erect position of the patient.
