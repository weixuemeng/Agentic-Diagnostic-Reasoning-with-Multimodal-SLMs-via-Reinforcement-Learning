 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MODS  // interval change      interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:12
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 07:26 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent more focal areas of consolidation in the left mid and lower lung
 are seen and could reflect pneumonia. However, there is increasing pulmonary
 opacities bilaterally suggesting that these findings could solely reflect
 worsening asymmetric moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation
 is recommended.  No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  Probable small layering
 effusions.  Patient is status post median sternotomy with aortic valve
 replacement and stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Right
 subclavian central line, left internal jugular dual-lumen catheter,
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
