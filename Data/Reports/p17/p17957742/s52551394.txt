                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia s/p CABG  // eval for edema/effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  There has been an
 increase in the patchy airspace opacity seen throughout the left lung with a
 second more focal area in the right lower lung.  Although the appearances may
 reflect pulmonary edema, particularly given the waxing waning appearance over
 the last several days, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Probable
 left pleural effusion.  Support lines and tubes are unchanged in appearance
 when compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progression of the airspace opacity in the left upper and right lower lung. 
 As this has been waxing and waning, this may reflect pulmonary edema however
 infection cannot be excluded.
