                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with moderate right pneumothorax after
 nephrectomy, assess size.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 14:51.
 
 An AP upright chest film, ___ at 6:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Spinal rods overlying the visualized thoracolumbar spine.  Stable right
 moderate-sized pneumothorax.  There is also free intraperitoneal air as well
 as a lucency now surrounding a catheter in the right upper abdomen, which may
 represent loculated air within the peritoneal cavity.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  There continues to be a layering left effusion with some patchy
 retrocardiac opacity which may represent partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although an early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  There is some fullness to the perihilar vasculature, which
 may represent a fluid replete state.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.
