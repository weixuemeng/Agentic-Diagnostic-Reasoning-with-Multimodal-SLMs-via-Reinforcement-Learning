                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nephrectomy with possible aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat
 better inspiration.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bibasilar
 opacification most likely reflects small pleural effusions and atelectasis. 
 Mild continued elevation of the minor fissure.
 
 No definite evidence of pneumonia, though some of the basilar and retrocardiac
 opacification could reflect developing infiltrate in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
