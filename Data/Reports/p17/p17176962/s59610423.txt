                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional
 differences.  Moderate right pleural effusion with intrafissural component has
 slightly shifted in distribution, likely due to positional changes.  Adjacent
 opacities at the right lung base now favor atelectasis, and note is also made
 of a new area of opacity in the left retrocardiac area, which may be due to
 atelectasis or aspiration given its rapid development.
