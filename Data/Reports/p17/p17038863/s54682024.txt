                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough, congestion, and crackles.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable.  Small left
 pleural effusion that appears to be loculated is stable.  Small right pleural
 effusion is also unchanged.  Bilateral opacities have markedly improved with
 remaining larger opacities in the left lower hemithorax.  As before, this
 could correspond to a combination of atelectasis and adjacent pleural
 effusion, but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded and continued
 followup is recommended.  There are no new lung abnormalities.  Of note, the
 apices of the lungs are obscured by the patient's chin.  Sternal wires are
 aligned.  Old healed rib fractures are again noted.
