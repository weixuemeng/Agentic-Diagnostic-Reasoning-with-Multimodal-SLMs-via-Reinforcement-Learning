                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a chest CT performed approximately 20 minutes earlier.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent fall with altered mental status.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  As seen on CT,
 there are small bilateral pleural effusions with airspace opacities within the
 right upper and lower lobes and left upper and lower lobes compatible with
 pneumonia.  There is also a component of mild pulmonary edema better assessed
 on the preceding CT.  Heart is moderately enlarged.  Midline sternotomy wires
 are noted.  The left eleventh posterior rib fracture is better assessed on the
 CT.
