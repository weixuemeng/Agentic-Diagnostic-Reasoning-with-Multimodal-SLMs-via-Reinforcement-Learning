                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The patient
 is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle which
 may be due to pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening with overlying
 atelectasis.  There is a small patchy opacity in the lateral aspect of the
 right mid lung zone which may represent focus of contusion in the setting of
 trauma or infection; however, recommend short-term followup chest radiograph
 to assess for resolution and exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion. 
 Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle and right base scarring is
 again seen.  Multiple calcifications projecting over the left upper quadrant
 are consistent with patient's previously seen splenic calcifications.  Likely
 splenic artery calcification is also seen.
 
 No evidence of acute displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New small focus of patchy opacification in the lateral right mid lung,
 which could represent pulmonary contusion in the setting of trauma or
 underlying infection.  Recommend short-term followup radiographs to assess for
 resolution to exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion.
 2.  Persistent blunting of the left greater than right bilateral costophrenic
 angles likely due to pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.
