                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is small to moderate left and small right pleural effusions.  Bibasilar
 opacities may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
 although underlying infection and/or aspiration are of concern.  There are
 additional smaller patchy opacities in the mid lung zones bilaterally,
 decreased as compared to the prior study.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
 seen.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous.  Coronary
 stenting/calcification seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions.  Bibasilar opacities may represent combination of
 pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation due to
 infection and/or aspiration may be present.  Additionally, patchy opacities in
 the mid lungs bilaterally haveimproved since the prior study with residual
 remaining.  Persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
