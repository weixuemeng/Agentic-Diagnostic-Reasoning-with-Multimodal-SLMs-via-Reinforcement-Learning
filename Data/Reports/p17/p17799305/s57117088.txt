                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate mediastinum.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning, which does limit assessment of mediastinal silhouette. 
 Allowing for differences, the contours are probably grossly unchanged.  There
 is increased density at left lower lobe, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation.  A small left effusion cannot be excluded.  Small right
 effusion may also be present.  New thickening of the minor fissure is noted
 and could reflect mild fluid overload.
