  Pt is rotated.  There is mild  widening of the mediastinum with medialization
  of the aortic calcifications.  No comparisons are available to assess for
  change.  If there is concern for aortic pathology, this could represent
  intramural hematoma or dissection. Alternatively, it could be due to the
  rotation. Consider follow up with a PA/lateral.  If concern for aortic
  pathology, could get a CTA. There is probable cardiomegaly, although again
  difficult to determine due to rotation. No definite retrocardiac opacity, but
  small effusion or early left basilar pneumonia cannot be fully excluded.
  Again, a lateral view would be helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Infiltrate, effusion, cough.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, there is probable cardiomegaly,
 together with prominence of the superior mediastinum.  The aortic
 calcifications may be medialized.  
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Doubt CHF. Atelectasis at right base and
 possible minimal pleural fluid in the right costophrenic angle. ? tiny
 calcified granuloma right upper zone.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and possible distortion of
 the aortic calcifications.  While this may be accentuated by rotation, it
 raises the question of aortic pathology/hematoma.  If clinically indicated, PA
 and lateral chest radiographs or, alternatively, a CTA could help for further
 assessment.  Please see wet reading provided by radiology resident, Dr. ___,
 on the evening of ___.
 
 2.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity suggesting left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  This, too, could be more definitively assessed on a PA and
 lateral CXR or on a CT scan.
