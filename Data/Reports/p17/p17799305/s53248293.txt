                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Second postoperative day after open cholecystectomy.  The patient
 confused, question pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to baseline, ___:
 
 Left lower lung is entirely airless.  Since there has previously been some
 volume loss on that side, I suspect this is chronic recurrent collapse, but it
 raises questions about aspiration or retained secretions.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged, unchanged.  The calcified aortic knob is discernable and widened
 upper mediastinum which could be due to fat and dilated head and neck vessels.
 If there is clinical need to define vascular anatomy, CTA would be required.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged.
