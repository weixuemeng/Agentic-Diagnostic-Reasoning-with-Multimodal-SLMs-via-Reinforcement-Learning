                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with prior CVA.  Evaluation for evidence of
 ongoing aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___; ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Since the prior
 study, there has been much improvement in the bilateral lung base
 consolidations likely representing atelectasis.  There has also been
 improvement in the previously seen bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 evidence of congestive heart failure or prominent pulmonary edema.  There is
 no new focal consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax.  The previously seen
 left subclavian line remains in standard position, terminating in the upper
 SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Much improved bilateral lung base atelectasis and bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No new focal consolidation, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.
