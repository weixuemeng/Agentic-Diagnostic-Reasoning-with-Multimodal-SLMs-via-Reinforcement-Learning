                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough x2 weeks. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal lateral chest radiographs demonstrate a normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and well-aerated lungs. Bronchial wall thickening is consistent
 with chronic bronchitis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bronchial wall thickening is consistent with chronic bronchitis. No focal
 consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia identified.
