                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Previous cardiac enlargement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been substantial increase in the size of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette due to new cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  There is no
 azygous distention to indicate elevated central venous pressure or volume, so
 if there is substantial pericardial effusion, it is not hemodynamically
 significant.  Tiny bilateral pleural effusion is in place.  Pulmonary
 vascularity is not appreciably engorged and there is no edema or focal
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  Findings were discussed by telephone with
 Dr. ___ at the time of this dictation.
