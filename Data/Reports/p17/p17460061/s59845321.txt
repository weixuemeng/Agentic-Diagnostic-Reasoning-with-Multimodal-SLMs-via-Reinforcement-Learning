                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic injury with pregnancy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There are hazy opacifications bilaterally with poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm.  This could represent layering pleural
 effusions.  Pulmonary vascularity appears to be essentially within normal
 limits.
