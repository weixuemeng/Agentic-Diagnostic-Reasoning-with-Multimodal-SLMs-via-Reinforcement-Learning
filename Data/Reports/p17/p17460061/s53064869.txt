                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of left internal jugular vascular catheter with no
 pneumothorax.  Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position.  Cardiac
 silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, and accompanied by mild increase
 in pulmonary vasculature caliber, which may relate to the patient's recent
 pregnancy status.  Hazy opacities in the mid to lower lungs bilaterally likely
 reflect layering effusions, left greater than right, but coexisting edema is
 certainly possible.  Bilateral retrocardiac atelectasis is also demonstrated. 
 Surgical clips are present in the upper abdomen in keeping with recent
 C-section.
