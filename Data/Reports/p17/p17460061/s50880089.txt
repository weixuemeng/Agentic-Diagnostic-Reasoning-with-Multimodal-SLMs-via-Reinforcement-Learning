                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Clinical suspicion for ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study from ___.
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is substantial progression of the
 abnormalities including development of right lung consolidations involving
 almost the entire right lung, distention of the azygos vein in development of
 perihilar consolidations and most likely pleural effusions.  Although no
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen or definitive apical hematoma is present on
 the right, assessment with chest CT is required to exclude the possibility of
 traumatic injury by the insertion of the right internal jugular line.  
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
