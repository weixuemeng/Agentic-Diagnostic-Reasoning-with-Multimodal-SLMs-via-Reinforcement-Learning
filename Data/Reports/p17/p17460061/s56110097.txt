 edema persist.  Bibasilar atelectasis persists.  Heart and mediastinal
 contours are similar.  Right internal jugular, left internal jugular,
 esophageal catheter, and endotracheal tube are similarly positioned, with
 endotracheal tube tip approximately 5 cm above the carina just above the level
 of the clavicles.  No pneumothorax is detected on this view.
