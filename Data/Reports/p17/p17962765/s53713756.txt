                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  A left lingular airspace
 opacity obscures the left heart border.  Right basilar airspace opacities are
 new since ___.  The pulmonary vasculature is more prominent since
 the prior study.  Atelectasis along the right minor fissure is unchanged. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Lingular and right basilar airspace opacities compatible with multifocal
 pneumonia.  In addition there is likely some component of interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
