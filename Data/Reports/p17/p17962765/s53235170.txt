                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multifocal MRSA pneumonia who continues to spike fevers after
 three days after antibiotics.  Evaluate for effusion or change in appearance
 of infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest, most recent ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Two PA and two lateral upright radiographs of the chest are
 submitted for interpretation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  The bilateral pulmonary edema is
 improved and the size of the azygos vein and vascular pedicle is smaller. 
 Fluid in the middle fissure has resolved.  However, multifocal bilateral areas
 of consolidation remain and are not significantly changed.  Additionally, a
 new focus of consolidation in the left upper lobe may represent a new focus of
 pneumonia or in the right clinical setting, pulmonary infarct.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and
 pleural surfaces appear normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significant improvement in pulmonary edema.
 2.  Unchanged multifocal bilateral opacities.
 3.  New focus of opacity in the left upper lobe may represent a new focus of
 pneumonia or if in the setting of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia and pleuritic
 chest pain may represent a pulmonary infarct.
 
 The above results were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___
 ___ at 3:20 p.m. on ___.
