                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, PA AND LATERAL.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with chronic dementia and diabetes,
 admitted with acute mental status change and hypoglycemia, now appears to be
 aspirating.  Evaluate for aspiration pneumonitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient's condition required examination in sitting upright
 position using AP frontal and left lateral views.  Comparison is made with a
 preceding similar examination dated ___.  Cardiac enlargement as
 before.  Unchanged appearance of previously described permanent pacer in left
 anterior axillary position connected to ICD cable terminating in right
 ventricle.  Comparison of the frontal views demonstrates that the previously
 present moderately distended pulmonary vasculature has regressed and also the
 evidence of some fluid in the minor fissure has disappeared.  As before, there
 is still some evidence of small amounts of pleural effusion accumulating in
 the posterior pleural sinuses, but there is no evidence of any discrete local
 pneumonic infiltrate suggesting that new aspiration pneumonia has occurred.
 
 Review of several previous chest examinations during ___ shows that the
 patient has had episodes of CHF with interstitial edema on the bases and some
 pleural effusion before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement of pulmonary congestive pattern during the latest
 examination interval.  No progression of acute pulmonary infiltrates that
 would suggest major aspiration pneumonitis.
