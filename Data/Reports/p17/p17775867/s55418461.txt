                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Weakness.  Evaluate for occult pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema; streaky left
 medial basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is an eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable within the limitations of technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process; streaky left basilar opacity is likely
 to represent minor atelectasis or scarring.
 2.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
 3.  Right diaphragmatic eventration.
