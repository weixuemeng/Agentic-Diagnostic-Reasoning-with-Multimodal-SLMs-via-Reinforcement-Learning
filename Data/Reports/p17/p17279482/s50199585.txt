 FINDINGS:
 
 Single portable view of the chest.  NG tube is seen with tip past the GE

 advanced for optimal positioning.  There is new right basilar opacity not seen
 on prior.  Less conspicuous retrocardiac opacity is also seen but similar to
 prior.  Superiorly the lungs are notable for biapical calcified likely pleural
 based scarring.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Dual lead pacing device again noted.

 NG tube with tip past the GE junction with side port likely in the distal
 esophagus and should be advanced.  New right basilar opacity suspicious for
