 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old having an exploratory laparotomy for SBO.  Ileus
 resolved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 Heart size is top normal, increased since ___.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions are new.  Lungs are grossly clear.  Atrioventricular pacer
 leads in standard placements.  Because of radiographic technique, I might not
 be able to see a small pneumothorax.
 
 Air filled gut in the right upper quadrant interposed between the diaphragm
 and liver should not be mistaken for pneumoperitoneum.
 
 Thoracic aorta is generally large and heavily calcified, but not focally
 aneurysmal.
