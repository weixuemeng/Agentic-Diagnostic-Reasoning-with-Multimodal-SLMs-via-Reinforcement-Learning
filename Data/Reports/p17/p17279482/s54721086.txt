                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased left breath sounds, evaluate for pneumonia versus
 aspiration.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in an
 upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 As compared to the prior examination, the lungs are now slightly better
 aerated.  Redemonstrated are bilateral basilar opacities, right greater than
 left, which likely represent pneumonia versus aspiration.  These opacities are
 now slightly improved as compared to prior examination.  The left
 hemi-diaphragm is noted to be somewhat obscured, probably secondary to left
 lower lobe volume loss.  There is no overt pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or
 pulmonary edema identified.  The heart size is top-normal.  The aorta is
 moderately tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable.  A
 left pectoral pacemaker is seen with leads terminating in right atrium and
 right ventricle.  A nasogastric tube in the stomach, with one side hole
 localized above the level of the esophagogastric junction.
