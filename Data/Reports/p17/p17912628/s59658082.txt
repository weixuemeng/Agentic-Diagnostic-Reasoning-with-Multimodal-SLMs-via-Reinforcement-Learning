                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest discomfort, dyspnea on exertion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Increased
 opacity in the medial right lung base may be due to overlapping vascular
 structures; however, an underlying consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  There is minor left basilar atelectasis.  No
 large pleural effusion seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Hilar contours are grossly
 stable.
