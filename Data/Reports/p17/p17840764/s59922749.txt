                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with palpitations, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and two lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained. 
 The exam is limited by low visualized lung volumes mostly secondary to highly
 convex diaphragms.  Despite these limitations, the lungs are clear.  No focal
 consolidation, nodule, or effusion is present.  There is a suggestion of a
 sclerotic lesion lesion which projects over the right first rib.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Possible lesion projecting
 over the right lung apex / supierior-anterior ribs. Followup radiograph in
 frontal and AP lordotic views is suggested.
