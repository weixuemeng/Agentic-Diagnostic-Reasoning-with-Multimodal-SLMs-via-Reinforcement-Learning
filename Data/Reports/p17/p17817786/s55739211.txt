                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Assess for interval change in patient status post right VATS
 upper lobectomy in ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ back to ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Volume loss in the right lung is evident
 with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as well as opacification of the
 right apex, which is likely now filled with soft tissue.  There is a linear
 opacity in this region which corresponds to scarring around the previous chest
 tube tract.  There is no residual pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear.  There
 is no pleural effusion.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  There has been interval normalization of the
 rightward tracheal deviation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal postoperative appearance after right upper lobectomy.
