                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with strep pneumo bacteremia, sepsis  // Eval for
 infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and mediastinal contours are normal.
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is again demonstrated as well as worsening
 bilateral interstitial opacities which may be due to interstitial edema or
 atypical infection. Patchy bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis
 based on correlation with CT abdomen images of the lung bases from earlier the
 same date.
