                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fevers, malaise
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. 
 The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications.
 Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present, with probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  A small right pleural effusion is likely
 present. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is
 detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis and probable mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Probable small right pleural effusion.
