                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubated transfer from OSH with reported pna 
 // Please eval for pna and ETT placement. thanks
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube
 terminates in the stomach and could be advanced 4-5 cm for ideal positioning
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is
 calcification of the aortic knob.  Multifocal opacities throughout both lungs
 suggest pneumonia and possibly an element of mild pulmonary edema.  There is
 no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube would need
 to be advanced 4-5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.  Multifocal
 opacities likely reflect multifocal pneumonia and possibly an element of mild
 pulmonary edema.
