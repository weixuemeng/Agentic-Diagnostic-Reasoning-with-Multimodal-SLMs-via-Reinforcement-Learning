 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 05:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting
 over the stomach.  There has been interval appearance of bibasilar patchy
 airspace disease as well as a layering left effusion. Findings most likely
 reflect atelectasis given the relatively rapid interval change, although
 pneumonia should also be considered.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in
 patient positioning.
