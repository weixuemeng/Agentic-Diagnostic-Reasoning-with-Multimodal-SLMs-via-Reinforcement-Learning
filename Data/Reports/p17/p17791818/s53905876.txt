 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:21 PM
  Reportedly, the patient was taken to the operating room earlier today and is
  now status post extubation (had been intubated for approximately 1 hr).  A
  small left pleural effusion is increased in size compared to the most recent
  radiograph from ___.  A small right pleural effusion is not
  significantly changed.  Increased consolidative opacities at the left lung
  base could be compressive atelectasis, although aspiration pneumonitis or
  developing infection cannot be excluded.  There is a minimal right lower lung
  dependent atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
  ___ by Dr. ___ at 19:18 via telephone on the day of the study.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with elevated white blood
 cell.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.  Heart size
 and mediastinum are stable with no substantial change in bilateral, most
 likely large pleural effusion.  The major change since the prior study is
 interval development of vascular engorgement.  Bibasal atelectasis and pleural
 effusion might potentially obscure pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Apical calcified pleural plaques are demonstrated, unchanged.
