 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant pain, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a subtle
 ill-defined opacity in the right lung base which could in the correct setting
 represent a very early pneumonia.  Right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Patient is
 rotated which limits evaluation.  Heart size is top normal.  No large
 effusions are seen.  Mediastinal contour is normal.  Bony structures are
 intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity at the right lung base which in the correct
 clinical setting could represent a very early/mild pneumonia.
