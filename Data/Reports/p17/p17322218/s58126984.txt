                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with cough, assess for infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged and there is no pulmonary vascular
 engorgement, edema, or pleural effusion to raise concern for cardiac
 decompensation.  Lateral view suggests at least a moderate degree of
 calcification in the aortic valve, but this need not be pathologic in a
 patient of this age.
 
 A 9 mm wide elliptical opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the
 right fifth rib could be a small skin growth, benign sclerosis in the rib, or
 alternatively a lung nodule.  However, given the patient's advanced age and
 the presence of a similar-appearing lesion in the left axilla, the finding may
 well not warrant further imaging for purposes of clarification.  Lateral view
 shows mild peribronchial opacification and volume loss at one of the lung
 bases, probably the residual of basal pneumonia that was present on ___ but has otherwise cleared.
