                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, assess for possible cause.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP view of the chest was provided.  Lung volumes
 are low.  There are bibasilar mild opacities which could represent
 atelectasis.  The heart appears top normal.  No definite sign of pneumonia,
 though the lower lungs are suboptimally assessed.  Mediastinal contour is
 stable with atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob.  Bony
 structures are intact.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal assessment of the lower lungs due to low lung volumes
 with probable atelectasis, less likely pneumonia causing obscuration at this
 level. Mild cardiomegaly.
