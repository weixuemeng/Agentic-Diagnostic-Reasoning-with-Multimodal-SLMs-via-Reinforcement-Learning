 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung volumes are lower, particularly at the base of the left lung, making it
 difficult to assess subtle changes.  The residual metastases in the left lower
 lobe following remission after treatment are stable as are larger cavitated
 lesions in the right upper lobe and at the right lung base.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or good evidence of pneumonia. 
 Heart size is normal.  Right subclavian infusion port ends in the region of
 the superior cavoatrial junction.
