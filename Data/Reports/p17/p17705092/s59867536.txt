                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma,
 presenting with fevers and cough.  Evaluate for new pulmonary infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Ill-defined bilateral opacities, most
 prominent in the left lower lobe and right apex are compatible with the known
 consolidations seen in recent chest CT.  No new dominant consolidation is
 identified.  No cardiomegaly is present.  Right hilar prominence is due to
 known large hilar nodal mass, well characterized in prior CT.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath catheter ends in the lower SVC, unchanged in position from prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Compared with prior CT and allowing for difference in techniques
 there is no new dominant pulmonary consolidation.  Scattered ill-defined
 nodular opacities are compatible with known lung metastasis.
