                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with known lower extremity squamous cell
 carcinoma, now with pulmonary infiltrates.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portal view of the chest with the patient in upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___, and a
 CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior examination, there has been no significant
 interval change other than decreased lung volumes.  Diffuse, irregular,
 noncavitating, bilateral lung nodules are again seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or frank pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse, bilateral pulmonary nodules, which in a patient with
 known squamous cell carcinoma, may represent metaastatic disease.
