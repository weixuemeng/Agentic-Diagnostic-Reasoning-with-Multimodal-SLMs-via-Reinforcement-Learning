                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, known mediastinal metastases.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT.  ___ chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium.  Diffuse
 parenchymal opacities have progressed when compared to the previous
 radiograph.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size
 and hilar contours are difficult to assess given the extensive parenchymal
 opacities.  Mediastinal contour appears unchanged.  Known metastatic lesion
 within the T11 vertebra is better demonstrated on the previous CT.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening opacities diffusely within the lungs.  While a component of this is
 due to metastatic disease, given the rapid interval progression, superimposed
 infection is suspected, particularly within the left lung base.
