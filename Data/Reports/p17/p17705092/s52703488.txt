                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Squamous cell carcinoma.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Multifocal parenchymal opacities
 reflecting metastatic disease are worse compared to ___,
 particularly at the lung bases.  While this is likely disease progression, a
 superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  If clarification is
 needed, a CT chest could be performed.
 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The known T11 metastatic focus
 is not appreciated by this modality, however, irregularity of the sternum is
 consistent with known osseous metastatic disease.  Contrast within the renal
 collecting systems remains from the recent head CT with contrast.  A right
 subclavian MediPort terminates in the right atrium.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 16:58 on ___ by telephone ___ minutes after discovery.
