  Multifocal rounded opacities.  No definite hilar lymphadenopathy.  No pleural
  effusion or pneumothorax.  Given the absence of fever and decreased clinical
  concern of infection, this could reflect septic emboli, vasculitis or
  rheumatoid nodules.  Metastatic disease is also a consideration. 
  Cross-sectional imaging could further evaluate.  Findings discussed with Dr.
  ___ by Dr. ___ at 09:12 on ___ by telephone at the time of

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a cough.  Suspect pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest read in conjunction with the chest CT
 performed on ___, but available at the time of this review.  I also
 have benefit of additional clinical information which states that the patient
 does not manifest infection.
 
 In addition to dozens of lung nodules, most irregular and none clearly
 cavitated, ranging up to 18 mm in diameter, the chest CT scan on ___
 shows symmetric central adenopathy.  Most likely diagnosis, if the patient is
 entirely asymptomatic, is sarcoidosis, particularly if the patient is ___
 ___.  Alternative diagnoses are vasculitis (Churg-___), lymphoma, and
 a non-pyogenic infection due to fungus.
 
 Heart size is normal, and there is no pleural effusion.
