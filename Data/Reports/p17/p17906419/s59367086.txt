 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:49 PM
  Haze over the entire left lung field with density tracking to the left apex,
  likely representing pleural fluid. Left lower lobe collapse. Endotracheal tube
  in standard position with additional small catheter coursing into the left
  mainstem bronchus, likely corresponding to the left bronchial occlusion
  device. New right hilar clips. Interval removal of left subclavian catheter.
  Discussed with ___ by phone at 8:47 p.m. on ___ at time of
  discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:50 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with renal cell carcinoma after right
 nephrectomy.  Multiple metastases.  Left lower lobe electrocautery for
 bronchial obstruction, complicated by severe bleeding, now with balloon
 tamponade and bronchial blocker.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest read in conjunction with torso CT on ___, most
 recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Left lower lobe is collapsed, and there is at least a moderate left pleural
 effusion.  There could be consolidation in the left upper lung.  Lateral view
 would be very helpful in separating pleura from pulmonary abnormalities.
 
 Bronchial blocker traversing a standard placed endotracheal tube ends in the
 left main bronchus, no less than 3.3 cm from the carina.  The right lung is
 largely clear.  There may be a small region of consolidation at the right lung
 base medially.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.  Contour of
 the mediastinal along the aortic arch and left heart border is straightened,
 probably by central adenopathy.
