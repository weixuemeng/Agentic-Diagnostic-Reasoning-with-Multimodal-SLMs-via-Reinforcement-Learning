                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female metastatic cancer to the lungs.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso with contrast from ___. Chest radiograph from
 ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral chest radiographs were provided. Lung volumes are low. Left
 upper and lower lobe opacities have increased since the prior radiograph and
 likely represent worsening disease.  Again seen is the partial collapse of the
 left lower lobe.  There is no pneumothorax.    The cardiac silhouette is not
 enlarged.  Clips are seen in the right lower lung field and in the midline of
 the abdomen.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  The bones are
 intact except for degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsening left lung opacities. Recommend correlation with CT.
