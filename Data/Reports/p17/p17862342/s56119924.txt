                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fluid about the spine.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The heart size is mildly enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance, unchanged.  The aortic knob is calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 likely present.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present.  Compression
 deformity at the thoracolumbar junction is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.
