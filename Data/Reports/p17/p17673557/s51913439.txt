                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p fall please r/o fx  // fx?      Additional
 history:  Esophageal perforation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT from outside hospital from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An interstitial abnormality, most pronounced in the left midlung zone
 suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease.  Clips are present
 overlying the left scapula. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for
 calcifications of the aortic knob and a dilated ascending aorta.  A small
 pneumomediastinum, present on a Chest CT ___ is not visible on today's
 study; if still present, it has not enlarged.There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 Vascular clips denote prior left axillary surgery and the configuration of the
 soft tissues of the chest wall suggest prior mastectomy. Although no fracture
 is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sensitive for detection of
 chest cage trauma. Regions where there are focal findings of possible trauma
 should be clearly marked and imaged with bone detail views.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process. Findings suggestive of chronic interstitial
 lung disease.
