 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Mild overinflation, as reflected by flattened hemidiaphragms on the
 lateral projection.
 
 The lung volumes have slightly decreased since the previous examination,
 likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is at the upper range of normal, but there is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumonia.  Unchanged and known small apical calcified
 granulomas.
