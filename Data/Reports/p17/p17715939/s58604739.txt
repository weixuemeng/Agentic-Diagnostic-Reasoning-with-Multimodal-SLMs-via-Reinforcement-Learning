                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of alcohol abuse, now intubated for acute respiratory
 distress.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ to ___.
 
 SEMIUPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  There is a new large right
 pneumothorax which was not present on the prior examination.  There is no
 mediastinal shift or flattening of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm to suggest
 tension.  The right lower lobe opacity present on the prior study is now more
 apparent likely due to compressive atelectasis from the pneumothorax.  Left
 lung is clear.  The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is
 no pleural effusion.  The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in
 appropriate and unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New large right pneumothorax with no evidence of tension.
 2.  Pneumonia or atelectasis at the right lung base.
 
 Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ ___ telephone on ___ at 10:57 a.m.
