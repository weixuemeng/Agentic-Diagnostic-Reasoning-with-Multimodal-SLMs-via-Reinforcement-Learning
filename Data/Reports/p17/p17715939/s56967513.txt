                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and EVD placement, now
 finished 10 days of antibiotics and white count is increasing, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  One portable AP view of the chest.  Subtle right lower lobe opacity
 may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia.  The subdiaphragmatic free air
 is decreased and a small amount is still present.  Left basilar atelectasis. 
 The right PICC line ends in the mid SVC.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe likely represents atelectasis;
 however, may represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
 
 2.  Mild left basilar atelectasis.
