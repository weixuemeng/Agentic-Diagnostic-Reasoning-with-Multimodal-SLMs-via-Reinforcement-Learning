                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  portable upright radiograph of chest was reviewed in comparison
 with prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Focal peribronchial opacities in the medial portion of right lower
 lung is concerning for aspiration given the clinical history.  Patient is
 rotated limiting assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, however,
 overall remains unchanged since prior studies.  No pleural effusion.  OGT is
 seen to course below the diaphragm; however, the side port ends 3 cm below the
 GE junction.  Consider advancing the orogastric tube by another 4-5 cm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Focal peribronchial opacities in the medial portion of right lower lung is
 likely aspiration.
 
 2.  Side port of orogastric tube ends 3 cmt below the GE junction.  Consider
 advancing orogastric tube by another 4-5 cm for a better seating.
