                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Ventriculo-pleural shunt with headache, question position
 of the shunt catheter.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Catheter extends
 over the anterior chest wall and is directed posteriorly, projecting over the
 left lower lung, likely terminating in the left pleural space as seen on prior
 CT from ___.  There is a trace left pleural effusion, likely related to
 the ventriculopleural shunt.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.  Bony structures are intact. 
 Clips in the right upper quadrant are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Ventriculopleural shunt appears in unchanged position.  Small
 left effusion is likely related to shunt.
