 Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.  There is

 mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Descending aorta appears tortuous with
 aortic arch calcifications.  Heart size is top normal.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.  Aortic valvular calcifications are again noted.  Calcifications of the
 intraabdominal descending aorta are also seen.  Otherwise, partially imaged
 upper abdomen appears unremarkable.
