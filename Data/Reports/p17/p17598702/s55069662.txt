                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough, subjective fevers
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with dense mitral annular
 calcifications.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac
 region.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Mild degenerative
 changes are noted in the lower thoracic spine.  Vascular stent is seen within
 the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis though infection
 cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
