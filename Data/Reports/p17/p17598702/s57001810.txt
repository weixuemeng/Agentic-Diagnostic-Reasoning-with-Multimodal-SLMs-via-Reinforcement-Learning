                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest again demonstrate moderate
 cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement.  The lungs appear better aerated on
 this study with persistent central venous vascular congestion and no overt
 evidence for pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is no focal air space consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Dense mitral
 annular calcifications are again seen. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate cardiomegaly with no acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
