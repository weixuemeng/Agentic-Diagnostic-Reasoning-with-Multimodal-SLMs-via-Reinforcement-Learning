                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p LV mass removal  // eval for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, multifocal airspace opacities have
 rapidly developed throughout the right lung with relative sparing of the right
 apex.  Multifocal aspiration and rapidly evolving pneumonia should be
 considered.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening nonspecific opacity in
 the left retrocardiac region and increase in size of a moderate right pleural
 effusion.
