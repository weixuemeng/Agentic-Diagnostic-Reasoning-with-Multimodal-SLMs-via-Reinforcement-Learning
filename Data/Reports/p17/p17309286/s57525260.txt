 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with gastric outlet obstruction, intubated for
 EGD  // evaluate ETT placement and for any acute pulmonary conditions
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now intubated. The tip
 of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 3 cm above the carinal. The
 nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. Minimal left pleural effusion
 obscures the left costophrenic sinus.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis has
 developed. The lung volumes are overall low.  No pneumothorax. Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
