                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region is new compared to
 the prior radiograph, and projects over the lower thoracic spine on the
 lateral view.  Lungs are otherwise clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar opacity, which may reflect focal
 atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be
 helpful in this regard.
