 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Myeloma, PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the line inserted over the
 left upper extremity has been moved forward.  The frontal and the lateral
 radiograph show that the line is slightly coiled at the level of the lower
 right atrium.  To ensure safe position within the superior vena cava, the line
 should be pulled back by approximately 6 cm.  No complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
