                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old, febrile and neutropenia, evaluate for pulmonary
 process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line appears to have its tip in the proximal right
 atrium due to differences in inspiration between studies.  There has been
 reduction in overall lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. 
 However, as the interstitium appears indistinct, this likely reflects interval
 development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There are likely small
 layering effusions, right greater than left.  No pneumothorax.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in
 inspiration and lordotic technique.
