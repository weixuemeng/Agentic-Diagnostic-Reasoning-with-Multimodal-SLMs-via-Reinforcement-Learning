                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with a history of 2-vessel CABG in ___ was transferred
 from___ for hypotension and anemia and admitted to the MICU,
 where she had a massive GI bleed and complications of sepsis and hypoxia
 secondary to diffuse lung disease. She is now stable with an oxygen
 requirement.  // resolution of pleural effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs of ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits in this patient status
 post previous median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery. Widespread
 calcified pulmonary nodules are present, most miliary in size, but a dominant
 calcified right upper lobe nodule measures 8 mm.  Lungs are otherwise clear
 except for linear atelectasis at the right base and minimal patchy left
 retrocardiac opacification.  Interval resolution of pulmonary edema, and
 basilar predominant airspace opacities and pleural effusions since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Resolution of acute pulmonary and pleural abnormalities present on ___ chest radiograph with minimal residual left retrocardiac
 opacities and a small focus of linear right basilar atelectasis.
 
 2.  Widespread calcified pulmonary nodules are suggestive of previous
 granulomatous infection or healed varicella.
