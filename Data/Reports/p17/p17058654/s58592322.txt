                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/GI bleed, unclear miliary pattern, intubated  // Evaluate
 for interval change in pulmonary edema after aggressive diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous image, there is minimally improved transparency of
 the right basal lung, potentially reflecting improved ventilation of this lung
 area. Otherwise, the diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, associated with
 small pleural effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis, are constant in extent
 and severity.  No new opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
