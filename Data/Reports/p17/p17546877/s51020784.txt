                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polytrauma from pedestrian versus car, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.
 
 Note is made of an asymmetry of the positions of both scapulae, with linear
 lucency through the scapula on the right suggestive of fracture.  The
 possibility of some occult right-sided rib fractures is difficult to exclude.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Heart size is borderline enlarged. There
 is prominence of the right mediastinum, not clearly accounted for by low
 inspiratory volumes.  Probable vascular plethora.  Possible small amount of
 pleural fluid on the right.  There is band-like atelectasis at the left lung
 base.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Surgical clips overlie the superior mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Likely right scapular fracture.  Occult rib fractures may also be present.
 
 2.  Low inspiratory volumes.  Possible prominence of the right superior
 mediastinum - in this setting, the possibility of mediastinal hematoma would
 be difficult to exclude.
 
 3.  Probable increased interstitial markings, albeit likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  Small right effusion may be present.
