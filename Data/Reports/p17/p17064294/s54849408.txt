                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with clonidine overdose.  Question ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube extending
 2.9 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube traverses inferiorly out of view. 
 The cardiac silhouette is prominent, accentuated by AP technique and low lung
 volume.  There is a perihilar fullness likely representing mild congestion
 related to resuscitation.  There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Lines and tubes appropriate in position.
 2. Mild central vascular congestion, may be secondary to resuscitation.
