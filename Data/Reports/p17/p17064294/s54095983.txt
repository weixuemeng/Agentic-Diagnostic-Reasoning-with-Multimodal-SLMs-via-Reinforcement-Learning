 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 338
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 A semi-upright portable chest film ___ at 4 a.m. is submitted and
 compared to the prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 2.5 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled
 within the stomach.  Lung volumes remain relatively low with patchy opacity at
 the right base likely reflecting atelectasis.  Aspiration or pneumonia would
 be less likely.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  No pleural
 effusions.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable and within normal
 limits given portable technique.
