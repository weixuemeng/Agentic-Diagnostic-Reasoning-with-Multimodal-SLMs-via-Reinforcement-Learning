                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left chest pain, here to evaluate for left rib fracture.  
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate clear lungs without focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardio mediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.  No acute, displaced rib
 fractures are detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute displaced rib fracture is detected.  If there is clinical concern, a
 dedicated left rib series is recommended with a BB placed over the site of the
 patient's pain.
