                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Biapical linear and nodular opacities are present, with adjacent
 relatively symmetrical biapical thickening and mild associated upper lobe
 volume loss.  Lungs are otherwise clear except for focal linear scar or
 atelectasis at the left base.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal, and there are no pleural effusions.  Mild scoliosis is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Biapical opacities are probably the sequela of previous
 granulomatous infection, but activity of disease is difficult to determine
 without older radiographs for comparison.  In their absence, short-term
 followup chest x-ray in ___ weeks may be helpful to document stability and to
 exclude an active process in this region.
