                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe asthma with worsening shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A linear opacity at the left base is similar to the prior exam. 
 Given the chronicity, this is likely chronic atelectasis or scarring.  There
 is no new opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process, specifically, no evidence of
 pneumonia.
