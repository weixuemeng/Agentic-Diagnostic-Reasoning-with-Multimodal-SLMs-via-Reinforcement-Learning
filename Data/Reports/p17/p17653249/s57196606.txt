                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post-NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph available from ___ at 8:24 p.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 The endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian
 CVL terminating at the upper SVC is unchanged in position.  There is a new
 orogastric tube coiled within the stomach, which is now less distended.  A
 left thoracostomy tube is unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.  The lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular
 crowding.  Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, slightly worse on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina.
 2.  Orogastric tube coiled within the stomach.
 3.  Increased left basilar atelectasis.
 
 The findings were made by Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:01 a.m.  The ET tube
