                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 22:04, chest
 radiograph from ___ and CT abdomen/pelvis from ___ at 2:06
 am.  
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Lung volumes are low.  There is pulmonary
 vascular congestion and hilar enlargement suggestive of volume overload. 
 Additionally, there is opacification of the left lung base, which correlates
 with atelectasis and a moderate effusion seen on concurrent CT abdomen/pelvis.
 Asymmetric radial opacities originating from the left hilus may be due to
 lymphatic engorgement due to congestion.  However, consider repeat radiograph
 after diuresis/drainage to ensure resolution.  If finding persists, CT is
 warranted to exclude underlying mass.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to recent prior.
 
 2.  Moderate left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis
 
 3.  Left hilar fullness likely due to lymphatic engorgement from congestion. 
 If finding persists, chest CT is recommended.
