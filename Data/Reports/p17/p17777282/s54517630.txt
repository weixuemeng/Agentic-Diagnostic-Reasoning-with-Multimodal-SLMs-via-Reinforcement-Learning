                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with airway stent, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Single portable upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a left mainstem bronchial stent which appears to be
 in satisfactory position.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary known metastatic
 lesions with a more dominant mass in the left upper lobe appear unchanged. 
 However, there has been interval appearance of perihilar fullness and
 indistinct interstitium suggesting superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous.  A
 linear lucency projecting in the left superior mediastinum, is felt to most
 likely correspond to the border of the trachea given marked patient rotation,
 although trace pneumomediastinum cannot be entirely excluded.  This can be
 further assessed on followup imaging.  Heart remains upper limits of normal
 size.
