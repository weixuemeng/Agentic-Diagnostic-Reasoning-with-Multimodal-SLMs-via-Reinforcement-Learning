                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Lung volumes
 are low but the lungs are clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  Bilateral hilar nodes are enlarged since ___, as
 seen on the same-day CT abdomen.  The left bronchus appears narrowed.  The
 thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous.  The heart size and cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes.  Narrowing of the left
 bronchus may be due to mass effect.  As recommended on the same-day abdominal
 CT, chest CT may be obtained for further evaluation.
