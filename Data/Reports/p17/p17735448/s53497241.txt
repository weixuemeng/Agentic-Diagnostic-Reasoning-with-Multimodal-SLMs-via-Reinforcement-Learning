                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Asthma, shortness of breath and cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The heart size is top normal with a left ventricular
 predominance.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot
 be excluded.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis but infection
 cannot be excluded.  Repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory
 effort is recommended to better assess the lung bases.
