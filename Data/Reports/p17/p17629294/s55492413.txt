                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery, postoperative baseline.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices have been removed.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with atelectatic changes bilaterally.  There is some hazy opacification at the
 left base with the pulmonary markings intact.  However, on the lateral view,
 there is no definite evidence of pleural fluid.  Some of this appearance could
 reflect soft tissue in a patient with a very lordotic position.
 
 A repeat study with encouragement of better inspiration and a clearer lateral
 view would be helpful for further evaluation.
