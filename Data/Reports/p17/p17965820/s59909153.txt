 AP CHEST, 3:14 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with a fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large fluid collection has developed in the left hemithorax despite the
 presence of a left pleural tube.  This is an indication that the fluid and
 chest tube are not in communication, either because the chest tube is fissural
 or the fluid collection is extrapleural.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged to discuss these findings at the time of this dictation.
 
 Right lower lobe has collapsed, small right pleural effusion is new and there
 is probably mild edema in the right lung.  The patient has a very large hiatus
 hernia, which may contain more than the stomach.
 
 Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
