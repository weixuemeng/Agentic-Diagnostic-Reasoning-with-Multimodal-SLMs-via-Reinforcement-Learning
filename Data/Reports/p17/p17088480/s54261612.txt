                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Under treatment for breast cancer with ground-glass opacities in
 both lungs.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is some increased bilateral
 pulmonary opacifications, which most likely reflect increasing pulmonary
 edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
