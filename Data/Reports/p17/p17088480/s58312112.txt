                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post fall with tachycardia.  Evaluate for fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, two views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiopulmonary
 vasculature.  There are increased reticular markings, particularly at the lung
 bases suggestive of edema or aspiration.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 No definite fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increased reticulation particularly at the bases likely representing
 edema.  A component of aspiration is less likely.
 2.  No definite fracture.  If needed, a dedicated rib series may be performed
 to further assess.
