 HISTORY:  Delirium.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 Previously noted widespread patchy opacities have markedly improved and are
 nearly resolved.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There are mild multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Near-complete resolution of previously noted diffuse parenchymal opacities. 
 No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
