                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, SOB.  // evaluate for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The
 bilateral parenchymal opacities, projecting over the spine on the lateral
 chest x-ray, are constant in appearance. The lack of change since the previous
 examination suggests the presence of either an infectious or a fibrotic
 change.  Unchanged severe scoliosis. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary
 edema. No pleural effusion.  The fixation devices on the spine are constant.
