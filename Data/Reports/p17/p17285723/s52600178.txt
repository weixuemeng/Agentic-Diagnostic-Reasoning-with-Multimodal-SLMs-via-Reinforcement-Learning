                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate posterior fixation hardware
 in the lower thoracic/lumbar spine, unchanged. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. Increased opacities seen projecting over the lower
 thoracic spine, concerning for consolidation.  No definite correlate is seen
 on the frontal view, although there is perhaps slightly increased opacity in
 the right lower lung.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacity projecting over the lower thoracic spine on lateral view,
 which could represent early basilar pneumonia or aspiration.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard
