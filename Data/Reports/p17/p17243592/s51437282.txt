                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP upright portable views of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dual-lead left-sided AICD is again seen, unchanged in position,
 with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium, right
 ventricle, and coronary sinus.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
 There is prominence of the central vasculature and perihilar haziness
 consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  There is persistent slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle, which could be due to pleural
 thickening/scarring versus trace pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.  Slight blunting of
 the right costophrenic angle could be due to a small pleural effusion versus
 chronic pleural thickening/scarring.
