                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post RFA of right lower lung
 nodule and fiducial placement.  Study requested for reevaluation of
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, right
 apical pneumothorax remains essentially unchanged.  Air is now also seen in
 the right lower pleural space.  The extent of ground-glass opacity in the
 right lower lung has not significantly changed, likely representative of
 hemorrhage.  There is no mediastinal shift to suggest tension. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. A fiducial marker is again seen in
 the right lower lung. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right pneumothorax.
