                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right lower lobe nodule RFA and
 fiducial placement, in need of assessment for pneumothorax.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 lung volumes are low resulting in bibasilar atelectasis.  There has been
 interval placement of a fiducial in the right lower lung with surrounding
 ground-glass opacity representing hemorrhage.  A small apical pneumothorax is
 present on the right with the uppermost portion of the visualized right lung
 apex projecting just below the right third posterior rib.  There is no
 mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic flattening to suggest tension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  Findings
 were discussed with ___ by ___ over the phone at 16:00 on
 ___; a follow-up chest radiograph is pending.
