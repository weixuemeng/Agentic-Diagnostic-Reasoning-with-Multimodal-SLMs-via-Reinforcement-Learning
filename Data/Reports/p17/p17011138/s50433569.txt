                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hemorrhage  // eval for infiltrate/pneumonia
 eval for infiltrate/pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There is no definite focal pulmonary abnormality.  Right apex is obscured by
 the first rib and there is at least pleural parenchymal scarring there.  If
 there is clinical concern for active hemoptysis, I would recommend chest CT
 scanning.
 
 Right lung base is elevated and the apex is laterally displaced.  This is
 sometimes a finding of pleural effusion, but could also be due to the weekend
 diaphragm or subphrenic mass effect.  There is no left pleural abnormality. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
