                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with headache, lung CA  // Eval for intracranial bleed or
 large mass, CXR symptoms
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are relatively low with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular
 markings.  There is right basilar opacity which may also be due to atelectasis
 though there is somewhat of a nodular appearance.   There is no
 effusion.Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Right basilar opacity likely atelectasis, though there is somewhat nodular
 component.  This should be correlated with cross-sectional imaging, likely
 performed elsewhere given patient's history of lung cancer.  No evidence of
 consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.
