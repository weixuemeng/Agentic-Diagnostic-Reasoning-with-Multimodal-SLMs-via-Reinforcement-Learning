                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The bronchovascular markings are accentuated due to underinflation
 of the lungs.  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected. 
 There is no large pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Allowing for low lung
 volumes, the cardiac silhouette is likely top normal in size.  The mediastinal
 contours are prominent due in part to low lung volumes and unfolding of the
 thoracic aorta.  The trachea is mildly deviated to the right by the aortic
 knob.  The visualized upper abdomen is relatively gasless with a density
 projecting over the left upper quadrant, which is of uncertain etiology. 
 Deformity of several right lateral ribs likely represents old healed rib
 fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes without focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia.
