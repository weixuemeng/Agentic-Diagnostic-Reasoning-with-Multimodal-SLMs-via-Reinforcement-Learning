                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with syncope
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. Chain
 sutures are seen along the right hilum and right suprahilar region compatible
 with prior lobectomy. Hilar contours are normal, and no pulmonary vascular
 congestion is seen.  Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacity within the left lung
 base may reflect atelectasis.  Right-sided pleural thickening with patchy
 opacity in the right lung base appears relatively similar, perhaps scarring or
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is been
 resection of the right fifth rib.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postsurgical changes in the right chest from prior lobectomy. Similar
 appearance of right lateral pleural thickening with patchy bibasilar
 opacities, possibly atelectasis and/or scarring.  Infection in the left lung
 base cannot be completely excluded.
