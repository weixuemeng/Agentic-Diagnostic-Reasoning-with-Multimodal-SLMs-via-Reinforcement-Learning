                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with L frontal IPH going to surg on ___
 for L crani and biopsy  // r/o pna Surg: ___ (crani and biopsy)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest CT and portable chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes and portable technique severely limits assessment of the lung
 parenchyma. Known left anterior chest wall mass with rib destruction is seen
 to better detail on recent CT of ___. Nonspecific linear left
 basilar opacity probably represents atelectasis in this setting. Remainder of
 visualized lungs are grossly clear and have been more fully evaluated by a
 recent chest CT. Postoperative changes are noted in the left chest wall and
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Technically limited exam due to low lung volumes demonstrating no acute lung
 abnormality. Known left anterior chest wall mass has been more fully evaluated
 by recent chest CT
