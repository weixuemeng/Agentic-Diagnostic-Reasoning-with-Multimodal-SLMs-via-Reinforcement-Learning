 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ Y/O M s/p L4-___ fx and L CT, removed ___  // interval
 change from post-pull film this AM, ? increase in PTX or pleural effusion-
 Please obtain film at 13:00.     interval change from post-pull film this AM,
 ? increase in P
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is probably little
 change in the tiny left apical pneumothorax as well as the possible loculated
 pneumothorax at the left base.  Subcutaneous gas is again along the lower
 chest wall and upper abdomen.  Fixation device is again seen about previous
 left clavicle fracture.
 There is the vague suggestion of some asymmetric opacification in the right
 mid zone.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a
 developing consolidation.
