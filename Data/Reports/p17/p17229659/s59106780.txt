                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with unwitnessed fall.  Tenderness to palpation in
 the left upper back.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  There is a small to moderate size hiatal hernia.  The
 aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation.  Streaky opacities in
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  Pulmonary vasculature is not
 engorged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.  Clips are noted in the
 upper abdomen on the lateral view.  Fractures of the left fourth, fifth,
 sixth, seventh and eighth posterior rib fractures appear acute.  Multiple
 remote bilateral posterior rib fractures are also present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Several acute appearing left posterior rib fractures involving ribs 4, 5, 6, 7
 and 8.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
