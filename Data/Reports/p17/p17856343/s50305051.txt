                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lateral views are limited due to soft tissue attenuation.  The
 heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. 
 Chin flexion obscures the upper portion of the mediastinum.  There is no
 definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although visualization of the left
 lung base is limited due to soft tissue attenuation.  Within the limitations
 of technique, there is no definite abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination, but no definite evidence of acute
 cardiopulmonary disease.
