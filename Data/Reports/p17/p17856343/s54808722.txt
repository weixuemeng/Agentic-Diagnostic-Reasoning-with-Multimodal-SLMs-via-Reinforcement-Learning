                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right PICC placed but difficulty visualizing on portable.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:46 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Due to poor beam penetration and patient's body habitus, the PICC
 catheter is not well visualized on either PA or standard lateral views.  Of
 note, the catheter is partially visualized on a partial lateral view which
 excludes the distal tip of the catheter; however, the catheter is at least to
 the level of the mid right atrium.
 
 There is otherwise no short-term interval change compared to exam from two
 hours prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Non-visualization of the catheter tip due to body habitus and
 technique on standard views; however, the catheter is located at least to the
 level of the mid right atrium on partial lateral view.  Recommend withdrawal
 of the catheter by 5 cm with a repeat radiograph.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with ___ at 1:51 p.m.
 and ___ at 2:39 p.m. by ___ on ___ at time of
