                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, only the proximal part of
 the nasogastric tube (the one outside of the patient's) is seen on the image. 
 No nasogastric tube is seen projecting over the lower neck or the esophagus. 
 This strongly suggests, that the nasogastric tube is coiled in the oral cavity
 (which is supported by the information given by the patient).
 
 The tube needs to be repositioned.
 
 The ventilation of the lung bases on both the right and the left are
 essentially improved.  Unchanged cardiomegaly.  Unchanged alignment of sternal
 wires.
