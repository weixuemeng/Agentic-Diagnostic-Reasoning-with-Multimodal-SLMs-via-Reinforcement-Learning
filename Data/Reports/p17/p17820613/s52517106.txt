                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Trauma patient status post chest tube placement.  Evaluate chest
 tube positioning.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ at 06:28 back
 to ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  Since the prior film, a left chest
 tube has been inserted.  The side port is possibly within the chest wall. 
 There is reduction in the left pleural effusion with a moderate amount still
 remaining.  The degree of rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged from the
 prior radiograph.  There is a hint of radiolucency around the left mediastinal
 border suggesting some degree of pneumothorax as well.  There are multiple rib
 fractures of the left posterior third through seventh ribs.  The fifth and
 sixth rib fractures are floating.  There is likely a small right effusion, but
 the right lung is clear and appears better aerated.
