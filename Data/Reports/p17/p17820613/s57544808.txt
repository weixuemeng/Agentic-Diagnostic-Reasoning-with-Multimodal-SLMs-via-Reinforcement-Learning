                                 FINAL REPORT
 TECHNIQUE:  A single erect portable radiograph of chest was compared with
 prior radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Multiple left rib fractures are present.  Since ___,
 bilateral, minimal pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis, left side more
 than right, have worsened.  Prominent pulmonary vasculature, fullness of
 azygos vein and mildly widened mediastinal contour suggests pulmonary vascular
 and mediastinal congestion.  Top normal heart size is unchanged.  Tip of
 epidural catheter ends at D4/D5 vertebral level.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Since ___, bilateral mild pleural effusions and bibasal
 atelectasis, left side more than right, have  worsened.
 
 2.  Pulmonary vascular and mediastinal congestion; however, no frank evidence
 of pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Multiple left rib fractures.
