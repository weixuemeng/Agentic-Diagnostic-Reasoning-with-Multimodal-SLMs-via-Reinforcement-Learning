                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed.  Little change in the small apical pneumothorax on the left. 
 Continued opacification at the left base, presumably representing loculated
 effusion and adjacent atelectasis, in a patient with multiple contiguous left
 segmental rib fractures, concerning for flail chest.
