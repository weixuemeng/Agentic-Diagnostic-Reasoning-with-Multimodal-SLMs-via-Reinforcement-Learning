 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): ___ ___ 6:34 AM
  INDICATION:  Status post fall, evaluate for pneumothorax.
  
  COMPARISON:  None.
  
  FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary
  vasculature and exaggeration of the heart size.  There is minimal bibasilar
  atelectasis as well as a retrocardiac heterogeneous opacity which could also
  be atelectasis or pneumonia.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart size
  is top normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There may be a small
  left pleural effusion.  No right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
  
  IMPRESSION:
  1.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis with possible left retrocardiac
