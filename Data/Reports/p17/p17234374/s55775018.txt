                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with seizure, rule out infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable.  The hila are unremarkable,
 although the right hilum is suboptimally assessed.  The right suprahilar mass
 is grossly stable in appearance.  Right lung volume loss is unchanged.  Left
 lower lung airspace opacity is only appreciated on frontal projection, and
 appears new since prior exams.  No correlate is identified on lateral view. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Equivocal left lower lobe opacity could reflect pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
 2. Stable right suprahilar mass with right lung volume loss.
