                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with R sided lung adenoca s/p radiation, chemo now w/
 presyncopal event
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Redemonstrated is a large right upper lobe paramedian
 mass, better evaluated on prior CT.  Linear airspace opacities adjacent to the
 right hilum is unchanged over multiple prior CTs and likely represents
 scarring.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear without lobar consolidation,
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
