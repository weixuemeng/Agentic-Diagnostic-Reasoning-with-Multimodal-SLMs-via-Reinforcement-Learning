 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices remain in standard position.  There is continued increase
 in opacification at the left base, consistent with worsening aspiration or
 infectious pneumonia.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect
 some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
