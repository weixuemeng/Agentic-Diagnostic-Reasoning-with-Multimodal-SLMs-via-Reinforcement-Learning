                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cholelithiasis and cholangitis status post ERCP and open
 cholecystectomy complicated by colonic perforation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable, AP view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior day, a left internal jugular central venous
 catheter again terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  An
 opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax may represent an artifact,
 noting that it was not present on very recent prior radigraphs from ___.  There are moderate layering pleural effusions and basilar opacities
 which are not specific, although most often would be associated with
 atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.  Findings are similar to the prior
 examination, allowing for differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent basilar opacities and pleural effusions.  Differential
 considerations include aspiration, although findings are not definitely
 changed, versus atelectasis or pneumonia.
