                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with aspiration, perforated colon and
 sepsis, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 3:47.
 
 Portable semi-supine chest film ___ at 4 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left internal jugular central
 line are unchanged in position.  There is interval worsening bilateral
 layering pleural effusions with increasing airspace consolidation particularly
 at the left base which likely reflects lower lobe atelectasis.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  In addition, the pulmonary vasculature is more
 ill-defined suggesting a component of superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Despite marked patient rotation to the left, the heart remains stably
 enlarged with a left ventricular prominence which likely reflects
 cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 large pneumothorax is seen, although sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 somewhat diminished given the semi-supine technique.
