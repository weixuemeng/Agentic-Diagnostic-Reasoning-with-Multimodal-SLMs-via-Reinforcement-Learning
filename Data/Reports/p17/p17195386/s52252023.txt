  Large amount of free intra-abdominal air is more than expected 3 days
  postoperatively.  In discussion with Dr. ___ at 18:05 on ___ by
  telephone, there is no concern at this time for visceral perforation.  The
  lung volumes are extremely low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular
  structures.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is huge amount of
 intraperitoneal gas.  This presumably is related to the recent surgery, since
 there is no evidence clinically of visceral perforation.
 
 Extremely low lung volumes with probably little change in the appearance of
 the heart and lungs.
