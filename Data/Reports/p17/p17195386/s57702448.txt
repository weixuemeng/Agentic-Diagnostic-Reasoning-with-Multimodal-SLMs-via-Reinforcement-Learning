 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right upper lobe opacities spanning 2.6 cm correlate to a cluster of nodules

 consolidations which are concerning for pneumonia at this time, although the
 cluster of nodules in the right upper lobe may be related to atypical
 infectious disease.  There may be a small right pleural effusion. The left
 pleural looks clear.  Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. No
 pneumothorax.
