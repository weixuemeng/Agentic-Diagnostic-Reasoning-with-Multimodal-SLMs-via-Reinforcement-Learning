                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with intubation  // tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates in standard position, approximately 4.4 cm from
 the carina.  Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular
 engorgement. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam. There
 are no displaced fractures identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube in standard position. Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.
