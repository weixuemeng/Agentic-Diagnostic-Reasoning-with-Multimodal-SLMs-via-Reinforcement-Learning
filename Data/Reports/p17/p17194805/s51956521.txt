                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fatigue, cough, hyponatremia  // pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are well-expanded. A 15 mm well-circumscribed nodular density is
 noted in the left lower lobe. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, focal consolidation,
 or pulmonary edema. Mild aortic arch calcifications are present. Multilevel
 degenerative changes are present throughout the thoracic spine, with disc
 space narrowing and anterior flowing osteophytes contiguous over multiple
 levels, compatible with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Well-circumscribed nodular density in the left lower lobe may represent a
 granuloma. Correlation with prior imaging is recommended to ensure stability.
 If no prior imaging is available for comparison, low kilovoltage oblique
 radiographs could be obtained to document uniform calcification, diagnostic of
 a benign nodule.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with
 Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:31 AM, after attending review.
