                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY DATED ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A new confluent opacity has developed in the right retrocardiac
 region, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm contour medially.  There
 is also a subtle new area of opacity at the left base.  Considering clinical
 concern for aspiration, these findings could represent acute aspiration event.
 Lungs are otherwise clear except for a questionable small 1-cm nodular opacity
 overlying the ninth left posterior rib level.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable allowing for slight patient rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New bibasilar opacities, which could be due to clinically suspected
 aspiration. Small nodular opacity in left lower lung, for which standard PA
 and lateral CXR is recommended for further evaluation prior to discharge.
