                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 1:36 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dementia and a known aspiration event. 
 Hypoxic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large area of new heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung
 zone is most likely pneumonia.  Lung volumes are lower in general today than
 previously, accounting for greater opacification at the right lung base,
 though I cannot exclude pneumonia in that location as well.  A very small
 right pleural effusion may be present.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is
 longstanding.
