                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chronic back pain, increasing fatigue, and
 leg swelling.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unremarkable.  The lungs are clear of consolidation but,
 within the limitations of the patient's body habitus, show subtle upper lobe
 bronchiectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate
 degenerative changes are seen in the bilateral glenohumeral as well as
 acromioclavicular joints.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or heart failure.
