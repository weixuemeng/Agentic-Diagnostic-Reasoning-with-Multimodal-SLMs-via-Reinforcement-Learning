                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Presyncope.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The aorta shows mild unfolding.  Patchy
 calcification is noted along the arch.  There is mild elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm probably due to mild volume loss at the left lung base and a
 prominent gastric bubble.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild
 leftward convex curvature is centered at the thoracolumbar junction.  The
 bones are probably demineralized to some degree.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting atelectasis at the left lung base, but no convincing
 evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
