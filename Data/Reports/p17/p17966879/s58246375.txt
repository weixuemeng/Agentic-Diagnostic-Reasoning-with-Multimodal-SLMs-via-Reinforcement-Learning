                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP view.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again noted is a large hiatal hernia.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Streaky opacifications in the left inferior hilar
 region were present before to some extent and can be expected as chronic
 atelectasis is often seen in association with a large hiatal hernia.  However,
 it appears more prominent than before and the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia could be considered.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on
 the left.  A very small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left basilar opacity.  The appearance and location are fairly
 typical for atelectasis that is usually seen in conjunction with a large
 hiatal hernia, although superimposed pneumonia is a possibility to consider.
