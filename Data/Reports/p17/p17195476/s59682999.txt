                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Known poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, recent admission
 nausea, vomiting, dullness to percussion at lung bases, decreased breath
 sounds.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An in-dwelling central line/catheter is in place -- the tip is not optimally
 visualized, but likely lies in the region of the SVC/RA junction.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, heart size is probably
 borderline, but not frankly enlarged.  Minimal patchy opacity at the right
 base is noted.  This likely represents atelectasis, rather than a focus of
 aspiration, but attention to this area on followup films could help to better
 characterize this.   Lungs are otherwise grossly clear, without CHF, focal
 infiltrate, or effusion.
