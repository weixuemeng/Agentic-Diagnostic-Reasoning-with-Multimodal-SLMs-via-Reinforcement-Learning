                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after motor vehicle accident with right rib
 fractures.  Is there pneumothorax?
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA inspiration and expiration and the lateral view, compared to
 ___:
 
 There may be a miniscule, clinically insignificant right apical pneumothorax
 elicited on the expiration view.  Small right pleural effusion or pleural
 thickening adjacent to anterolateral lower rib fractures is new or newly
 obvious.  More consolidation at both lung bases could be due to splinting,
 rather than aspiration or direct lung trauma.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Plate-like atelectasis at the left apex is clinically insignificant.
