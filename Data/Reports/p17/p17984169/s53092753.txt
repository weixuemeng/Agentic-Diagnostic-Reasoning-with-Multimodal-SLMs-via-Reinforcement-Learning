                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded and diffusely
 calcified.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Streaky bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  There is no focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. 
 Linear 1.8 cm radiopaque density projecting over the left upper abdomen may
 reflect ingested contents.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No focal consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.
