                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cholangitis  // please evaluate for acute
 cardiopulmonary process Surg: ___ (lap chole)
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___, low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac
 silhouette and result in crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Hazy
 increased opacity in the right lower hemi thorax could potentially be due to
 superimposition of soft tissue structures of the chest wall or may reflect a
 pleural effusion.  Standard PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful
 for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
