 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Patchy opacities are noted in the lung
 bases most likely reflective of atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  Clips are seen about the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Degenerative changes are noted involving the glenohumeral joints
 bilaterally with amorphous calcifications superolateral to the right humeral
 head suggestive of calcific tendinopathy.

 Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
