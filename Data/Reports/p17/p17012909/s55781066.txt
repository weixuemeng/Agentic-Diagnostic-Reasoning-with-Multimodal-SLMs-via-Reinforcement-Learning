                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after dual-chamber
 pacemaker placement.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The left-sided pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right
 atrium and right ventricle.  There is evidence of mild cardiomegaly.  No
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm is seen, chronicity
 undetermined.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No appreciable pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.
