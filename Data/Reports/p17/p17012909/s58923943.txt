                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough and shortness of breath.  // r/o
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is difficult to assess given
 obscuration of the right heart border due to a small to moderate size right
 pleural effusion.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is no pulmonary edema. Right
 basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis is present. No left-sided
 pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax is identified though
 assessment of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's chin
 projecting over this region. There are mild degenerative changes in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small to moderate right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis. 
 Pneumonia is difficult to exclude, however, within the right lung base.
