                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with hypoxia increase oxygen, history of lung cancer
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation.  Left-sided pacemaker
 device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the regions of the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Previously noted marked diffuse dilatation of the
 esophagus may be somewhat improved, but not fully assessed on this single
 view.  Marked enlargement of the right hilum as well as fullness of the right
 mediastinal contour reflects known lymphadenopathy, unchanged.  Mild to
 moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is noted with perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness.  Opacification within the right lung base is worse
 compared to the previous radiograph, concerning for collapse.  Known nodule
 within the right middle lobe is better assessed on the previous CT.  There is
 a moderate size right pleural effusion.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
 is chronic.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. Worsening opacification of the right lung base compared to the previous
 chest radiograph concerning for collapse though infection cannot be excluded. 
 Known right middle lobe nodule is not well assessed on this single view.
 3. Marked diffuse dilatation of the esophagus compatible with achalasia is not
 well assessed on the current exam.
 4. Moderate size right pleural effusion, increased in size compared to the
 previous study.
 5. Continued right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
