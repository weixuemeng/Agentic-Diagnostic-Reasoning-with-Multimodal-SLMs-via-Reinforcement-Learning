                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough for three days.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
 contours are normal.  Consolidative opacity in the anterior basal right lower
 lobe is compatible with pneumonia.  The left lung is clear.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe pneumonia.  Followup radiographs after treatment
 are recommended to ensure resolution of this finding.
