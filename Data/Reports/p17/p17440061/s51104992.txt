                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 small right greater than left bilateral pleural effusions.  Peripheral right
 lung opacities are seen, better assessed on subsequent chest CT.  No large
 focal consolidation is seen in the left lung.  There is no pneumothorax. There
 is mild biapical pleural thickening.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly
 enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous.  No overt pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 
 Opacity along the periphery of the right lung is concerning for infection, as
 also seen on chest CT.  Recommend followup imaging if symptoms recur after
 treatment.
