                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent cellulitis, now with persistent fever, assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Cervical
 spinal hardware is seen in the lower neck and right shoulder prosthesis is
 noted.  There is diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema.  A subtle superimposed
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size remains top normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 stable.  No acute bony injuries are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema.  Recommend post-diuresis films to
 exclude underlying subtle pneumonia.
