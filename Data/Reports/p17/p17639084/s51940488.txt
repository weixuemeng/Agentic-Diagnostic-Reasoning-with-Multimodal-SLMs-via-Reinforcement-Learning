                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Status post massive transfusion.  Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates constant position of
 endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right internal jugular central venous
 line.  Compared to the prior study, there is continued mild pulmonary edema
 with small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are essentially normal accounting for differences
 in patient positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Stable monitoring and support devices.
