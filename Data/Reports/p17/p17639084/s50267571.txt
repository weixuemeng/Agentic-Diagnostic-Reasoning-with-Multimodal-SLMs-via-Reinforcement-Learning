 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with weakness.  Evaluate for acute
 process/port placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right Port-A-Cath tip ends in the proximal right atrium, probably unchanged
 in position when accounting for differences along volume.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and probable cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement. 
 No pleural effusion.  Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Aortic knob
 calcifications are unchanged.  Tortuous descending thoracic aorta.  Partially
 imaged right shoulder replacement and cervical spinal hardware are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.  .
 2.  No focal pneumonia.
 3.  Right Port-A-Cath tip ends in the proximal right atrium, probably
 unchanged in position when accounting for differences in lung volumes between
 exams.
