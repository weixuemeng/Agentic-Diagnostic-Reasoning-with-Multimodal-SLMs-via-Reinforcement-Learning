                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hx IPH, poor airway clearance, hx aspiration, eval for
 acute process or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Platelike atelectasis is noted bilaterally.  Low lung volumes cause
 bronchovascular crowding.  There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Gaseous distention of the bowel in the
 left upper quadrant has increased slightly compared with the prior study. 
 Apparent inferior subluxation of the left humeral head appears stable from the
 most recent prior study.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
 limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Slight interval increase in gaseous distention of bowel in the left upper
 quadrant.
