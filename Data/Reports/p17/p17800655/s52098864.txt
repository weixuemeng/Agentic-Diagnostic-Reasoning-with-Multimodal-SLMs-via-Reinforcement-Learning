                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  With this factor in mind, heart is upper limits
 of normal in size, and pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Predominantly linear
 bibasilar opacities are present, likely representing a combination of linear
 atelectasis and scarring.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
