                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs remain hyperexpanded with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms.  Bibasilar opacities are again noted and likely represent
 bibasilar fibrosis and bronchiectasis; though aspiration may overly these
 findings. Heart size remains top normal.  Diffusely enlarged thoracoabdominal
 aorta is again noted.  Clips are visualized in the mid abdomen from prior
 aortic repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities are likely representative of chronic fibrosis and
 bronchiectasis. 
 2.  Thoracoabdominal aortic ectasia is again noted.
