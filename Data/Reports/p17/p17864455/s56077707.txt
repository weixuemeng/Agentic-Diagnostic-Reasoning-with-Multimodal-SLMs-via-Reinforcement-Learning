                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear likely unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava, as before.  Minimal basilar opacities suggest minor
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary vascularity is slightly prominent suggesting pulmonary
 vascular hypertension or slight fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting slight pulmonary congestion and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  However, if pulmonary symptoms concerning for pneumonia are
 present, then short-term followup radiographs could be considered with better
 inspiration.
