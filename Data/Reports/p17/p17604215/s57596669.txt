                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Severe upper abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT of the chest from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a linear opacity in the right mid lung zone, which is
 likely due to scarring from the prior lung abscess.  There is an ill-defined
 patchy consolidation at the right medial base.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
 There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There are multiple prominent
 air-filled loops of presumably large bowel in the left upper quadrant.  There
 is no free intraperitoneal air.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy vague opacity at the right base is likely atelectasis in the
 setting of low lung volumes.  In the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot
 be completely excluded, however.
 
 2.  Stable right upper lobe scarring from the prior abscess.
 
 3.  Prominent air-filled loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant.  Consider
 dedicated imaging with upright and supine views of the abdomen.
