                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post exploratory laparotomy.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right subclavian artery stent is again seen.  Unchanged calcific densities
 projecting over the apices bilaterally could represent vascular calcification.
 Normal heart size.  Normal mediastinal and hilar contours.  New retrocardiac
 opacity and decreased left lung volume is consistent with left basilar
 atelectasis.  Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect subsegmental
 atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, left basilar atelectasis in the setting of recent surgery.
