                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with pneumonia, question CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is interval improvement in airspace opacity in the left mid
 lung, likely from improvement in aspiration pneumonitis.  The lungs
 demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, new from prior
 without effusion or pneumothorax. Right parahilar airspace opacity likely
 reflects aspiration.  The pulmonary vasculature remains normal.  The cardiac
 silhouette is normal in size, and the aortic contour is tortuous with note of
 atherosclerotic calcification.  A two-lead left chest pacemaker is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar atelectasis, with interval improvement in left mid lung
 airspace abnormality consistent with improved aspiration pneumonitis.  There
 is new bibasilar atelectasis and right parahilar airspace opacity .
