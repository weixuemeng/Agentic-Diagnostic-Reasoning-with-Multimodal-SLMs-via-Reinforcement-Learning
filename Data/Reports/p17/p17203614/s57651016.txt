                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:56 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG.  Respiratory failure.  Suspect right pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 7:33 a.m.:
 
 Lung volumes are slightly greater, but there has been no real change in
 extensive consolidation in both lower lungs and small-to-moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Some of the opacification in the
 left lower lobe is presumably atelectasis, but much of the other opacification
 should be attributed to pneumonia.
 
 ET tube, transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads, right
 subclavian central venous catheter, are in standard placements, feeding tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view, and a right supraclavicular catheter
 set ends in the right atrium.  No pneumothorax.
