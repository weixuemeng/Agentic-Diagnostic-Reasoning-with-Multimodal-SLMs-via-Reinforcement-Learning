                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 3:00 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post CABG, status post bronchoscopy. 
 Check endotracheal tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 1:35 a.m.
 
 Semi-erect chest film from ___ at 3:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Feeding tube, right internal jugular central line and right subclavian
 central lines are unchanged.  There has been interval intubation with the
 endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3.5-4 cm above the carina. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median
 sternotomy for CABG.  There are layering effusions, right greater than left. 
 There is improved aeration in the left lung with persistent more consolidative
 opacity in the perihilar region and in the right mid-to-lower lung.  These
 findings could reflect pulmonary edema with some interval improvement,
 although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  No pneumothorax. 
 Left-sided pacer is unchanged.
