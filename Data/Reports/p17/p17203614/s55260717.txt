                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There is moderate cardiomegaly.  Transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in
 standard position, in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in the standard position.  HD catheter is in the standard position.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, are
 again noted.  Right lower lobe opacities have increased, could be due to
 increasing consolidation or increasing in the pleural effusions.  Left lower
 lobe consolidation is unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
