                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Decreased O2 sats at rest.  Atelectasis or pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The aorta is slightly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  On a background of mild pulmonary
 edema and low lung volumes, there are bibasilar opacifications, right greater
 than left, likely atelectasis although pneumonia can not be excluded. Mild
 degenerative changes in thoracic spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema.  Basilar opacification, may be due to atelectasis,
 consolidation not excluded.  Elevated/eventration of right hemidiaphragm seen
 on subsequent CT.
