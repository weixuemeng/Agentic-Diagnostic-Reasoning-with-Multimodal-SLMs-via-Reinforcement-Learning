                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and left upper quadrant pain with cold symptoms.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The chest is hyperinflated.  Nipple
 shadows are unchanged bilaterally.  Streaky opacities in the lingula are
 unchanged and suggest minor scarring or atelectasis.  There is exaggerated
 kyphotic curvature, but vertebral body heights and interspaces appear
 preserved aside from mild narrowing of anterior interspaces along the site of
 maximal kyphotic curvature.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
