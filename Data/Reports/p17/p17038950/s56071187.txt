                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with upper abdominal pain, pneumonia?
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exams
 from ___.
 
 Despite improved inspiratory effort on the current exam, there is evidence of
 increased interstitial markings throughout, with more confluent opacity at the
 right lung base and on the left laterally.  Dense mitral annular
 calcifications are seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  Right subclavian central line is seen with tip at the RA-SVC
 junction.  Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings are seen bilaterally, raising
 possibility of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Superimposed bibasilar
 opacities, potentially due to atelectasis; however, developing consolidation
 from infection is also possible.  Clinical correlation suggested.
