 left IJ line is seen with tip projecting slightly superiorly, potentially
 within the azygos vein.  There is thin sliver of lucency at the left lung apex
 which could be projectional and due to overlying sheet however small
 pneumothorax is not completely excluded and repeat exam is suggested. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable notable for dense mitral annular
 calcifications.  Osseous structures are stable noting degenerative changes at
 the left shoulder.
