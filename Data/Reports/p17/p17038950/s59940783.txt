                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypotension with recent intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been
 removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
 
 There is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the
 hemidiaphragm.  This is most likely related to atelectatic changes and
 possible small effusion.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
