                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p mechanical fall down to stairs landing on right side w/
 multiple Rt. ___ rib fractures w. large PTX, Rt. clavicular fx and Rt. zygoma
 and orbital fxs s/p CT placement at OSH  // interval changes?    interval
 changes?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema extending from the left neck through the upper abdomen.
 Pectoral air overlying the right lung makes it difficult to assess for
 pneumothorax, though no definite pleural line is appreciated. There is
 increasing opacification at the right base consistent with some combination of
 atelectasis and aspiration. In the appropriate clinical setting, a
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
 Otherwise little change.
