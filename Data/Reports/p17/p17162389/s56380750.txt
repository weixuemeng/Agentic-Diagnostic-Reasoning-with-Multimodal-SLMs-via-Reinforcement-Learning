                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tracheostomy  // Please assess for
 pneumothorax
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:28.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube has been replaced by a tracheostomy tube which may not be perfectly
 centered, but lung volumes are maintained, and in fact atelectasis in the
 right upper lobe has decreased. Unfortunately aeration of the right lower lobe
 has worsened.  I would recommend evaluation of the airway with conventional
 chest radiographs when feasible.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema persists, and there is still moderate right pleural
 effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly stable.  No pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends
 in the upper SVC.
