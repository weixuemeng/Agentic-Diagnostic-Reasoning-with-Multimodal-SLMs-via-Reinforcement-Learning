                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fall down stairs, multiple right-sided rib fractures, right clavicle
 fracture, right zygoma and orbital fractures, chest tube for large
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A left
 subclavian PICC line is present, tip near SVC/RA junction.  Additional tubing
 overlies the right chest, presumably a right-sided chest tube.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.  The superior mediastinal contours on
 the right are poorly defined, with opacity in the right upper zone.  There is
 additional dense opacity in the right mid and lower zones, slightly worse
 compared with one day earlier.  Small right effusion is likely also present. 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is mild diffuse vascular plethora. 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is noted adjacent to the right chest wall.  
 
 The patient's right scapular fracture is noted.  Deformity of the right chest
 is consistent with known fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval worsening of opacification in the right mid zone.  Differential
 diagnosis includes hemorrhage and/or infection.  CHF is considered less
 likely, given the focality of the abnormality.
 
 2.  Patchy opacities in the right upper zone, similar to the prior film.
 Probable small right effusion, not significantly changed.
 
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse. 
 
 4.  CHF findings, likely slightly worse.
 
 5.  No pneumothorax detected.
