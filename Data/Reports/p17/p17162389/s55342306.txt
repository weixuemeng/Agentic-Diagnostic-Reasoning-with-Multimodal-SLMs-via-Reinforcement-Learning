                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p chest tube pulled (had 3, now has 1), please
 do x-ray around ___:30  // pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___ at 6
 08:00.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small right pleural effusion has increased since ___:00 following removal of 2
 of 3 pleural drains, 1 remaining ends at the apex.  Moderate cardiomegaly has
 increased, suggesting that some of the increased density in the left lung is
 due to vascular congestion. On several recent radiographs it was a suggestion
 of left lung nodules. As soon as feasible patient should have conventional
 chest radiographs to investigate this. There is no left pneumothorax.
 
 Left PIC line ends in the mid to low SVC and a nasogastric tube ending in the
 upper stomach would need to be advanced about 8 cm to move all the side ports
 below the diaphragm.
