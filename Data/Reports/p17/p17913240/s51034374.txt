                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, wheezing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with a
 small left pleural effusion slightly increased from the prior study. Patchy
 opacities in the lung bases are also increased, and may reflect atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Slightly increased small left pleural
 effusion with worsening opacities in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis
 but infection is not excluded.
