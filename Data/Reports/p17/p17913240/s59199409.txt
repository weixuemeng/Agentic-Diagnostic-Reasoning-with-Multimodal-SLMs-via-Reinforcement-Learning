 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hiv cap pleural effusion  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a small to moderate left
 pleural effusion has slightly increased in size with adjacent worsening left
 retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation.  In contrast, right basilar
 opacification has improved and small right pleural effusion has slightly
 decreased slightly. Distended loops of bowel in the imaged upper abdomen are
 incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph.
