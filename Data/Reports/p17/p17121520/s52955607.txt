 FINDINGS:
 
 There has been interval endotracheal intubation with the tip terminating 5.2
 cm cranial to the carina in standard position.  A large bore right internal
 jugular central venous catheter remains with the tip positioned in the right
 atrium.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.  There
 is mild central vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema. 
 Reticulonodular opacities throughout all right lung fields have intervally
 increased with associated small right-sided pleural effusion.  The left lung
 remains essentially clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval worsening of right-sided multifocal pneumonia with small pleural
 effusion.
