 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, large volume administration day prior, question pulmonary
 edema, effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW.
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  There is prominence of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, likely accentuated by lung volumes, similar to
 the film from ___.  There are diffuse increased interstitial markings. 
 Possible small left and trace right effusion.  Compared with the prior film,
 these have increased slightly, though are accentuated by differences in film
 technique.  A right-sided line, ? dual-lumen, is again seen, tip overlying the
 right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSion:  Increased interstitial markings, which could reflect CHF. 
 Findings are slightly worse compared with one day earlier.
