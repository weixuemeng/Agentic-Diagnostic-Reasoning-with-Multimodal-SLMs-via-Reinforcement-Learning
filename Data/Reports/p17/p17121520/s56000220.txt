                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with recent line removed, now with chest
 pain, evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of
 ___.  Comparison demonstrates that the previously existing
 left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line has been removed. 
 The right-sided central venous line remains in unchanged position.  No
 pneumothorax has developed.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be
 identified.  The previously existing pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has
 further decreased.  The lateral pleural sinuses are free, but the supine
 position of the patient makes evaluation of pleural effusion impossible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Removal of central venous line without evidence of pneumothorax.
