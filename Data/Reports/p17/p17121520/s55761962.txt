                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and
 nasogastric tubes have been removed.  There is again mild prominence of the
 cardiac silhouette with bibasilar opacifications consistent with volume loss
 in the lower lungs and effusions.  Central catheters remain in place.  There
 is engorgement of somewhat ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
