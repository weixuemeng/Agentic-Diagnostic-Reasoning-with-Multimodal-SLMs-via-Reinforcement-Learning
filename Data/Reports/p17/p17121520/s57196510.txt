 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post transplant, graft-versus-host disease, evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the appearance of
 the hilar and mediastinal structures is constant.  Minimal atelectatic changes
 could be present at the right lung base.
 
 However, if clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection persists, and given the
 higher sensitivity of CT for detecting this pathology in immunocompromised
 patients, CT of the chest is recommended to rule out pneumonia.
