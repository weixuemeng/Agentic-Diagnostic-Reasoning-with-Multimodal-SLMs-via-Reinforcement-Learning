                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  Images for radiation treatment planning.  No diagnostic
 interpretation.  Include metallic ring in the right axilla in both PA and
 lateral projections along with entire chest.  A total of four chest images
 were obtained.  Grossly the clinical findings are unchanged in comparison with
 the next preceding standard PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  It is observed, however, that at that time existing left-sided
 Port-A-Cath system has been removed.  Two additional films were obtained
 including the right axillar area demonstrating presence of a metallic ring
 with approximately 3 cm diameter to be located at the soft tissue surface of
 the right lateral chest wall at level of eight and nine rib in the medial
 axillary line.  On the left lateral view, the open metallic ring seen to be
 located just below the hilar structures projects at the level of the left
 atrial posterior contour.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings after removal of Port-A-Cath system.
