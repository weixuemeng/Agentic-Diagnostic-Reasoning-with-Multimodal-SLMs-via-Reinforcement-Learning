  Unchanged right central venous catheter with tip in right atrium.  unchanged
  opacity of the left lung with minimal opacity in the right lower lung zone;
  the differential remains broad and coule be infectious or asymmetric edema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:37 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man intubated.  Check ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Newly placed endotracheal tube in standard position.  Upper enteric tube also
 in standard position in the upper stomach.  A dual-channel right
 supraclavicular central venous line ends in the right atrium.  The lungs are
 still very low in volume, and severe infiltrative abnormality involves the
 left lung, with a less severe abnormality on the right, probably edema. 
 Although the findings could be explained by asymmetric edema, pulmonary
 hemorrhage and pneumonia in the left lung are genuine considerations.  No
 pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable in size.
