                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ ___   
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Apparent
 worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion, accompanied by enlarging bilateral
 pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left.  Diffuse
 haziness throughout the imaged upper and mid abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
