                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Projecting over the interspace between the left posterior ___ and 8th ribs,
 there is a small focal opacity which may represent a focus of infection.  The
 right lung is clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small focal opacity projecting over the left mid to lower lung could represent
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  Recommend followup to
 resolution.
