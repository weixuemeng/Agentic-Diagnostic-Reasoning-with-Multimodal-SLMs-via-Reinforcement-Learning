 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with fever and left flank pain, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are relatively low.  Streaky opacities at the left
 lung base likely represent atelectasis.  No focal consolidation concerning for
 pneumonia, significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The cardiac silhouette appears top
 normal in size in the setting of low lung volumes.  The mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits.  The trachea is midline.  There is no evidence of
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky opacities at the left lung base likely represent
 atelectasis.
