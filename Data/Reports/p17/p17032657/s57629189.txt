                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea and O2 sat ___% on room air  // r/o
 acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are persistent reticular nodular opacities, most pronounced in the right
 mid to lower lung and also present in the left lung, notably in the left mid
 to lower lung, although overall appear less conspicuous in the left lung as
 compared to the prior study.  Evidence of bronchiectasis, particular involving
 the right mid to lower lung and to a lesser extent the left lung base again
 seen.  Right base opacity persists, which may be combination bronchiectasis
 and mucous plugging.  Evidence of a moderate to large hiatal hernia is also
 seen, with retrocardiac air-fluid level.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent reticular nodular opacities in this patient with history of
 bronchiectasis/chronic lung disease.  Right base opacity persists, may be
 combination bronchiectasis and mucous plugging, underlying infection is
 difficult to exclude.
 
 Hiatal hernia.
