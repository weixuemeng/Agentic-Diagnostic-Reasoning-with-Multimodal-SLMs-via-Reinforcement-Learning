                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough, hypoxia  // PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is a diffuse centrilobular nodular pattern with widespread
 bronchiectasis, consistent with chronic airways disease.  Previously noted
 right lung base consolidation is similar in appearance, and may represent
 pneumonia and/or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  No subdiaphragmatic free air. 
 There is S-shaped curvature of the thoracolumbar spine.  Hiatal hernia noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged diffuse acute on chronic chronic small airways disease, with
 possible superimposed pneumonia or atelectasis at the right lung base.
