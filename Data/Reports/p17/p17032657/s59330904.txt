                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and bronchiectasis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Again, there is substantial scoliosis of the thoracic spine convex to
 the right.  There are bibasilar opacifications, most likely reflecting a
 combination of bronchiectasis and atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be extremely difficult to exclude the possibility of an
 acute infectious process.
