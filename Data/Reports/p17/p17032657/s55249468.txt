                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with bronchiectasis, recent admission for pneumonia, now with
 new hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT from outside hospital dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial thickening with bronchial wall thickening and
 bronchiectasis most prominent at the bases bilaterally, better demonstrated on
 the chest CT from outside hospital dated ___.  The previously
 visualized right lower lung opacity persists, and may reflect asymmetric
 bronchiectasis, however an underlying atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded. 
 No new focal consolidations.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Dextro convex scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine
 is re- demonstrated.  There is a moderate hiatal hernia containing an
 air-fluid level.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Persistent right basilar patchy opacification, which may represent
 asymmetric cylindrical bronchiectasis, better demonstrated on the prior CT,
 however an underlying atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 2. Hiatal hernia.
