 WET READ: ___ ___ 8:41 PM
  Little change compared to chest x-ray from ___.  Blunting of left
  costophrenic angle may be due to pleural thickening or a chronic small
  effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Linear density overlying left
  upper quadrant may be something outside of the patient - correlate clinically.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 18:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with lymphoma, cough, any signs of
 infection.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 12:03.
 
 AP upright portable chest film, ___ at 6:44 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal
 SVC, near the cavoatrial junction.  Heart remains enlarged, which may reflect
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. 
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is persistent minimal blunting the
 left costophrenic angle, which may represent a tiny effusion or chronic
 pleural thickening.  Streaky linear opacities at the left base may reflect
 areas of atelectasis or scarring.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Linear
 density overlying the left upper quadrant is likely external to the patient,
 but clinical correlation would be recommended.
