                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aspiration // Consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding.  There is a persistent
 consolidation and volume loss in the right upper and left lower lobes.  A
 small right and small to moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged from the
 prior study.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The
 thoracic aorta is tortuous. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line
 ends in  the cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach
 and ends in the duodenum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent consolidation and volume loss in the right upper and left lower
 lobes, not significantly changed from the prior study. This may represent
 aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
