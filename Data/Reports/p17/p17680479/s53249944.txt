 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is persisting consolidation

 small to moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged. A right-sided internal jugular central
 venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube courses into
 the stomach and likely ends in the duodenum.

 Persistent consolidation and volume loss in the right upper and left lower
