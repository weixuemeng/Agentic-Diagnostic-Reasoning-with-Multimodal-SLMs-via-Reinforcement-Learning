                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman  // eval line/effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carinal.  A right central venous
 line ends at the cavoatrial junction. A transesophageal tube ends in the
 stomach.  Postoperative atelectasis in the right lower lobe is moderately
 severe. The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 The mediastinum is markedly widened by the generally large and elongated
 thoracic aorta, less so by the dilated pulmonary arteries, as confirmed by the
 the same-day chest CTA. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema.
 Air beneath the chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm reflects recent
 abdominal surgery.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Postoperative right lower lobe atelectasis.  The widened mediastinum
 corresponds to a large elongated thoracic aorta and to lesser extent dilated
 pulmonary arteries. Small postoperative pneumoperitoneum.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  ___ discussed with ___ at ___ ___.
