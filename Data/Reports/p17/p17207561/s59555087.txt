                                 FINAL REPORT

 and fever.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are well inflated.  This
 potentially new opacity in the right lower lung, most likely reflecting area
 of atelectasis, but aspiration would be another possibility.
 
 Although there is a suspicion for a fracture of the posterior aspect of the
 right tenth rib, not clearly seen on the prior examination:  New?
