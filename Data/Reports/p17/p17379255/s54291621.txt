                                 FINAL REPORT
 Hx: Bacturia and bacteremia, spiking fevers.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No prior CXRs on pacs record for comparison.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning. The heart is not enlarged.  There is upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is minimal patchy opacity at the
 right base, with slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No pleural
 effusion.
 
 Incidental note is made of a small focus of hydroxyapatite adjacent to the
 left humeral head.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect
 the presence of calcific tendinitis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Subtle patchy opacity at the right base represents atelectasis. The
 possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate is considered less likely, but
 cannot be entirely excluded.
