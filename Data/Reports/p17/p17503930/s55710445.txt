                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, dyspnea, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  Mediastinal
 contour is unremarkable.  Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of COPD. 
 Enlargement of the hila bilaterally suggests dilated pulmonary arteries which
 can be seen with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Mildly increased diffuse interstitial opacities may be due to a
 chronic interstitial lung abnormality, but no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are mild degenerative changes noted
 in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse increased interstitial opacities may be due to a chronic interstitial
 lung disease.    No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Enlargement of
 pulmonary arteries suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with prior imaging is recommended, and
 consider further assessment with high-resolution chest CT.
