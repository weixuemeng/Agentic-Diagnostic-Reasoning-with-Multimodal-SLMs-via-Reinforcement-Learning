                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left effusion, to assess for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular catheter terminates at the superior
 cavoatrial junction.  Right costophrenic sulcus is excluded from the image. 
 Lungs are low in volume.  Aside from atelectasis at the right lung base, the
 right lung is well aerated.  The left lung is slightly better aerated than on
 the prior study with minimal decrease in left pleural effusion though some of
 it appears to be collected in a nondependent location, perhaps within the
 major fissure.  Mild cardiomegaly is noted and slightly decreased from the
 prior study.  Median sternotomy wires as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall likely unchanged to minimally decreased left pleural
 effusion, with a portion collecting in a non-dependent fashion, perhaps within
 the major fissure.
