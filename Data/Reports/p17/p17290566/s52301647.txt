                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male, status post CABG.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 9:10 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The intra-aortic balloon pump has been advanced such as the tip
 projects over the upper portion of the aortic arch, approximately 8 mm from
 the top of the arch; retraction may be considered by about 2 cm.  Otherwise,
 the lines and tubes are similar in appearance.  The degree of
 cardiomediastinal widening is unchanged from 20 minutes prior.  If developing
 mediastinal hematoma is if concern, short-interval followup may be considered.
 Additionally, the left upper lobe opacity may represent aspiration or
 hemorrhage - followup as clinically indicated.
