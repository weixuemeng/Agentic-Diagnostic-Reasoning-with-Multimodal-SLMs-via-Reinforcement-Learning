                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with recent traumatic SAH presents with seizure like
 activity, congested cough. Assess: For consolidation. ___ read: read uploaded
 CT head from ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___. ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrate interval retraction of a
 right PICC tip which is now within the right mid subclavian vein.  For optimal
 positioning in the mid to lower SVC the catheter must be advanced 6-7 cm.
 
 Persistently symmetrically hypoinflated lungs with stable bilateral perihilar
 interstitial opacities consistent with vascular crowding. Stable retrocardiac
 atelectasis with stable small left pleural effusion. Significant decrease in
 size of a previously identified loculated left pleural effusion along the
 lateral left chest wall. No right pleural effusion. Stable air-fluid level
 seen on lateral chest radiograph is consistent with known hiatal hernia. No
 new focal opacity. No pneumothorax.
 
 Limited assessment upper abdomen is unremarkable and visualized osseous
 structures are notable for prior healed left femoral head fracture, unchanged
 from previous examination. Kyphosis again noted with diffuse osteopenia and
 multiple thoracic compression fractures, unchanged from previous examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Mild Right PICC with tip within the mid right subclavian vein.
 2. Hypoinflated lungs.
 3. Stable retrocardiac atelectasis and small left pleural effusion with
 significant decrease in size of previously identified loculated left pleural
 effusion.
 4.  Small hiatal hernia.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 12:01 PM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
