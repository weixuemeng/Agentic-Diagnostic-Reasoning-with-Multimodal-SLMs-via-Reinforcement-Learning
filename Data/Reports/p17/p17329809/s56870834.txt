                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with empyema s/p drainage.  // Interval change 
 Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 10:18 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, the lung volumes have increased and the diffuse bilateral pulmonary
 process has improved suggesting that there was a component of superimposed
 pulmonary edema which has now resolved.  The right lung is grossly clear. 
 There is a loculated left pleural collection which probably has not
 significantly changed since ___. There is relative lucency in
 the left costophrenic sulcus which could reflect a loculated pneumothorax.  No
 pleural line can be seen at the left apex.  There is continued blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle which likely reflects a small effusion.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given marked patient
 rotation on the current study.  There is marked thoracic kyphosis with
 multiple vertebral compression fractures, the chronicity of which can not be
 determined. A inferior vena caval filter is partially visualized. Followup
 imaging may be helpful to assess for re-accumulation of the left pleural
 collection.
