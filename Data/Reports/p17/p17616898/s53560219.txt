 demonstrated.  Minimal decrease in the right upper lobe volume is noted.  Left
 of the low rest of the lungs are clear
 
 Right lower lung and left lung essentially clear.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.

 giving the provided history less-likely.
 
 Correlation with chest CT is recommended.
