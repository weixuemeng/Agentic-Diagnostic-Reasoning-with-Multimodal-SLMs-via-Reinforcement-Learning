  1. Mild cardiomegaly with central vascular congestion, mild interstitial
  pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions, right greater than left, consistent
  with acute cardiac decompensation.
  2. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis, less
  likely aspiration or infection. Recommend correlation with physical exam
  findings.

  cardiac decompensation.
  2. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis, less
  likely aspiration. Recommend correlation with physical exam findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with hypoxia  // eval pneumonia, other acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post aortic valve replacement and CABG with median
 sternotomy wires in place.  Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, which is
 likely mildly enlarged.  There is central vascular congestion with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  Small right pleural effusion.  Probable trace
 left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Bibasilar parenchymal opacities, left
 greater than right, suggest atelectasis, though aspiration cannot be
 definitively excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild cardiomegaly with central vascular congestion, mild interstitial
 pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions, right greater than left, consistent
 with acute cardiac decompensation.
 2. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis, less
 likely aspiration or infection.  Recommend correlation with physical exam
 findings.
