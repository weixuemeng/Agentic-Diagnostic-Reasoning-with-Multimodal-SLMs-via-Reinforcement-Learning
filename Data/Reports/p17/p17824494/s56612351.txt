 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left chest tube, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 left chest tube.  The tube is in correct position.  The extent of the
 pre-existing left pleural effusion has substantially decreased.  A small
 effusion at the level of the costophrenic sinus persists.  Correct position of
 the left pigtail catheter.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, with moderate cardiomegaly, mild fluid
 overload, and axillary left-sided clips.
