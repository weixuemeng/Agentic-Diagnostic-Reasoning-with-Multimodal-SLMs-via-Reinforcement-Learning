 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains markedly enlarged, which could be due to cardiomyopathy
 and/or pericardial effusion.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion with
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  Mild interstitial edema is seen.  There is
 prominence of the pulmonary arteries which may be due to component of
 pulmonary arterial hypertension.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Surgical clips are noted overlying the left axilla.
