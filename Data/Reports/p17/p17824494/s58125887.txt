                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema x.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. 
 Prominence and indistinctness of the hila is consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Increased opacity
 along the right heart border could be due to increase in cardiac silhouette
 size/pericardial effusion, however, loculated effusion without possible
 partial collapse is not excluded.  There is prominence of the superior
 mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased bilateral pleural effusions with increased cardiac silhouette size
 and pulmonary edema is most consistent with CHF.  Increased opacity at the
 right heart border unclear whether could relate to partially loculated pleural
 effusion, partial collapse or/and enlarged cardiac silhouette size.
