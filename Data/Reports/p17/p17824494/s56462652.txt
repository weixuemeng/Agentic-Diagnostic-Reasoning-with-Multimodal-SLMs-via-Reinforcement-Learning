                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is again markedly enlarged.  Fullness of the left hilum suggests
 mild vascular congestion.  There is increased opacification at the base of the
 left chest suggesting a combination of possible pleural effusion and
 parenchymal opacification.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion.  Increased left basilar
 opacification including suspicion for pleural effusion.  Differential
 considerations include atelectasis but pneumonia is not excluded.
