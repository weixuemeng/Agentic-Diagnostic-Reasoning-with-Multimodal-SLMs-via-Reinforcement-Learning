                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:05 P.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with smoking history and shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Mild interstitial edema and congestion of pulmonary vessels and mediastinal
 veins are new.  Greater opacification at the lung bases is probably a
 combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, but I cannot exclude
 infection.  Transvenous pacer lead ends in the region of the right ventricular
 apex.  Pleural effusion, if present, is small.  No pneumothorax.
