                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  There is diffuse increase in markings, central predominate,
 suggesting fluid overload.  There is subtle focal patchy right upper lung
 opacity and a small focus of infection is not excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  More focal patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone, focus of infection
 not excluded.
