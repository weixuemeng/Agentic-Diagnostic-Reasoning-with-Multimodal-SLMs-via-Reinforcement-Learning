                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Small left pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is moderately to
 moderately severe cardiomegaly with a calcified unfolded aorta.  Prominence of
 the pulmonary hila with tapered appearance raises question of pulmonary
 hypertension.  No widening of the mediastinum is detected.  
 
 There is small amount of pleural fluid or thickening at the left lung apex and
 a small nodular opacity measuring approximately 4.9 mm seen laterally between
 the posterior fourth and fifth ribs.  A very tiny left apical pneumothorax is
 likely present. Probable pleural thickening along the right lung apex as well.
 There is minimal atelectasis at the left greater than right lung bases.  Small
 posterior left effusion noted on the lateral view. 
 
 Multiple left-sided rib fractures  and left midclavicualr fracture are again
 noted, without appreciable displacement. Evidence for chronic bilateral
 rotator cuff tears again seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Compared with ___,there is new minimal atelectasis at the left base.
 Trace left pleural effusion noted posteriorly on the lateral view. Otherwise,
 no significant change.   Tiny left apical pneumothorax remains visible.  
 
 2) No CHF.
