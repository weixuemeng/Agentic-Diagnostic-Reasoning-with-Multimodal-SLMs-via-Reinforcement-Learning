                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers of uncertain etiology. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___. CT of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are low and linear opacities at the bases most likely
 represent atelectasis.  Otherwise there is little change.  There is no focal
 consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema.  The small
 subpleural nodule seen on the prior CT of the chest are not well visualized on
 today's exam. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is
 identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A metallic biliary
 stent is present in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. No definite
 pneumonia.
