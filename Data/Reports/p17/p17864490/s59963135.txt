                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest (AP and lateral)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with question of neutropenic fever and dyspnea;
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiograph views of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.  PA and lateral
 chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are overall unchanged from the prior
 exam.  Lung volumes are low, overall unchanged.  Bilateral nodular opacities
 are compatible with known metastases.  Compared to ___, increased
 opacification bilaterally and most visible the lateral view is noted and could
 represent focal consolidations with pneumonia and/or metastases.  Visualized
 mediastinal silhouette is also unchanged.  The left PICC line has since been
 removed, and a right Port-A-Cath since been placed with its tip ending in the
 right atrium.  No pneumothorax.  Biliary stent projecting over the right upper
 quadrant appears unchanged in position.  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Bilateral slight increased opacities, could represent infection and/or
 metastatic disease.
 2.  Overall stable bilateral moderate pleural effusions and lower lung
 volumes.
 3.  Interval removal of left PICC line and placement of right Port-A-Cath
 which ends in the upper right atrium near the cavoatrial junction.
