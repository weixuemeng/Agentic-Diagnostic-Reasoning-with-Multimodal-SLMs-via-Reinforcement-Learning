                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pancreatic cancer presents with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits. Ill-defined pleural and parenchymal nodular opacities
 are seen diffusely throughout the lungs bilaterally with continued diffuse
 increased interstitial opacities worrisome for lymphangitic spread of tumor.
 Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are unchanged. Streaky
 opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Partially imaged is a common bile duct stent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior radiograph. Continued moderate
 size left and small right pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities, likely
 atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. Diffuse pulmonary
 and pleural nodules compatible with metastases as well as lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis as seen previously.
