                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate PICC positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a left
 PICC, which likely terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There is improved
 aeration of the bilateral lungs, with unchanged bilateral parenchymal
 opacities consistent with known metastatic disease.  Bilateral small to
 moderate pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a left PICC, which terminates at the cavoatrial
 junction.
