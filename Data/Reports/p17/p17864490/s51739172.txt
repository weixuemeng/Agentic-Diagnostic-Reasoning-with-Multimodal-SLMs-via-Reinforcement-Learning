                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with fevers  // infiltrate?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes are again noted with crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings. There are persistent bibasilar opacities which could
 represent any combination of atelectasis and effusion with possible
 superimposed infection. Superiorly the lungs are clear of consolidation. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extremely low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular markings and
 likely bibasilar atelectasis. Super imposed infection would be possible.
 Repeat exam with improved aeration may help further assess.
