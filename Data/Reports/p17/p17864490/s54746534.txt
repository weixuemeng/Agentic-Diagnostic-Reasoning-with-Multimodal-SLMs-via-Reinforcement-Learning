                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Fever, right lower quadrant pain, and vomiting.  Status post
 appendectomy.  Metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Port-A-Cath terminates in the uppermost atrium.  Lung volumes are low,
 obscuring cardiac borders, but there is no clear change in cardiac,
 mediastinal or hilar borders.  There is new opacification at the left lung
 base suggesting a pleural effusion.  There is a small, persistent left-sided
 pneumothorax, but decreased.  On the right, although pleural effusion has
 decreased, there is new focal opacity at the right lung base in addition to
 diffuse increased opacification of each lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased diffuse opacification suggesting pulmonary edema or possibly
 widespread pneumonia.  New right base opacity suggesting atelectasis,
 potentially pneumonia.  Persistent but decreased left-sided pneumothorax.
