                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary hypertension, desatting with
 ambulating.  // Any changes from previous films? Pulmonary vasculature?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the radiographs obtained 8 days prior, there has been interval removal
 of a Swan-Ganz catheter and placement of a tunneled central venous catheter,
 which terminates in the lower SVC.  Pulmonary vascular prominence is less
 marked and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema or effusion.  No focal
 consolidations or masses.  There is linear focus of atelectasis in the left
 lower lung.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vasculature is less prominent without evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Interval removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter and placement of a tunneled central
 venous line which terminates in the lower SVC.  No radiographic evidence of
 pneumonia.
