                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough, malaise.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs
 remain hyperinflated and there is bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  Relative
 lucency in the upper lobe suggests pulmonary emphysema.  The known large
 hiatal hernia is again seen with air-fluid level appreciated.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Pulmonary emphysema and
 bibasilar atelectasis/scarring.  Large hiatal hernia.
