 demonstrated.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  The pulmonary arteries remain mildly prominent lymph
 bilaterally.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
 patchy opacities, potentially atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded.

 No large pneumothorax is present.  Multiple acutely displaced right-sided rib
 fractures are seen.

 Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, likely
 atelectasis, but aspiration is not excluded.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Multiple right-sided rib fractures.
