                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SLE and respiratory complaints, transferred from outside hospital
 for management of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray obtained at ___ on ___.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There are
 small-to-moderate bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is atelectasis in one of the midsones, more likely the
 the left-sided lingula, with anterior/upward bowing of the pleural surface on
 the lateral view.  No CHF.  No upper zone infiltrates or obvious upper zone
 scarring.  There is mild-to-moderate prominence of the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  The aorta is calcified and minimally unfolded.  Mild prominence
 of the hila is suggested.  No enlargement of the superior mediastinum is seen.
 
 
 There are mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine, with
 slight superior endplate scalloping of the ?T8 vertebral body, unchanged. 
 Nonacute fracture of a left mid zone posterior rib laterally, ? the seventh
 rib, is noted.  The rib fracture is new compared with ___. Note is also
 made of soft tissue anchors overlying the right humeral head.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Small bilateral effusions, with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 2.  Atelectasis/volume loss in either the lingula (more likely) or right
 middle zone.
 
 3.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No CHF.
 
 4.  Nonacute left-sided rib fracture and mild wedging of a thoracic vertebral
 body.
