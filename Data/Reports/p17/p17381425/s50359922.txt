                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:42 P.M. ON  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placed to waterseal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New tracheostomy tube is slightly askew.  No evidence of complications.  No
 pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.  The right upper pleural tube has been
 partially withdrawn, and now the most proximal side port is extrathoracic. 
 This could lead to accumulation of air or fluid in the right chest wall though
 there is no appreciable reduction of air currently.  No right pleural
 effusion.  Increased opacification at the base of the left lung is probably
 due to posteriorly collected pleural fluid, as well as basal atelectasis in
 the setting of multiple left rib fractures.  Left PIC line ends in the mid
 SVC.  The heart is normal size.
