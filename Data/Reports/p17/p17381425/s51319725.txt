 PORTABLE CHEST, ___ WITH COMPARISON ___ RADIOGRAPH
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and left PICC are unchanged in position, but
 there is apparent redundancy of the left PICC particularly in the left
 axillary region.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and
 note is made of a persistent layering moderate-sized left pleural effusion
 with adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Within the
 right hemithorax, a small pleural effusion is present as well as minimal right
 basilar atelectasis.  Multiple contiguous left rib fractures are again
 demonstrated.
