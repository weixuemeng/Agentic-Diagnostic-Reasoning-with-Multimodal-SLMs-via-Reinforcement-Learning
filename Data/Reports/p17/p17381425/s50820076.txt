 HISTORY:  Patient status post trauma now with fever, concern for infectious
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 Patient is status post extubation and removal of the left PICC line. There is
 persistent left lower lobe opacification with a large layering pleural
 effusion.  There is also a small right pleural effusion and minimal basilar
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is seen.  The heart size is
 stable.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.   Multiple left-sided
 rib fractures are again visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe opacification with layering pleural
 effusion.  While this could be atelectasis, supervening pneumonia should be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
