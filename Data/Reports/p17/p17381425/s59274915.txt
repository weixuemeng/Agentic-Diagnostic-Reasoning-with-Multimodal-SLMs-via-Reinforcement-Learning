                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pedestrian struck by MVC on ___.  Multiple rib
 fractures from right chest tube removed on ___, now with new vent
 requirement.  Please evaluate for PNA vs. fluid overload.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Trach is in appropriate position.  A left-sided PIC line terminates
 in the low SVC.  There has been significant interval improvement of the
 diffuse mild bilateral pulmonary edema.  There appears to be persistent
 consolidation at the right lung apex which could be secondary to lung
 contusion, however an infectious process cannot be excluded.  There is a
 stable small right apical pneumothorax.  Again seen are multiple rib fractures
 on the left.  No large pleural effusion is identified.  There is stable
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval improvement of the mild bilateral pulmonary edema with continued
 evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 2. Area of opacification at the right lung apex likely secondary to contusion
 from the prior chest tube; however, an infectious process cannot be excluded.
 
 3. Stable small right apical pneumothorax.
