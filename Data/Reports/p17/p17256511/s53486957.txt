                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with history of CHF, now presenting with
 altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___, and chest CT from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An AICD generator overlies the left chest
 wall and is only partially imaged.  A single lead appears intact and is in
 unchanged expected position.  There is new mild pulmonary edema.  Overall
 aeration of the left lung base is decreased compared to recent prior; the
 opacity may be due to asymmetric edema or interval development of
 aspiration/pneumonia.  The left base can be reassessed after diuresis.  The
 right lung appears clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 unchanged compared to prior examination.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  New mild pulmonary edema.  New left lower lobe opacity may be
 asymmetric edema, though underlying aspiration/pneumonia is possible. 
 Re-evaluation after diuresis is recommended.
