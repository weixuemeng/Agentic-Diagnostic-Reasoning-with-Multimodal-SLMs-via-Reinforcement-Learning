                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of congestive heart failure with worsening bilateral lower
 extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided AICD /pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the
 right ventricle, unchanged.  Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, and
 the mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Aortic knob calcifications are
 again demonstrated.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  1 cm nodular opacity is seen
 projecting over the right mid lung field, specifically over the right ___
 posterior rib, not clearly demonstrated on the prior exams.  Blunting of the
 costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral view suggest trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions, but no overt pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Rounded 1 centimeter opacity projecting over the right mid lung field
 appears new compared to the prior study.  The finding is not well localized on
 the lateral view, but nevertheless, this could reflect a nodular parenchymal
 process such as an inflammatory or infectious process.  Followup radiographs
 are recommended including oblique views for further assessment.
