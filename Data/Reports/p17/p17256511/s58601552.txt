                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and hypoxemia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the right ventricle.  Heart size is
 enlarged. Mediastinum is stable.  Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  Vascular engorgement is noted, but no
 overt pulmonary edema is noted on the current study.  There is interval
 improvement of left retrocardiac opacity which might be consistent with
 resolution of atelectasis/infection.  No interval development of appreciable
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Small amount of pleural effusion,
 though cannot be excluded.
