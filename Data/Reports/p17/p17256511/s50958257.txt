                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, history of pulmonary emboli with fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided pacemaker/AICD device with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle is unchanged.  Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette
 is re- demonstrated.  There are marked aortic knob calcifications.  Lung
 volumes are low.  This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  There are no
 displaced fractures seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
