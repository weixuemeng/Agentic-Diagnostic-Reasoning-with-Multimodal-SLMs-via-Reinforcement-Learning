 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar linear opacities, right worse than left,
 likely represent atelectasis, though focal consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 No significant pleural effusion is seen.  There is no focal consolidation,
 effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged
 osseous structures are unremarkable.

 Bibasilar opacities, right worse than left, likely atelectasis though focal
 consolidation cannot be excluded.
