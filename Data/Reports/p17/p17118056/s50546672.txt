                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes
 bilaterally.  Patient is rotated to her left.  Allowing for this, the
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear stable in appearance when compared
 to prior radiograph obtained one week prior on ___.  New since prior
 examination, there is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may reflect
 atelectasis/positioning, although an early consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may represent small effusions. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New retrocardiac opacification and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  While this may reflect atelectasis, a focal consolidation and
 early infective process cannot be excluded.
