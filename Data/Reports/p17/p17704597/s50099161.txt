                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Prior history of lung nodule, requesting followup radiographs.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is a patchy opacity projecting over the
 left lower lobe suggesting minor atelectasis or scarring.  The lungs appear
 otherwise clear.  No discrete lung nodules identified.  There are no pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild degenerative changes are present along the
 mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  No discrete lung nodule identified although there is patchy atelectasis or
 scarring in the left lower lobe.  Correlation to prior outside imaging is
 recommended regarding the history of a lung nodule.  Many lung nodules are not
 visible radiographically, including ones of substantial size.
