                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increased respiratory failure.  Question
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes which accentuates bibasilar atelectasis.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.  A battery
 pack with pacemaker leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle
 are in unchanged position. A slight increase in the retrocardiac density may
 be due to low lung volumes versus early infectious process.
 
 IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes. While ther is no overt
 evidence of pneumonia, a retrocardiac opacity in the appropriate clinical
 setting may be an early infectious process.
