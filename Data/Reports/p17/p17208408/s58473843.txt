 INDICATION:  History: ___F with chest pain  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.

 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate hyperinflated, clear
 lungs.  There is no evidence of emphysema or COPD, so the presence of
 hyperinflation is not likely clinically significant. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
 or consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
