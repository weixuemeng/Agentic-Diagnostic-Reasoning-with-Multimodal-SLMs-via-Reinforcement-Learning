                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PA and lateral chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with dypsnea  // fatigue, dyspnea, r/o
 abnormality
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiographs dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiographs obtained ___, there are new, small, left
 greater than right pleural effusions.  On lateral view, there is opacification
 of the retrosternal airspace.  Lungs are otherwise well expanded and clear
 without focal consolidations.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are normal.  There is lumbar scoliosis
 with significant associated degenerative changes.  A single button projects
 over the midline abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, small, left greater than right pleural effusions.  Opacification of the
 retrosternal airspace on the lateral view may reflect differences in patient
 rotation.  However, recommend repeating a lateral radiograph to ensure
 resolution.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend repeat lateral radiograph to ensure resolution
 of retrosternal airspace opacification as described above.
