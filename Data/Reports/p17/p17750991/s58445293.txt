 HISTORY:  Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart remains mildly enlarged with left
 ventricular predominance.  The aorta is tortuous.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures but no frank pulmonary edema is detected. 
 Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are again noted.  There are streaky
 bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis, without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  There are
 multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  Small hiatal hernia is
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
