                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue, history of cholangitis and liver disease, portal
 vein thrombus, status post cholecystectomy, assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lungs appear
 clear without focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax.  A retrocardiac
 density is compatible with a hiatal hernia with large known esophageal
 varices.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Heart is normal in
 size.  Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
