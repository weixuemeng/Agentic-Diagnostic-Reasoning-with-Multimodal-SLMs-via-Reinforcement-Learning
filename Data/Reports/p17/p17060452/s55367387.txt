                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  
 
 Syncope, fall.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The aorta is mildly tortuous.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  6 mm nodular opacity projecting over the
 right mid lung field likely reflects a granuloma.  Lungs are hyperinflated,
 with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices
 suggestive of underlying COPD.  Scarring within the lung apices is present. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
