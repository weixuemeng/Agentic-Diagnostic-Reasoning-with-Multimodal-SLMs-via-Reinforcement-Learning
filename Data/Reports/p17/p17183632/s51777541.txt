 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an unchanged
 right-sided PICC line.  The line shows a normal course, the tip of the line
 projects over the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
 
 The lung volumes continue to be high, at the edge of overinflation.  Unchanged
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
