                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever with history of recent international travel.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to CT
 neck from ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Scarring in the left apex is
 better assessed on CT neck.  In addition to the scarring, nodular opacity at
 the very lower edge of the images is demonstrated on the CT neck corresponding
 to a 9-mm nodule seen on the chest radiograph.  There are no other nodules, or
 masses demonstrated.  Pleural thickening on the left versus minimal amount of
 pleural effusion is noted.
 
 Given the patient's history, correlation with chest CT might be considered.
