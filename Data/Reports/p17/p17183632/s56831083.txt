                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Esophageal stent remains in place, unchanged in appearance. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Within the lungs,
 linear opacities in the left upper and lower lobes likely represent linear
 scar and/or atelectasis.  Left-sided pleural opacity corresponds to a
 combination of calcified pleural thickening and extrapleural fat on recent CT.
 No new areas of consolidation are evident in the lung, and there are no
 pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
