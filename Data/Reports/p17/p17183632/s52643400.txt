 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier.
 
 Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to
 known cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion are unchanged.  Stent in the
 esophagus is in unchanged position.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left
 side, are unchanged, could be due to aspiration.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
