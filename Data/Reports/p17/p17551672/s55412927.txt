                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Prior radiographs from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1 cm above the
 carina.  There is also an orogastric tube that terminates in the gastric
 cardia.  The heart appears mild-to-moderately enlarged; although it is
 difficult to compare differences in technique, the size is probably increased.
 There is also some widening of the vascular pedicle suggesting fluid overload.
 Although there is mild asymmetry with greater opacification of the right lung
 and left, diffuse bilateral opacification is present, partly favoring the
 central areas.  However, there is no definite pleural effusion and no evidence
 for pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New diffuse bilateral opacification, although mildly asymmetric. 
 Cardiomegaly, perhaps somewhat increased.  Differential considerations include
 acute respiratory distress syndrome stemming from pneumonia, pulmonary edema
 or diffuse pneumonia.  However, given how mild the pneumonia appeared only
 three days ago and rapid onset of diffuse opacification with cardiomegaly,
 pulmonary edema may be favored.  Clinical correlation is recommended, however.
 Low positioning of endotracheal tube and proximal positioning of nasogastric
 tubes, which could be repositioned somewhat for more optimal positioning if
 clinically indicated.
