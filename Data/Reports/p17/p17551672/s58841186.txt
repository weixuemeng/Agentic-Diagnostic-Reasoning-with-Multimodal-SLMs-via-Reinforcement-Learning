                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 9:32
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with volume overload, now rising white
 count, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 4:10.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 10:00 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in patient positioning.  There has been interval improvement but persistent
 bilateral airspace process suggestive of resolving pulmonary edema.  More
 focal airspace consolidation at the left base may reflect compressive
 atelectasis in the setting of an effusion; however, an acute infectious
 process cannot be excluded, especially in a patient with a rising white count.
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No pneumothorax.
