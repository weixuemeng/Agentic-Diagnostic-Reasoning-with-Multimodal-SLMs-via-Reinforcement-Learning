                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  In the
 interval since the prior study, there has been development of prominence of
 the central pulmonary vasculature.  The perihilar opacity is worrisome for
 fluid overload, less likely infection.  No large pleural effusion is seen. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests vascular
 congestion, less likely infection.
