                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with symptoms suspicious for ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been slight reduction in right pleural effusion and an
 increase in the aeration of the right lung.  Pulmonary edema also appears
 slightly improved; however there still remains significant pleural effusion
 and pulmonary edema.  Dense left retrocardiac lower lobe consolidation is
 unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  An ET tube is seen in position
 terminating no less than 5.8 cm from the carina.  An NG tube is seen entering
 the stomach and then out of field of view.  A right IJ catheter is seen
 terminating within the upper right atrium and can be pulled back by 3 cm so
 that it terminates within the low SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Slight interval improvement in right pleural effusion, right lung aeration
 and pulmonary edema.  However,large quantity of pleural effusion and
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema still remains. Findings are consistent with
 cardiogenic edema, less likely ARDS.
 2.  Persistent dense left lower lobe consolidation consistent with
 atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
