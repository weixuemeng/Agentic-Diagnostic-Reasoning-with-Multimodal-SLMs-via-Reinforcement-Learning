                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory distress, crackles, followup pulmonary edema and
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Asymmetric increasing opacities in the
 right upper lobe, left lower lobe and right lower lobe are a combination of
 pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is
 probably a small left pleural effusion.
