 HISTORY:  CNS lymphoma treated with methotrexate and Rituximab now with a
 congested cough.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.  CT chest ___.  
 
 FRONTAL LATERAL VIEWS CHEST:  A right port is unchanged in position,
 terminating within the right atrium.  There is no evidence of catheter
 malfunction.
 
 Lungs remain mildly hyperinflated.  Streaky atelectasis in the right mid lung
 is unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace
 consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  A small right lower lobe nodule is
 better evaluated on the prior chest CT.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are normal.  The hilar structures are unremarkable.
