                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma, on high-dose
 methotrexate, who presents for evaluation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilum and mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  The lungs appear well expanded and clear.  There is no evidence
 of pleural effusions on the frontal radiograph or pneumothorax.  The
 visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute abnormalities identified. Specifically, no evidence of pleural
 effusion on the single frontal radiograph.
 
 NOTE: Assessment of pleural effusion is limited on single AP radiographs as up
 to 300 cc's of pleural fluid can hide in the posterior pleural space. Would
 recommend lateral view to definitively rule out pleural effusions.
