                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dementia with fever to 104.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation.  The presence of a dense
 left breast prosthesis obscures assessment of the left lung base and heart. 
 Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but grossly unchanged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Upper zone vascular
 redistribution is likely due to supine positioning, without overt pulmonary
 edema.  Patchy opacity within the right lung base may reflect infection or
 aspiration.  There may be a patchy opacity in the left lung base but
 assessment is suboptimal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly seen
 on this supine exam.  No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect infection or aspiration. There may be
 additional left basilar opacification however assessment is limited due to the
 presence of overlying breast prosthesis.
