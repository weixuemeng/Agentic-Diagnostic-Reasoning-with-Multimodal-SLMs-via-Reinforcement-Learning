                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior radiographs for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is
 accompanied by minimal peribronchial cuffing and slight vascular
 indistinctness.  Linear areas of atelectasis are present at both lung bases,
 but there are no confluent areas of consolidation.  Small pleural effusions
 are also demonstrated.  Increased volumes of the lungs suggest the possibility
 of underlying COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
