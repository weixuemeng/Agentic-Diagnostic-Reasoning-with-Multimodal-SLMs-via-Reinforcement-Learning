                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with a question of right lower lobe infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
 radiographs:
 
 Overall lung volumes indicate hyperinflation, probably COPD, either emphysema
 or small airways obstruction or both.  Right middle lobe is collapsed.  There
 could be a central hilar mass responsible.  CT scanning would be definitive in
 that regard, provided the patient can tolerate intravenous contrast agent. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear of anything focal.  Cardiomediastinal silhouettes
 and left hilus and pleural surfaces are normal.  Lower pole of the right hilus
 is obscured by the middle lobe atelectasis.
