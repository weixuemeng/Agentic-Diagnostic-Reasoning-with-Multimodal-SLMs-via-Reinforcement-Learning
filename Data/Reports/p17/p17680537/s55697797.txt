                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Heart block, single chamber pacemaker.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.  No other imaging available for comparison.
 
 Left-sided pacemaker terminates at the expected location of the right
 ventricle, though the tip is relatively posterior, although still most likely
 within the right ventricle.  The heart size is normal.  There is prominence of
 the azygos lobe as well as bilateral upper mediastinum dilatation that may be
 related to enlarged thyroid gland or vasculature.  Lymphadenopathy cannot be
 excluded.  In addition, there is right middle lobe atelectasis with prominence
 of the hilum, highly concerning for obstructing lesion, especially given
 bulging of the fissure on the lateral view.  No pleural effusion is seen on
 the left.  Small amount of pleural effusion is suspected on the right.  Rest
 of the lungs are hyperinflated but essentially clear.  Correlation with chest
 CT, preferably after injection of IV contrast is recommended.
