                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with septic shock from urinary source,
 intubated now with ? VAP  // Please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is mildly congested with mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral
 effusions are larger and the right lower lobe is probably collapsed. 
 Consolidation in the right upper lung is similar to 2 days ago.  Consolidation
 of the left lung has progressed significantly from 2 days ago an is now
 diffuse and overall slightly worse than the right side. No pneumothorax.
 
 Lines and tubes:
 ET tube tip is approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. Left IJ venous line tip
 is in the lower SVC. NG tube and esophageal probe positions and tip locations
 are not significantly changed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Multi focal pneumonia has progressed to the left upper lobe.
 2. Bilateral effusions are larger, probably contributing to right lower lobe
 collapse.
