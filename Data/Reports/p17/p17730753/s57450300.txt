                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with fevers, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
 Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is minimal atelectasis in the lung
 bases. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests trace pleural
 effusions bilaterally. No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.  Known extensive sclerotic metastatic disease is better
 assessed on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable mild bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral
 pleural effusions.
